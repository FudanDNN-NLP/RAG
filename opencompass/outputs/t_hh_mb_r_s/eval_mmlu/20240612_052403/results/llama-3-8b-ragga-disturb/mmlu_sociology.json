Shlapentokh links the significant role of ideology in society to the role of the elites, particularly the political elites.

Psychological deterioration followed on social disorganization: 'as family, church, and traditional political ties weaken, a psychological atomization takes place.'

As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster. Another important and commonly studied aspect of the urban society is poverty, which is believed to be a problem that arises out of urbanism. the understanding of urban society: with the rapid rate of globalization, many peasant societies are quickly attempting to modernize their cities and populations, but at an expense of the interests of the people within the cities. Focuses on these factors include studies on rural-urban migration, kinship in the city, problems that arise from urbanism, and social stratification. These studies are largely comparative \n\n Human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments.

An example would be the selective application of drug laws ... against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations\" Academic Noam Chomsky argues that drug laws are currently, and have historically, been used by the state to oppress sections of society it opposes: \"Very commonly substances are criminalized because they're associated with what's called the dangerous classes, poor people, or working people. Additionally, though research has been conducted, it is recognized that there is not enough substantial empirical research to conclude that the use of cannabis leads to amotivational syndrome.

Social class, generally described as a combination of educational attainment, income and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America. Upper-middle-class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values. Previously it had been common for girls to be educated by a private tutor, an approach which led to young women growing up with a feeling of isolation from their peers. The emerging middle classes also could not afford private tuition for their daughters, and while anxious not to send them to poor schools, took advantage of the growing number of private schools for girls, of which there were at least one in most English cities by 1878.\n\n now studies following people from Europe to America over their lifetimes. For most of American history, social class barriers were fundamentally rigid, with various private and public institutions enforcing rules based on racial segregation and other forms of classifying people based on prejudices such as antisemitism and Hispanophobia.

Gemeinschaft relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society. Max Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Geert Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals. Hofstede insights describes collectivism as: \"Collectivism, represents a preference for a tightly-knit framework in society in which individuals can expect their relatives or members of a particular ingroup to look after them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.\" As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as \"historical, invariant, or generalisable\" as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\"). \"[Sociology is] ... the \n\nSociety is a complex construct that encompasses a wide range of characteristics. Firstly, society is organized in a systematic way, with individuals coming together to form groups and communities. It refers to the shared beliefs, customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next. It involves the division of society into various social groups, such as families, communities, and social classes. These are established systems or organizations that serve specific functions and fulfill collective needs. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. Society is not a static concept but rather a dynamic entity that evolves and adapts over time. These structures may include educational institutions, economic systems, religious organizations, political systems, and legal frameworks. It is through these systems of relations between individuals that societies are formed, sustained, and transformed over time. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: gemeinschaft (usually translated as \"community\") and gesellschaft (\"society\" or \"association\"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a \"unity of will\". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Inventions of the 20th century such as AC electric power, the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with greater inequality. Another explanation is that the combination of the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers, and the failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient \n\nDuring the Reagan years, despite his claims of scaling back the welfare state and cutting tax rates, the economic well-being of Americans did not improve significantly. Income inequality actually increased during this time, and the rate of poverty at the end of Reagan's term remained the same as in 1980. One factor contributing to the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was the cutbacks in income transfers during the Reagan years. These cutbacks helped increase both poverty and inequality. However, changes in tax policy did have some impact on reducing poverty and increasing inequality. It's important to note that the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was not solely due to policy choices during the Reagan Administration. There were broader social and economic factors at play, such as widening income differences and challenges faced by families in staying out of poverty. Overall, while the standard of living improved to some extent during the Reagan years, there were persistent issues of income inequality and poverty that were not adequately addressed by the policy measures undertaken. Causes of income inequality in the United States describes the reasons for the unequal distribution of income in the US and the factors that cause it to change over time. Income inequality in the United States grew significantly beginning in the early 1970s,  after several decades of stability. The US consistently exhibits higher rates of income inequality than most developed nations, arguably due to the nation's relatively less regulated markets.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

In particular, the hallucinogen LSD, which at the time was still legal in the United States, was very popular, and in 1966 Anger released a version of his earlier film, Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome titled the \"Sacred Mushroom Edition\" which was screened to people while taking LSD, thereby heightening their sensory experience. By this time, Anger had become well known throughout the underground scene in the United States, and several cinemas across the country screened his better known films all in one event. Soon musicians began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music, just as it was reflected in psychedelic art, literature and film. This trend ran in parallel in both America \n\n that catered to the population of students at nearby Berkeley and the free thinkers that had gravitated to the city. There was already a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians, and in the early 1960s use of drugs including cannabis, peyote, mescaline and LSD began to grow among folk and rock musicians. LSD was declared illegal in the US and UK in 1966. The linking of the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by The Manson Family to Beatles songs such as \"Helter Skelter\" contributed to an anti-hippie backlash. The Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by The Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane on December 6, 1969, did not turn out to be a positive milestone in the psychedelic music scene, as was anticipated; instead, it became notorious for the fatal stabbing of a black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angels security guards.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Frederick Winslow Taylor developed the scientific theory of management which he published in the journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1895. Henry Mintzberg, Peter Drucker and Donella Meadows were three very notable theorists addressing these concerns in the 1980s. Mintzberg and Drucker studied how executives spent their time, Meadows how change and leverage to resist it existed at all levels in all kinds of organizations. Adhocracy, functional leadership models and reengineering were all attempts to detect and remove administrative incompetence. Had managers been more accountable to employees, it is argued, owners and employees would not have been defrauded. Some dismiss so-called \"scientific management\" or Taylorism as pseudoscience. Others are critical of the representativeness of the workers Taylor selected to take his measurements. In management literature today, the term \"scientific management\" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples (\"classical\", implying \"no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value\") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese management culture in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management. Other thinkers, even in Taylor's own time, also proposed considering the individual worker's needs, not just the needs of the process.

According to Marxist feminists, women's liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women's labor is uncompensated. Marxist feminists extend traditional Marxist analysis by applying it to unpaid domestic labor and sex relations. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay \"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex\", in which she coins the phrase \"sex/gender system\" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process. More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions as a result of gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both \n\n Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that private property, which gives rise to economic inequality as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression. According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations—that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit.

But he is now largely concerned with understanding the political culture of Britain as well as the United States and in working in a more overtly post-disciplinary manner. Various political ideologies, such as Christian democracy and certain forms of social and classical liberalism, can be classified as centrist ones, as can the Third Way, a modern political movement that attempts to reconcile right-wing and left-wing politics by advocating for a synthesis of centre-right economic platforms with some centre-left social policies. However, the author does not entirely deny the existing economic and political systems but attempts to reform, reshape and improve them. In the policy format, asset-based egalitarianism is usually seen as the opposite policy proposal of Philippe Van Parijs and his thesis of basic income, but asset-based egalitarian proposals have received less academic attention. However, more recently the wave of third way politics has seen much more emphasis placed on responsibility and equality of opportunity and has reopened an old debate. In actual policy, Gordon Brown and the British Labour Party initiated the United Kingdom Child Trust Fund, while in the United States the idea has been implemented in the form of individual development account and argued for by Michael Sherraden. One of the motivations of the related policy such as the Child Trust Fund is clear from this excerpt:\n\n readers will no doubt find his sweeping indictment of social democracy unfair, his co-optation of avant-garde management theory naive, and his celebration of change and upheaval utopian.

Reasons cited for this controversy include the subjectivity of diagnosis, the use of diagnosis and treatment for social and political control including detaining citizens and treating them without consent, and the side effects of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics and historical procedures like lobotomy and other forms of psychosurgery or insulin shock therapy. There are a number of groups who are either critical towards psychiatry or entirely hostile to the field. The Critical Psychiatry Network is a group of psychiatrists who are critical of psychiatry; there are self-described psychiatric survivor groups such MindFreedom International, religious groups like Scientologists. Background \n\nSince the 1960s there have been challenges to the concept of mental illness. Sociologists Erving Goffman and Thomas Scheff said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; behavioural psychologists challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; gay rights activists criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Since the social enlightenment about homosexuality, it is no longer considered a mental illness and is more widely accepted by society. For many years, some psychiatrists (such as David Rosenhan, Peter Breggin, Paula Caplan, Thomas Szasz) and outside critics (such as Stuart A. Kirk) have \"been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality\". In 2013, Allen Frances said that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". The term medicalization entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of Irving Zola, Peter Conrad and Thomas Szasz, among others. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's \"The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance\", published in 1973 (hyperkinesis was the term then used to describe what we might now call ADHD). These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz, 1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \"psychotechnology\" (Chorover, 1973). Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the clinical, involving serious side effects worse than the original condition; the social, whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the structural, whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively \"medicalized\" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these natural processes. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. Examples of political abuse of the power, entrusted in physicians and particularly psychiatrists, are abundant in history and seen during the Nazi era and the Soviet rule when political dissenters were labeled as \"mentally ill\" and subjected to inhumane \"treatments.\" In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be systematic in the Soviet Union, and occasional in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the People's Republic of China and in Russia. Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of 'sluggish schizophrenia' in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. Nature of diagnosis\n\nArbitrariness \nPsychiatry has been criticized for its broad range of mental diseases and disorders. Which diagnoses exist are considered valid have changed over time depending on society's norms. Historic disorders that are no longer recognised include orthorexia nervosa, sexual addiction, parental alienation syndrome, pathological demand avoidance, Internet addiction disorder. Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.

The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the People's Republic of China and in Russia. Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of 'sluggish schizophrenia' in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. Nature of diagnosis\n\nArbitrariness \nPsychiatry has been criticized for its broad range of mental diseases and disorders. Which diagnoses exist are considered valid have changed over time depending on society's norms. Historic disorders that are no longer recognised include orthorexia nervosa, sexual addiction, parental alienation syndrome, pathological demand avoidance, Internet addiction disorder. Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

The third Labour government's policies attracted a large university-educated liberal contingent to Labour, transforming the party from its working class, trade union roots. The political values were based on a producer's ethic, that is the working class was the truly productive sector of society, and expressed a version of republicanism that was similar to the middle class version. This enabled the businessman's party, the Republican party, to enjoy a strong base among Protestant blue collar workers, and prevented the emergence of a strong Socialist movement. For most of American history, social class barriers were fundamentally rigid, with various private and public institutions enforcing rules based on racial segregation and other forms of classifying people based on prejudices such as antisemitism and Hispanophobia. Issues regarding social class have remained hot-button topics in U.S. politics, with the American Great Recession causing massive socio-economic harm across the country from southerners to northerners to working-class whites to middle-class blacks\n\n Many theories of imperialism have been used to explain a perceived tendency towards reformism, chauvinism, or social-imperialism among the labor aristocracy, a privileged section of the working population in core countries, or alternatively the whole population. According to Eric Hobsbawm, the term was coined by Engels in an 1885 introduction to The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, but it described a phenomenon which was already a familiar topic in English socio-political debate. This evidently described by Sociologist M. Lipset during the latter half of the 20th century were liberal democratic working class advocated for their party to represent their problems In the 1950s but quickly diminished during the 1970s as class relations in political partnership was dissolving. This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain's politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Traditional focuses of sociology include \n\nSociety can be understood as a complex web of relationships and interactions between individuals. It encompasses the collective organization of people who share common interests, values, and norms. It includes various social structures, institutions, and systems that shape human behavior and influence the way people live and interact with one another. Society also involves the establishment of social norms, which are shared expectations and behaviors that guide individuals' conduct and facilitate social order. These structures may include educational institutions, economic systems, religious organizations, political systems, and legal frameworks. They provide the framework through which individuals operate and contribute to the functioning of society as a whole. The study of society is a multidisciplinary field, drawing insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences to understand the complexity and dynamics of human interactions in a societal context. In summary, society encompasses the intricate network of relationships, social structures, institutions, and cultural factors that shape human behavior and interactions. It is through these systems of relations between individuals that societies are formed, sustained, and transformed over time. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. Some of the key features of society include its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. It involves the division of society into various social groups, such as families, communities, and social classes. Finally, institutions play a vital role in society. These are established systems or organizations that serve specific functions and fulfill collective needs. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. Institutions provide a framework for social interaction and governance, helping to maintain order and stability within society. In summary, society is characterized by its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. These characteristics intertwine to shape the fabric of society and influence the behavior and interactions of individuals within it. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Therefore, emotion is less consistent than attitude. Attitude is harder to change than emotion. Emotion plays a dominant role \n\nThe role of proactive personality in mitigating the negative effects of emotional dissonance on workers' mental health in customer-facing roles is significant. According to a study on mass-retail employees, proactive personality emerged as a protective factor against conflicts with clients, especially among employees experiencing high levels of emotional dissonance. They actively take steps to manage their emotions and engage in adaptive strategies to handle emotional demands effectively. Emotional dissonance, which refers to the internal experience of mismatched emotions, was found to be associated with more hostile customer relations. Identifying resources that enable the management of emotional demands is crucial in developing suitable adaptive strategies for individuals in customer-facing roles. A study conducted among dual-earner couples found that engaging in surface acting at work can have ripple effects on employees' energetic resources and relationship satisfaction at home. According to the study, employees who engage in surface acting at work tend to experience work-related exhaustion. This exhaustion acts as a mediating factor, meaning it partially explains the relationship between surface acting at work and at home. In other words, surface acting at work can drain employees' energetic resources, leading to increased levels of exhaustion. Furthermore, the study also found that surface acting at home can impact both the individual and their partner's satisfaction with the relationship. This relationship satisfaction is influenced by the individual's emotional energy, which is reduced as a result of surface acting at home. Recognizing the potential impact on employees' energetic resources and relationship satisfaction, organizations can work towards creating a supportive and authentic work environment that acknowledges and addresses employees' emotional needs. found that expressions of positive mood by the leader improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings. In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

It is the movement between different socio-economic stratas, which can be influenced by various factors such as education, occupation, income, and wealth. People with a higher level of social mobility have the opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status and experience upward mobility, while those with limited mobility may find it challenging to escape poverty or advance economically. In societies with higher social mobility, individuals have a greater chance of overcoming their circumstances and achieving success independent of their social background. but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables:  Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries. It involves the ability of individuals to change their social class or economic status over time. Conversely, limited educational opportunities can hinder social mobility. Social barriers, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status, can also hinder social mobility. These barriers create systemic disadvantages for certain groups and limit their upward mobility. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Weber described four categories of \"Ideal Types\" of behavior: zweckrational (goal-rationality), wertrational (value-rationality), affektual (emotional-rationality) and traditional (custom, unconscious habit). Weber, who is keenly aware of the fictional nature of the \"ideal type\", therefore states that it never seeks to claim its validity in terms of a reproduction of or \n\n1) Instrumental rational (zweckrational): action \"determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as 'conditions' or \"means' for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends.\" The classic names instrumental and intrinsic were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs. Weber's \"instrumental rationality\" and Rawls's \"the rational\" became actors' \"causally expected utility\"—satisfaction with workmanlike behavior—and \"evidentially expected utility\"—satisfaction with predicted utility after successful instrumental action. Weber's \"value rationality\" and Rawls's “the reasonable” became actors' \"symbolic utility\"—satisfaction with behavior that, in itself, symbolizes universal justice. Because he applied meanings for charisma similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity, Weber's charisma would have coincided with the divinely conferred charisma sense defined above in Sohm's work. Weber introduced the personality charisma sense when he applied charisma to designate a form of authority. To explain charismatic authority he developed his classic definition:\"Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as \n\n  The German scholar Max Weber proposed an interpretation of social action that distinguished between four different idealized types of rationality.

In Catholic ecclesiology, a church is an assembly of the faithful, hierarchically ordered, both in the entire world (the Catholic Church), or in a certain territory (a particular church). More specifically, it is the local bishop, with his priests and deacons gathered around and assisting him in his office of teaching, sanctifying and governing (Mt. Many are formally organized, with constitutions and by-laws, maintain offices, are served by clergy or lay leaders, and, in nations where this is permissible, often seek non-profit corporate status.

When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure. He argues that criminal behavior is learned in the same way that all other behaviors are learned, meaning that the acquisition of criminal knowledge is not unique compared to the learning of other behaviors. Sutherland outlined some very basic points in his theory, including the idea that the learning comes \n\nThe uneven distribution of criminal victimization across space and time.
