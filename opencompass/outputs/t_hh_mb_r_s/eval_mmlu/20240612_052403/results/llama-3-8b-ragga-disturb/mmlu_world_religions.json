Murti are also found in some nontheistic Jainism traditions, where they serve as symbols of revered mortals inside Jain temples, and are worshiped in murtipujaka rituals. Ancient era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas. The expressions in a murti vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from Ugra symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence (Durga, Kali), as \n\n  The garbhagriha or inner shrine of a Hindu temple contains an image of the deity. Meaning literally \"embodiment\", a murti is a representation of a divinity, made usually of stone, wood, or metal, which serves as a means through which a divinity may be worshiped. In Hinduism, states Jeaneane Fowler, a murti itself is not god, it is an \"image of god\" and thus a symbol and representation. Thus a literal translation \n\n murti as 'idol' is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it. It contrasts with mind, thought and the immaterial in ancient Indian literature. The term also refers to any embodiment, manifestation, incarnation, personification, appearance, image, idol or statue of a deity. The earliest mention of the term murti occurs in primary Upanishads composed in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly in verse 3.2 of Aitareya Upanishad, verse 1.13 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, verse 6.14 of Maitrayaniya Upanishad and verse 1.5 of Prashna Upanishad.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

Aristotle and Theophrastus together formulated the new science of biology, inductively, case by case, for two years before Aristotle was called to tutor Alexander. Aristotle performed no modern-style experiments in the form in which they appear in today's physics and chemistry laboratories. Induction is not afforded the status of scientific reasoning, and so it is left to intuition to provide a solid foundation for Aristotle's science. With that said, Aristotle brings us somewhat closer an empirical science than his predecessors. Aristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences. In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.

He is said to have taught that chabana should give the viewer the same impression that those flowers naturally would give if they were still growing outdoors, in nature. of Japanese rock garden or zen garden, where a real waterfall is suggested by a composition of stones.

Excursions and picnics for enjoying flowers, particularly cherry blossoms are also common, as well as many drinking parties often to be seen in and around auspicious parks and buildings. The subject of flower viewing has long held an important place in literature, dance, and fine arts. A kenzan (剣山), also called spiky frog, is a specific device used in the Japanese art of flower arrangement ikebana for fixing the flowers in the container. It was introduced by the Moribana style of ikebana.

The Dharmashastra is a record of these guidelines and rules. The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras. Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality. caturtha pramāṇa), is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy.

Of these, the most cited one is Manusmriti, which describes the four Varnas, their rights and duties. Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.

Regardless of its historical veracity the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to fit contemporary heresies with those combated by the church fathers. Not all Cathars held that The Evil God (or principle) was as powerful as The Good God (also called a principle) as Mani did, a belief also known as absolute dualism. In the case of the Cathars, it seems they adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization, but none of its religious cosmology. Similarly, Priscillian and his followers apparently tried to absorb what they thought was the valuable part of Manichaeaism into Christianity. The Gnostic doctrine of the identity of Adam, as the original man, with the Messiah appears in Mani in his teaching of the \"Redeeming Christ,\" who has His abode in the sun and moon, but is identical with the original man. It also appears in this theory that Adam was the first of the sevenfold series of true prophets, comprising Adam, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. Of this conception, however, there remains in the later Mandaean writings little more than the expression \"Gabra Ḳadmaya\" (Adam Ḳadmon). He even retains the Jewish designations \"Adam Kadmon\" (= אדם קדמון) and \"Nakhash Kadmon\" (= נחש קדמון), as may be seen in the Fihrist. But, according to Mani, the original man is fundamentally distinct from the first father of the human race.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements. They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with Quanzhen Dao. Zhengyi Daoists became common in the Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Fujian provinces of China, as well as in Taiwan. Daoism's biggest known conceptions are folk religion, the Celestial Masters, and Quanzhen Daoism in the modern era since Wang Changyue launched a renaissance of the Quanzhen. In 1949, after the communists dominated mainland China, the 63rd Celestial Master, Zhang Enpu (張恩溥), migrated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government. Building temples, effigies and fasting was practiced by Daoists to gain blessings. Celestial Masters north branch under Kou Qianzhi worshipped divinities described in the 魏書 Book of Wei. Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi were where the Celestial Masters northern branch operated, while Louguan and Guanzhong Daoism developed around Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi. Celestial Masters are not believed to be connected with stele founded in Shaanxi.

Buddhism accepts the principle of anattā, according to which there is no concept of self. There is no supernatural being applying its own will to determine someone's fate: \"[...] beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement.\" Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being\" (Dalai Lama). Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: \"The more we care for the \n\nConfucianism stresses that leadership and education are central to morality. ; Buddhism refers to the teachings of the \"Enlightened One,\" which state that life is full of suffering brought on by human desire and attachment. Virtues are of utmost importance, and include love, joy, compassion, and composure. ; Hinduism emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. It advocates for the harmonious union among all individuals, who should strive for ultimate self-improvement and also encouraged to be good to others. Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism \n\nIn Buddhism, there are several key aspects of medical ethics that relate to moral duty, moral rights, being considered a \"Good guy,\" and the importance of understanding the real world in the context of moral decision-making. According to Buddhism, moral duty is the cause that leads to moral rights. This includes showing mercy, kindness, and compassion towards the underprivileged, as well as donating money, land, or properties. It involves recognizing that the world around us is impermanent and full of illusions. Simultaneously, we should also examine the \"Within us\" aspect, understanding that our physical body and various elements are impermanent and not something to be excessively attached to. Practicing salvation while still alive is also a concept worth considering in Buddhism. Live salvation exists within us and can be achieved through mindfulness and cultivating wholesome qualities.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.
