Nomination records are strictly sealed \n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz made significant contributions to both physics and society. In the field of physics, Lorentz played a crucial role in the development of the classical theory of electromagnetism. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, Lorentz formulated the electron theory, which provided electromagnetism with its final form. Lorentz's contributions to theoretical physics were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. Furthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired. Around 1904–1905, the works of Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and finally Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, exclude the possibility of propagation of any effects faster than the speed of light. From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his equivalence principle as a key concept to guide his way. According \n\n Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. There is evidence from Einstein's writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. This paper predicted that, when \n\n Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

This is called skywave or \"skip\" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 64 km (40 miles). Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. Short-wave Radio ; Short-wave (or Amateur) radio is a relatively long range method of communicating using radio waves. Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries. At this time, not all of their antennas appear to be in use. Their main targeted services are titled Global-I through Global-IV. The Marine Radiotelephone Service or HF ship-to-shore operates on shortwave radio frequencies, using single-sideband modulation. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet.

Player characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. During battle, each character has health points (HP) and magic points (MP). HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked. The game ends when all of the characters' HP levels reach zero, although the player can continue from the beginning of the battle or the last checkpoint. Unless enhanced or affected, the player and their allies in the Party Roster will start with 8 action points. The player can use magically enhanced spores, pods, and rods to heal and strengthen themselves and their allies. There are three main classes of creations - Magical, who specialize in magical projectiles; Battle, who specialize in close combat; and Fire, who use a mix of projectiles and melee. Players are able to perform two types of attacks: a Bravery attack and an HP attack. Both characters start with a set number of Bravery points, the number of Bravery points being equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by an HP attack. Thus, the player must perform several Bravery attacks to steal Bravery points from the opponent so as to increase the power of their HP attack, as Bravery attacks do not cause any damage.\n\nQuestion: what does hp mean in war and order\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Candidates are not elected directly by the citizens, but by the Members of Legislative Assemblies and up to 12  can be nominated by the President of India for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members of the Parliament in Rajya Sabha get a tenure of six years, with one-third of the body facing re-election every two years. Rajya Sabha acts as a second-level review body before a bill becomes an act. The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions.

Later she represented Sangli constituency in the Indian parliament (Lok Sabha) during a period in the 1980s. She represented the constituency of Koregaon, Satara in the Maharashtra state legislative assembly, the (Vidhan Sabha) from 1999 to 2009. Prior to that she unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1990 and 1995 for the Janata dal and as an independent respectively. During the 1970s, she founded a charity called Rajmata Jijau Pratishthan to raise funds for hospitals for the poor and women related activities. A key event in the spread of the disease across metropolitan France as well as its overseas territories was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February 2020 in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus. This was extended twice and ended on 11 May 2020, after a progressive lifting of lockdown and as face masks were made available to all citizens. On 2 May 2020, Health Minister Olivier Véran announced that the government would seek to extend the health emergency period until 24 July 2020. Véran's bill was discussed in Senate on 4 May 2020. On 15 October 2020, police raided the homes and offices of key government officials, including Véran and Philippe, in a criminal negligence probe opened by the Cour de Justice de la République. On 31 March 2021, Macron announced a third national lockdown which commenced on 3 April 2021 and which was mandated for all of April 2021; measures included the closure of non-essential shops, the suspension of school attendance, a ban on domestic travel and a nationwide curfew from 7pm-6am. Background \nThe pandemic occurred following a series of national protests, which were followed by a strike against pension reform which had been proposed by President Emmanuel Macron in his election manifesto. In President Emmanuel Macron's second address to the nation on the pandemic on 16 March 2020, he announced the suspension of all reforms, notably those of pensions. On 21 January 2020, Agnès Buzyn, Minister of Solidarity and Health declared that \"The risk of introduction into France is low but it cannot be excluded\". On 27 December 2019, a man was admitted to Avicenne Hospital and tested for influenza, which came back as negative. Cohen said it was too early to know if the man had been France's \"patient zero\". He was placed in isolation, and the authorities tried to trace people who had been in contact with him. The 31-year-old man and his 30-year-old partner, both from Wuhan, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised at Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris. On 26 January 2020, Buzyn declared that the French government had millions of masks which could be distributed to the population if necessary. On 28 January 2020, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist from Hubei tested positive and was hospitalised at Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital. On 31 January 2020, Marie Fontanel, the President counselor for solidarity and health, quit her job to help her husband in the coming municipal elections. She would be replaced only one month later. The same day, all the countries of the Schengen Area, except France, suspended the issuing of visas in China. They contracted the infection from a British national who had attended a conference in Singapore a few days before. On 18 February 2020, Minister of Health, Olivier Véran – who replaced Agnès Buzyn after she stood down to run in the Paris mayoral election for La République En Marche! The same day, during an audition by the French Senate, Jérôme Salomon, the French Directeur général de la Santé, declared that \"A mask shortage is not a subject\". The annual gathering of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February 2020 in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people became a significant cluster in the spread of coronavirus in France. On 3 March 2020, seven participants in the evangelical rally – including five members of a local family and a general practitioner from Bernwiller – had tested positive for the virus. According to an investigative report by Radio France, at least half of the attendees had contracted the virus; in an interview on France Info, the pastor of the church admitted that 2000 attendees may have been infected. It is said that no specific health advice existed in light of the threat at the time. Even President Emmanuel Macron had spent several hours electioneering on 18 February 2020 in the Bourtzwiller district close to the church. On 5 March 2020, a retired couple from Lot-et-Garonne and another person from Deux-Sèvres who had attended the same Mulhouse gathering were declared positive for the disease. The department of Haut-Rhin, in which Mulhouse is situated, imposed strict limits on the gatherings; all schools were closed henceforth. Municipal elections \n\nThe first round of municipal elections in France took place on 15 March 2020 against the backdrop of the government decision to move to Stage III of measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Then-Health Minister, Agnès Buzyn, resigned on 16 February 2020 to run for the Paris mayor for La République En Marche!. She is succeeded by Olivier Véran, a neurologist. The decision to press ahead with the election was justified as being critical to democratic life in the country, despite concerns about how a second round could be held as the toll of infections and deaths continued to rise. In the end, the turnout of registered voters was 40%, lower than achieved in 1971 – the previous record lowest turnout. On 12 March 2020, Emmanuel Macron announced in a televised address that all schools and universities across the country would be closed. On 13 March 2020, the Prime Minister, Édouard Philippe announced the closure of all pubs, restaurants, cinemas and nightclubs. On 16 March 2020 (one day after the first round of the municipal elections), Emmanuel Macron announced the beginning of a lockdown period from 17 March 2020 at noon. After the announcement of the lockdown, the Fédération Française du Bâtiment decided to stop non-essential work because of the danger for construction workers. On 19 March 2020, Muriel Pénicaud, the French Minister of Labour, criticized this decision, saying that it showed a lack of civic spirit. On 20 March 2020, the President of the federation replied in an open letter that what the Minister said was \"scandalous\". After several days, an agreement allowing a few construction sites to reopen was signed. The lockdown had initially been planned for 15 days, then for 30 days, but on 13 April 2020, Macron announced that the lockdown period would be extended until 11 May 2020. On 28 May 2020, Édouard Philippe announced that a travel ban of 100 km (62 miles) would be lifted on 2 June 2020. This easing of restrictions did not apply to Paris. On 3 July 2020, Philippe resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Jean Castex. Castex had previously been appointed coordinator of the phasing out of the lockdown (confinement) implemented in France. On 15 July 2020, Olivier Véran announced that from 24 July 2020, face coverings would be compulsory in all public indoor spaces and some outdoor public areas such as the Eiffel Tower. With this in mind, Paris made it compulsory to wear face coverings in most public spaces. However, the government kept insisting that they would not impose a second nationwide lockdown. President Macron announced in an interview on prime-time television on 14 October 2020 that in view of the vertiginous spread of the disease in several major cities, there would be 9 pm–6am curfews imposed in areas which have become hotspots for the virus in the country, to last for 4 weeks; the financial aid measures and furloughing scheme for affected business would be re-introduced. On 22 October 2020, Prime Minister of France Jean Castex extended the overnight curfew to 38 more departments as cases surged, affecting 46 million people (67% population). On 28 October 2020, Macron announced on a televised address that France would enter a second nationwide lockdown from 30 October 2020 that would last until at least 1 December 2020. Non-essential businesses such as pubs and restaurants would close but schools and factories would remain open. November 2020 \nOn 5 November 2020, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced further restrictions in Paris after some citizens were caught disobeying existing rules. These included requiring food shops to close at 10:00 pm to prevent people from gathering there. On 12 November 2020, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said in a press conference that any loosening of restrictions at the start of December would be \"strictly limited\", meaning businesses like restaurants, bars and sports halls would remain closed. December 2020 \nOn 17 December 2020, Macron tested positive for COVID-19. She received the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the René-Muret Hospital in Sevran, Seine-Saint-Denis. 2021 \nOn 31 March 2021, in a televised address to the nation, President Macron announced a third national lockdown to begin on 3 April 2021, and to last for at least a month. Macron warned that the country would \"lose control if we do not move now\". Principal measures announced included the closure of non-essential shops during the national lockdown and the suspension of attendance at schools for three weeks. On 29 April, President Macron announced dates for the easing of restrictions from the third national lockdown:\n\n 19 May: Curfew moves from 19:00 to 21:00. Shops, museums, cinemas, terraces, outdoor sports venues can reopen. 2022 \nOn 5 January, President Macron said he, \"really wants to piss off the non-vaccinated\". On 13 January, the French Senate approves President Macron's new set of measures that include a vaccine pass to enter public facilitates. One day later his wife was hospitalised. On 27 February, a friend and his daughter followed him into the hospital. On 2 March 2020, 26 people were COVID-19 positive in Haute-Savoie. The hospital in Annecy being saturated, a case was transferred to Chambéry. François Daviet, the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy was also hospitalised. On 27 February 2020, a man from Francheville was admitted to a Lyon hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. On the same day, two other men from Ferney-Voltaire, one French national who works in Switzerland and one Italian national, were also hospitalised in the Helvetic Country. On 2 March 2020, an 89-year-old woman from Nyons was treated at Valréas hospital in the Enclave of the Popes in Vaucluse and tested COVID-19 positive. Two were in the western city of Brest, an elderly man from Plougonvelin, returning from a trip from Egypt and his wife. The man had returned from Italy and was hospitalised first, followed by his wife. The five departments of Hauts-de-France now each had at least one proven case of people infected by the coronavirus. On 2 March 2020, it was announced the second death in Hauts-de-France and the third at the national level, a woman of 89 \"diagnosed post-mortem\" at the hospital of Compiègne. Île-de-France \nOn 25 February 2020, a young woman returned from China was hospitalised in the Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris but showed signs of recovery and was out of hospital on 26 February 2020. He was working for a contractor of Charles de Gaulle Airport. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial International Women's Day march occurred in Paris on 8 March 2020. He is a French resident in Eure. She lived near Compiègne, in the Oise department, where a dozen cases had already been identified. The first case was detected on 28 February 2020; a 27-year-old woman from the Sarthe declared herself to the SAMU centre 15 after a stay in Milan in Italy. A young woman from Cannes was infected after a journey in Milan. This replaced local measures which had already been taken in Nice, Béziers, and Cannes. The first death was announced on 20 April 2020. Overseas and sui generis collectivities\n\nFrench Polynesia \n\nMaina Sage, a French politician representing French Polynesia at the French national assembly, was diagnosed with the first case of COVID-19 in French Polynesia on 11 March 2020. Their son, who lives on the neighbouring island of Saint Barthélemy, also tested positive. Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier\n\nThe Ministry of Armed Forces reported infections on board one of its ships on 8 April 2020. The ministry initially announced that out of 66 personnel tested, 50 were positive. Three sailors were evacuated by air to . There was criticism in France the carrier mission was not interrupted after the first cases were detected, and rumours that the carrier had asked permission to interrupt its mission in mid March during its stopover in Brest, which had been refused. Florence Parly, the French Minister of Armed Forces, said that these rumours were false when questioned by French deputies. Effects on civilian life\n\nClosures \nOn 28 February 2020, the fashion designer agnès b. cancelled fashion shows in Paris Fashion Week, which had been scheduled to run until 3 March. In a televised statement on 12 March 2020, President of the Republic Emmanuel Macron decreed the closure of nurseries, schools, colleges, high schools and universities. The Ministry of Health requested the deprogramming of non-urgent surgical procedures. From the next day, gatherings of more than 100 people were prohibited. Without this declaration individuals could be fined if found engaging in non-essential movement. Initially it was necessary to carry a paper copy of the declaration but later a QR code based electronic equivalent for smartphones became an option. Police around the country set up road blocks to check those outside their homes had good reason and that their exemption declarations were in order. Police report receiving hundreds of telephone denunciations from citizens complaining of their neighbours walking their dogs too often; a woman also denounced her husband for going out to see his mistress. On 28 September 2020, according to an Amnesty International report French authorities wrongly punished thousands of peaceful protesters under draconian laws in pre and post COVID-19 crackdowns. Many people were arbitrarily fined, arrested, and detained for peaceful protests. Unemployment \nPresident Macron announced on 12 March 2020 that companies could postpone the payment of social security contributions and taxes due in March without justification, formalities, or penalties. An \"exceptional and massive\" mechanism of state-funded furloughing (partial lay-offs) was envisaged. Employees were encouraged to practise teleworking where possible. Shortage of masks controversy \n\nStrategic stocks of masks in 2009 under Roselyne Bachelot, minister of health from May 2007 to November 2010, amounted to 1 billion surgical masks and 600 million FFP2 masks. Then-health minister Agnès Buzyn declared on 26 January that there would be no shortage of masks in France during the outbreak. On 3 March, with France still facing a shortage, President Macron commandeered all masks produced and stored in the country for distribution to health professionals and people who had contracted the virus. France was subsequently accused of seizing medical equipment intended for other nations. All had been contracted for, including a million masks each for France, Italy and Spain. On 27 April 2020, it was revealed by Libération that, contrary to government claims in March, a change of doctrine was not the main cause of the mask shortage, and that the government had been fully informed as early as 2018 that strategic reserves were depleted. Raoult has nevertheless offered testing of those with symptoms at his institute and prescribed hydroxychloroquine for those who tested positive. The French Health Minister, Olivier Véran, announced that \"new tests will now go ahead to evaluate the results of Raoult, to independently replicate the trials and ensure the findings are scientifically robust, before any possible decision might be made to roll any treatment out to the wider public\". Chinese Embassy article\n\nIn mid-April 2020, the Chinese embassy published an online article entitled \"Restoring distorted facts – Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris\", which criticised western countries' slow response and accused workers at nursing homes in France of \"abandoning their posts overnight … and leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease\". French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian summoned the Chinese ambassador, and said that the remarks were not in line with the \"quality of the bilateral relationship\" between France and China. Mrs. Patil was well known for speaking her mind, particularly about rights for the Maratha community. During her career, she has campaigned for more seats for women in elected bodies. She has also criticized the Indian Central Government's move to extend 27.5 per cent reservation to OBCs in the central academic institutes such as IITs and IIMs. Since her then party, the Nationalist Congress Party led by Sharad Pawar supported this policy, Shalinitai was expelled from that party in 2006. In 2009, she launched a new party called Krantisena Maharashtra. The party did not attract much support and soon Shalinitai joined the Congress party. been made with regards to Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi who succeeded him as the third Prime Minister of India. These accusation also proved to be partly correct as the then President of India, V. V. Giri conferred this award to Indira Gandhi for steering India to victory in the 14-day-long 1971 war with Pakistan over East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). President V. V. Giri took full responsibility for conferring the honour to Indira. Incidentally, both Nehru and Indira returned the favour to their respective Presidents upon the latters' retirement for which allegation of \"quid pro quo\" were levelled by various people. However, Rajiv Gandhi was awarded Bharat Ratna, without any controversy, posthumously after he was assassinated by LTTE in 1991. It was a unanimous decision of the ruling party and the opposition.\n\nQuestion: who was the first lady nominated member of the rajya sabha\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Among the most well known are Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences. Choreography: Alexander Gorsky (after Petipa) ; Company: Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow ; Premiere: 1919  Russian choreographer Alexander Gorsky, who staged a production of The Nutcracker in Moscow in 1919, is credited with the idea of combining Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy's roles (i.e. The film's score is derived from Tchaikovsky's original music for The Nutcracker, the ballet version of the E.T.A. Many of the songs are based on the ballet's dances. Co-written, directed, and co-produced by Andrei Konchalovsky, the film stars Elle Fanning, Nathan Lane, and John Turturro with Charles Rowe and Shirley Henderson as the Nutcracker. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's popular 1892 ballet The Nutcracker is derived from E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's scenario, crafted by Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa after a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, is far simpler and less nuanced than Hoffmann's original story. Vsevolozhsky and Petipa entirely omitted the Nutcracker character's complex backstory, \"The Story of the Hard Nut,\" and expanded a short, satiric passage set in a Kingdom of Sweets to cover the whole of Act II.\n\nQuestion: swan lake the sleeping beauty and the nutcracker are three famous ballets by\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. He planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial boulevards, 120 ft wide, extending from the center. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail. His model for a garden city was first created at Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer Robert Owen to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by John Bellers’s 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. Enter Ebenezer Howard, creator of the Garden City Movement, who successfully founded Letchworth Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by Bernard Shaw, co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as “entirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.”\n\n Garden city movement was embodied by Ebenezer Howard, as this urban trends took off in the second half of the 19th century.

In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths. Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light. When a central image is projected directly \n\nThe eye is a very complex organ with an incredibly important function. Each part of the eye plays a special role in the visual process that allows us to see. The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time. The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye. The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished. The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre). Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away. The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. This is called adaptation.\n\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure. Oak Island Mystery refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects found on or near Oak Island in Nova Scotia. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. \"The curse\" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found. By this time, there were many shafts, bore holes, and tunnels under Oak Island made by previous treasure hunters.

The neck of the gall bladder connects with the liver via the hepatic duct. When stimulated, the gall bladder releases its secretion, which is bile, into the small intestine through the common bile duct. The gall bladder is lined with a simple columnar epithelial tissue, and its walls are composed of three visible coats: an internal mucous and muscular coat, a middle connective tissue layer, and an outermost serous membrane. The main function of the gall bladder is to store and concentrate bile. While in the gall bladder, the bile undergoes concentration until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. During a fatty meal, the gall bladder contracts to release bile into the small intestine to emulsify fats and neutralize the acids in the partially-digested food. However, it is important to note that the formation of gallstones is a common issue associated with the gall bladder due to its high cholesterol content. In some cases, when gallstones cause complications or persistent symptoms, a surgical procedure called cholecystectomy may be necessary to remove the gall bladder. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat. Food entering the stomach stimulates the production of the chemical cholecystokinin, which causes the gall bladder to release bile into the small intestine through a sphincter known as the ampulla of Vater. **3-SECOND INCISION**\n\nThe liver is the body's largest gland; it removes toxicants, produces bile to assist digestion and breaks down red blood cells. The gall bladder stores bile for use by the small intestine. **3-MINUTE DISSECTION**\n\nAs the main site for detoxification of substances from the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is vulnerable to damage. The gall bladder not only stores bile but also absorbs water from it and, as a result, the bile becomes more concentrated and more powerful at breaking down fats. **RELATED TOPICS**\n\nTHE SMALL INTESTINE\n\nTHE PANCREAS\n\n**3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY**\n\nABRAHAM VATER\n\n**1684–1751**\n\nThe discoverer in 1720 of the ampulla of Vater\n\n**30-SECOND TEXT**\n\nClaire France Smith\n\n**_Bile produced by the gall bladder may crystallize and cause inflammation or blockages that require the organ's removal in a cholecystectomy_. Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. Bile is secreted by the liver to aid in the digestion of fats. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat.The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver.The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder.Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.In humans the caecum is about 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length, but in animals the caecum/appendix can be very long; for example, in horses it can measure up to 1 metre (3 feet 4 inches) and contains enzymes for processing grass-based food.

The metals used were cobalt, nickel, copper, and iron, which proved to have capacities of 700 mA h/g and maintain full capacity for 100 cycles. The materials operate by reduction of the metal cation to either metal nanoparticles or to a lower oxidation state oxide. lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. The cathode comprises particles of sulfur \"redox center\", carbon, and electrolyte. During discharge, the lithium ions plate the cathode with lithium metal and the sulfur is not reduced unless irreversible deep discharge occurs. The thickened cathode is a compact way to store the used lithium. The energy density of is lower than that of lithium cobalt oxide, and also has a lower operating voltage. Therefore, all the cathodes under consideration are actually /C (composite made with carbon).

However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a Kirpan. Three forms of property is presented by the constitution: public, collective and individual property. The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.

In New York state's \"hop belt\" numerous hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Ostego, Chenango, Madison, Oneida, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties were the primary areas contained within the hop belt. As hops production basically dwindled down to only Washington state, in the U.S., the remaining hop houses elsewhere have begun to disappear. The malted barley comes from Great Western Malting in Pocatello, Idaho and their hops come from Washington. **PLANT**\n\nHops are grown from rhizomes, which are a type of root (technically an underground stem) that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a piece of gingerroot.Hops can regulate and balance hormonal activity so may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. Hops are known to cause \"man boobs\" because of their estrogen-like compounds. Common Varieties: Beer lovers may recommend some of these popular varieties: 'Cascade', 'Centennial', 'Willmette', 'Chinook', 'Amarillo', 'Golding', or 'Saaz'. **PLANT**\n\nHops are grown from rhizomes, which are a type of root (technically an underground stem) that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a piece of gingerroot.

Some popular hop varieties used in brewing include 'Cascade', 'Centennial', 'Willmette', 'Chinook', 'Amarillo', 'Golding', and 'Saaz'. Hops possess properties that can regulate and balance hormonal activity, which may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. The vine dies in winter, but the rhizomes (roots) survive, allowing hops to grow on new wood every year. I hope this information provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the common uses and effects of hops, as well as the specifics of their growth and cultivation. Hop growers in the United States employ the use of a wide variety of pesticides in order to protect their crop from numerous forms of disease and predation. Fungicide use is the most common treatment by hop growers, with plants receiving on average 8.3 applications per season. The nonprofit trade group Hop Growers of America is an advocate for Integrated Pest Management practices in hop farming. IPM in hop growing involves using a scientifically informed rotation of pesticides, growing a diverse variety of disease resistant cultivars, and practicing proper planting techniques to ensure minimal environmental and economic impact. Idaho, Oregon, and Washington all have laws preventing importation of hop roots from outside of the Pacific Northwest in order to prevent the spread of disease and pests.\n\nQuestion: where do they grow hops in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Jerry is a brown mute anthropomorphic house mouse, who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short Puss Gets the Boot. Hanna gave the mouse's original name as \"Jinx\", while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance. Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bowtie and a kinder disposition in Tom & Jerry Kids. The first Tom and Jerry short/film that Jerry was in is Puss Gets the Boot, and the last is The Karate Guard, the 163rd Tom and Jerry film. In 2001, a new television special titled Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not \"blame everything on the mouse\". Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry.\n\nQuestion: what 's the dog 's name on tom and jerry\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Recently discovered oil reserves have increased the importance of the commodity on African economies. Sudan and Nigeria are two of the main oil producers. Oil is provided by both continental and offshore productions. Five countries dominate Africa's upstream oil production. Together they account for 85% of the continent's oil production and are, in order, from highest to lowest output: Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Angola. Other African oil producing countries are Gabon, the DRC, Cameroon, Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, and more recently, Ghana. Included in this list are Chad, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, and Madagascar, whilst Mozambique and Tanzania are potential oil producers.

Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical, nucleation bead. Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, which, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters, whereas Tahiti is the number one cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters. Pearling in Bangladesh has existed for centuries. Bangladesh is famous for natural pink pearls, locally known as “mukta”. The port city of Chittagong is a historic center of the pearl trade. Bangladeshi pearl production is small compared to other major producers. pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.

In turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the Sufi mystic's quest for divine love, so that Ibn Arabi, for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the divine names and attributes. Other well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include:\n\n to Mary as the Mother of Jesus. In modern Catholic thought, the rose window is often associated with the Virgin Mary because one of her titles, referred to by St Bernard of Clairvaux, is the \"Mystical Rose\". In William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose\" the rose is a symbol for love or passion, it is crimson and dark but now sick, the worm has infected it. The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem \"Romance of the Rose\" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose for Emily\" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa. In a postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco discusses the reason behind the title to his 1983 novel: \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".\n\nQuestion: who is rose in the fall season 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But in the reverse ratio to mine. In her, the mother instinct was so powerful that she poured it out, indiscriminately almost, on everyone she knew. She mothers her own mother.

Margaret was planning to spend spring vacation in Florida with Sylvia, but her cradle-to-grave Christian maternal grandparents, Mary and Paul Hutchins, who have been estranged from her mother for 14 years due to their disapproval of the interfaith marriage, suddenly decide to visit the day after Margaret leaves for Florida. Margaret's mother has her cancel her vacation, saying it's not the end of the world and she'll go to Florida another time.

The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches.\" Just as I was rising to go home, she turned suddenly upon me, and said: ' Mrs. Brown, why do you come up at evening so near our house, and then go back without coming in?

She comes from a long family history of breast cancer with both her mother and older sister having been similarly diagnosed. She talks about the importance of getting second opinions and how that convinced her to have a lumpectomy followed by radiation versus a double mastectomy. Meg was lucky to have a strong network of friends and family that helped her through her journey. She now works for the Cancer Support Community to aid those less fortunate. Dr Williamson talks about why her medical career became focused on breast cancer following the loss of her sister to the disease. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's. My sister had breast cancer in her early 40's so I was a teenager when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. My parents didn't tell me and she had breast cancer. They told me that afternoon she had a single mastectomy. A year later she had a second mastectomy because the doctors back then said chances are if she had it on one side she's going to have it on the other so we're going to go and take the second one. And then a year later she had a hysterectomy and unfortunately for my mom she never really recovered from it all. But she was cancer-free for four or five years and then she had spinal cancer after that. It had a huge impact on her emotionally, severe depression, and a really hard thing because none of us understood what was going on with her. None of us understood it. We thought once the cancer is over you should be fine but she had a really hard time coming out of it, never really did. I have a mammogram every six months and then I have a sonocine on the other six months and I've never missed an appointment and I never will. I was told that my survival rates would be the same. I had a long phone conversation or lunch or dinner with every single one I had known who had it and what did they do; how did they make their choice; how did they make the decision; and I had a very good friend who had been diagnosed with the same kind of cancer I had just six months earlier, and she did the lumpectomy and radiation. That made perfect sense to me. My husband was with me every step of the way. And then they lay you down on the bed and then the radiation starts and it doesn't hurt. And I was pretty good leading up to the start of radiation in terms of emotion. She said, I didn't think you'd do well with this, and she was right. My doctors were wonderful. Every doctor was amazing. And every doctor had time for me. They all gave me their cell phones…you call me anytime you have a question. These doctors were all…everyone was amazing. I was told the horses hadn't left the barn yet. After the pathology report came in and it turns out that the barn doors had actually opened, that the horses would have started to leave the barn had I waited much longer for the surgery, so knowing that I just felt so grateful that I was checked every six months and we acted on it right away. And because the horses had left the barn, I am on medication for five years. After I went through radiation, I did choose to have a hysterectomy because there were other signs happening. When they were giving me biopsies…my gynecologist was giving me biopsies..I thought I don't ever want to hear the word biopsy again, and when my gynecologist said if you get ovarian cancer there's nothing I can do for you, I said.. that's all he had to say to me is I said then let's do it. He didn't understand what was going on, and we didn't do a very good job explaining to him. It was really awful for him. They're very fatalistic about this for them with their grandmother, their aunt, their mother, which is the same way I felt about cancer. That it was a matter of time. And so, no, my mother did not have the support system that Cancer Support provides and she could have really used Cancer Support Community. She would have loved Cancer Support Community. She could have really used it. I love Cancer Support Community so much because we believe that nobody should face cancer alone, and I was blessed to have this incredible support system but not everybody has that great support system and you can't go through something like this alone; you can't do it; it's too hard.\n\nQuestion: who turned out to be the mother on how i met your mother\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

With effect from 1 January 2011, a new rate of 10% will apply to all companies except energy and utility providers, which will pay a 10% surcharge and thus incur a rate of 20%. Many tax incentives simply remove part or of the burden of the tax from business transactions. In Malaysia, the corporate tax rate is now capped at 25%. Nevertheless, a company eligible for a certain tax incentive might only pay an average effective tax rate of 7.5%, with only 30% of the company's profit being subjected to tax. There are a number of tax incentives given to entrepreneurs to encourage business growth and development. Therefore, many businesses have taken advantage of the various tax incentives available for their benefit. Good knowledge of these tax incentives has provided them ideas to effectively plan their business and investment strategies. As such companies have to seek expert opinions on all available tax incentives before they make their move to invest, because the incentives vary according to the business' structure.

The Divergent Series: Allegiant (simply known as Allegiant) is a 2016 American dystopian science fiction action film directed by Robert Schwentke with a screenplay by Bill Collage, Adam Cooper, and Noah Oppenheim, and the third and final part in The Divergent Series. It was set to be the first of two cinematic parts based on the final novel of the Divergent trilogy by Veronica Roth (the second part was to be Ascendant). The film stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Zoë Kravitz, Maggie Q, Ray Stevenson, Bill Skarsgård, Octavia Spencer, and Naomi Watts. Divergent was released on March 21, 2014, in the United States. The film received mixed reviews: although its action sequences and performances, notably Woodley's, were praised, critics deemed its execution and handling of its themes to be generic and unoriginal, and compared it unfavorably to other young adult fiction adaptations. A sequel, Insurgent, was released on March 20, 2015, in the United States and other countries. A third film, Allegiant, was released on March 18, 2016.\n\nQuestion: when is the fourth movie of the divergent series coming out\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Such a title has no historical precedent; under English common law, wives of kings automatically become queens. The Guardian reported in 2017 that experts expect \"the fiction will end when Elizabeth II dies\" and Camilla will be queen. Born into the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Sibylla was the daughter of Charles Edward, the last duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was the eldest but estranged son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach, and the father of King George III. Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother, paternal grandfather and father. He moved to Great Britain following the accession of his father, and was created Prince of Wales. Also at the start of her widowhood, the Queen Mother purchased the Castle of Mey in Scotland as a summer residence. Since 2002 (upon the death of The Queen Mother), Clarence House has been the London residence of Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Until their marriages in 2011 and 2018, respectively, it was the London residence of Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nQuestion: who will take the throne after the queen dies\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These hotels may be referred to as major conference center hotels, flagship hotels, destination hotels, and destination resorts. These hotels as destinations may be characterized by distinctive architecture, upscale lodgings, ballrooms, large conference facilities, restaurants, and recreation activities such as golf or skiing. Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars. Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels. Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization. In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes. The hotel is a member of both The Leading Hotels of the World and Imperial Hotel, Ltd., marketing and trade associations geared toward luxury hotels. The hotel is currently owned and operated by the Japanese company Mitsui Fudosan. The hotel's boutique sister property, Waikiki Parc, is located across the street.

First, as the sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, leading to the release of acrosomal enzymes. During this process, the heads of several sperm fuse with the zona pellucida. However, only one successful sperm will be able to penetrate the egg. This fusion of the sperm with the zona pellucida is known as the acrosome reaction, marking the completion of capacitation. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary changes in the sperm's plasma membrane, enabling the release of acrosomal enzymes. Upon penetration, the sperm sheds its body and tail, with only the head containing the genetic material entering the egg. ### **How Fertilization Occurs**\n\nThe process whereby sperm are prepared to fertilize an egg, which is known as _capacitation_ , takes place in two stages. First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. )The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg.Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation. The oviduct, also known as the fallopian tube, is the site where fertilization typically takes place. Along this journey, if fertilization occurs, it usually happens within the ampulla or the widest part of the oviduct. The sperm's journey towards the egg is facilitated by several factors such as the release of cervical mucus that allows sperm to swim more easily and the contraction of the fallopian tube muscles, which help move the sperm towards the egg. This usually happens through a process known as the acrosome reaction, where enzymes released by the sperm help break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg. This is an essential step for successful fertilization since only mature eggs can be fertilized by sperm. Once fertilization occurs, the genetic material of the sperm combines with the genetic material of the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The oviduct provides the necessary environment for the sperm and egg to meet, allowing for the formation of a zygote and the beginning of pregnancy. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes.

It is a thin, highly vascularized, and pigmented layer that lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid supplies blood to the retina and helps nourish its cells with oxygen and nutrients. Lastly, there is the iris, which is the most anterior portion of the vascular layer. The iris also helps in protecting the internal structures of the eye. Overall, the components of the vascular layer of the eyeball work together to provide nourishment to the retina, regulate the amount of light entering the eye, facilitate accommodation for near vision, and maintain intraocular pressure. Vascular layer of the eyeball\\n\\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball consists of three continuous parts—the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris from posterior to anterior (Fig. It is a thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer consisting of smaller vessels adjacent to the retina and larger vessels more peripherally. Its components include the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes.\" The outer layer, called the corneoscleral coat or fibrous layer, consists of the sclera and cornea. The cornea, which is transparent, covers the anterior one-sixth of the eye and is continuous with the sclera. Moving inward, the middle layer is known as the vascular coat or uvea. The choroid is a highly vascular layer that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body, located behind the iris, is responsible for producing the aqueous humor and controlling the shape of the lens. The innermost layer is called the retina. It consists of the outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. In summary, the three concentric layers of the eye include the corneoscleral coat (consisting of the sclera and cornea), the vascular coat or uvea (composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris), and the retina (comprised of the outer pigment epithelium, inner neural retina, and ciliary body/iris epithelium). Reference:\n- The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats. The eyeball is composed of three structural layers: the corneoscleral coat, the outer or fibrous layer, the vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, and the retina, the inner layer. The external layer of the eyeball is composed of the sclera, which is the opaque tissue making up the \"white\" of the eye, and the transparent cornea located on the front of the eye. The sclera provides structural support and protection to the eyeball, while the cornea helps focus incoming light onto the retina. It contains many blood vessels that supply nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris and plays a role in secreting aqueous humor, which helps maintain the shape of the eye. The innermost layer of the eyeball is the retina. The retina also contains blood vessels and plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information to the optic nerve. The cornea is transparent and located at the front of the eye. The sclera, which is dull white in color, protects the internal structures of the eye and maintains the eye's shape. It consists of three parts: the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. The retina is the innermost layer of the eyeball. The wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric layers. Moving inward, the middle layer is called the vascular coat or uvea.

De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on 24 February 1895, but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until 11 April 1895. His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero. With only forty men in his force, they were quickly defeated by Spanish troops. His armed revolt had failed miserably, but as historian Cento Gomez stated, \"it was a ground breaking event in the history of Cuban struggle for independence.\" On August 12, 1851, he was shot by a firing squad of Spanish troops alongside three of his compatriots in Puerto Príncipe (today’s Camagüey province). Years later Cuba did achieve independence from Spanish rule, and to honor Agüero's dedication to the Cuban cause of freedom, after the conclusion of the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898), several public places and buildings were named after him. After his second deportation to Spain in 1878, the pro-independence Cuban activist José Martí moved to the United States in 1881, where he began mobilizing the support of the Cuban exile community in Florida, especially in Ybor City in Tampa and Key West. He sought a revolution and Cuban independence from Spain, but also lobbied to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American and Cuban politicians desired. After deliberations with patriotic clubs across the United States, the Antilles and Latin America, the Partido Revolucionario Cubano (Cuban Revolutionary Party) was officially proclaimed on 10 April 1892, with the \n\n By 1868, many countries in Latin America had obtained independence from Spain.

These markings, also known as \"tool marks,\" are created during the manufacturing process and can provide valuable information for forensic investigations and crime scene analysis. Primary markings are intentional, distinctive characteristics that are intentionally engraved or stamped onto a bullet during the manufacturing process. These markings can include the manufacturer's logo, brand name, or specific design features unique to a particular manufacturer. Primary markings help identify the firearm that fired the bullet and can narrow down the list of possible weapons used in a crime. These markings can include scratches, pits, or imperfections caused by the firearm's chamber, breech face, or extractor. By analyzing primary and secondary markings on a bullet, forensic experts can determine important information such as the make and model of the firearm used, its potential history, and potentially link it to a specific crime. Overall, primary and secondary markings on metal bullets play a crucial role in the identification of weapons, aiding in criminal investigations, and supporting the justice system. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel. This process, known as bullet matching or ballistics comparison, involves examining the striations, scratches, and grooves on the bullet's surface. Primary markings are the initial impressions left by the gun barrel, such as the rifling pattern and the number of lands and grooves. By examining and matching the primary and secondary markings on a metal bullet, investigators can potentially link the bullet to a specific firearm. It is important to note that while bullet matching is valuable in forensic investigations, it is not a foolproof method. The Trace Metal Detection Test (TMDT) or Technique was developed during the Vietnam War in the 1960s to identify people who may have been carrying firearms against their skin. A 0.2% solution of 8-hydroxyquinoline in isopropanol sprayed on the skin and illuminated with shortwave ultraviolet (UV) light after several minutes reveals a pattern and type of metal based on trace amounts of metal transferred to the skin that are invisible under normal lighting. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel. This process, known as bullet matching or ballistics comparison, involves examining the striations, scratches, and grooves on the bullet's surface. Primary markings are the initial impressions left by the gun barrel, such as the rifling pattern and the number of lands and grooves. By examining and matching the primary and secondary markings on a metal bullet, investigators can potentially link the bullet to a specific firearm. It is important to note that while bullet matching is valuable in forensic investigations, it is not a foolproof method. Often such information (normally ranging marks) was etched onto equipment such as stiletto daggers or shovels. In 1782, the discovery was made by John Senebier that certain resins lost their solubility to turpentine when exposed to light; that is, they hardened.\n\nQuestion: when was the first documented case of tool mark identification\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From Viking times, duvets of eider down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over Europe began buying and using such duvets. In the 17th century, Paul Rycaut was among the first to try and market the duvet in England. In the story The Princess and the Pea, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on 10 eiderdown duvets. In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise: \"There is one thing very particular to them, that they do not cover themselves with bed-clothes, but lay one feather-bed over, and another under. The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in, evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment.

Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. They have their roots in the hospital industry, which long ago discovered the many advantages of adjustable beds. It was not until the 1960's that these devices became popular for the general consumer, and since the price has dropped while the quality has risen. There are many medicinal advantages that are associated with adjustable beds. This is where the advantage of owning an adjustable bed comes in. It is also much more ergonomic and practical to eat in bed with an adjustable bed. Whether you are purchasing your adjustable bed for one of the many of the medical reasons, to get a better nights rest, or for any of the other advantages associated with them, you will be amazed at the luxurious feelings associated with these beds. 1980.006] Steel indoor and outdoor furniture has been popular in this country since the '20s. Around 1925, Marcel Breuer, the Bauhaus furniture designer and architect, began working with tubular steel, having been impressed with the light weight and strength of the handlebars of a bicycle.

John's song won both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song as well as the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The track also reached the top spot on the Hot R&B Singles listing, and was one of two of 1994's AC number ones to also top Billboards all-genre chart, the Hot 100, the other being Celine Dion's cover version of Jennifer Rush's 1984 song \"The Power of Love\". First worked on as a demo, Jackson co-produced the song during a 1983 recording session with Anka. In 1984, Anka sent the song to Johnny Mathis, who recorded a new version of the song with revised lyrics by Anka and Kathleen Wakefield. In 2006, Jackson's demo leaked online. The first version, which only features Jackson, was produced by John McClain and Giorgio Tuinfort and was featured as the first track on the standard version of Xscape. The second version, featured as the last track on the deluxe version of the album, was co-produced by Timbaland and J-Roc and featured Timberlake in duet vocals with Jackson. While producing Timberlake's duet version, Timberlake sampled the percussion and breaths from Jackson's 1979 song \"Workin' Day and Night\". \"Love of the Loved\" is a song written mainly by Paul McCartney, credited to Lennon–McCartney.

The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists, and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the \n\n of the organisms named inside of it. In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published. In this book, he described his theory of evolution by natural selection. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. The article also includes an Abstract of a Letter from Darwin to Asa Gray, and an introductory letter by Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell. This was published in November 1859 as On the Origin of Species.\n\nQuestion: who wrote the book the origin of species\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in Forest Grove, Oregon. The Department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound. The news about the noise was first shared with Dave Nemeyer by a Forest Grove resident, who posted a video of it on the city's Facebook page. The Washington Post described the noise as sounding like a \"giant flute played off pitch\", car brakes, or a steam whistle. NBC News described it as \"akin to a bad one-note violin solo broadcast over a microphone with nonstop feedback\". [...] It was a very controversial method of recording, because when you have that many spaced omnidirectional microphones you lose a lot of the directional cues, which is absolutely right, the way that we would deal with that was we would pan the left and right tree half left and half right, and the outrigger mics we would pan hard left and \n\nAt Medpark Hearing Center, we talk about treating your hearing as part of a larger system. Sometimes, just answering a few questions can help get the wheels turning, and highlight a few areas that might point to hearing loss. Is it difficult to understand one person's speech while there is background noise? 4. Do you find it difficult to understand the dialogue on TV unless you turn the volume up high? 5. Do you often need to ask others to repeat themselves? It's like trying to run with three or four feet of water; obviously, your legs are not going to be able to move as fast. With ears, it's the same thing: if the ossicles in the middle ear are under water, they will not be able to conduct high frequency sound as efficiently. That's why everything sounds muffled when you have a cold. It means that the nerves in the inner ear have suffered actual damage, which could be caused by aging, ear infections, or prolonged exposure to loud noise. But we can treat it, and the sooner we treat it, the better. What does the brain have to do with the hearing system? Your brain is responsible for interpreting sound, and just like the rest of your hearing system, your brain can be involved in hearing loss. Think about it this way: you can hear a foreign language spoken out loud, but if your brain doesn't understand that language, it will sound like noise to you. Understanding is the brain is part of the hearing system. If you go too long without being able to hear the world around you (due to conductive or sensorineural hearing loss), your brain may stop putting as much effort into understanding what you hear. If it gets out of the habit, then even hearing aids won't solve your ability to understand what people around you are saying. That's why it is so important to get hearing loss treated early, so your brain still retains all of its skill at understanding and interpreting sounds. What are realistic expectations of hearing treatment? But it's also important that you understand what to expect. For some people, the answer is an old-fashioned device that is beige, bulky, and prone to squealing. In fact, it's a lot more likely that people you speak with will notice if you ask them to repeat themselves all the time. But it's important to stay on top of your hearing and address any problems as soon as you notice them to keep your brain healthy and give you peace-of-mind. If you have noticed that you're turning the volume of the TV up, if you're having to ask people to repeat themselves more often, if it seems like everyone around you is mumbling, it might be time to come have your hearing tested. maybe 2.5 feet back and 5 feet apart you would have 2 more forming a triangle, omnidirectional microphones.

The major modern representatives of the family are Finnish and Estonian, the official languages of their respective nation states. The other Finnic languages in the Baltic Sea region are Ingrian and Votic, spoken in Ingria by the Gulf of Finland; and Livonian, once spoken around the Gulf of Riga.

Azerbaijani is a member of Oghuz branch of Turkic language, and it is closely related to Turkish and Turkmeni. It is known to speakers as Turki. Unlike the languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group.

Menstrual pads are placed on panties to collect the menstrual fluid outside of the body. Menstrual cups are soft cups usually made of medical-grade silicone and are shaped like a bell. Menstrual cups can be emptied, rinsed, and reinserted. If there are concerns or questions about menstrual products or menstrual health, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider for guidance and support. If a woman does not have menstrual pads available while menstruating, there are several alternatives she can consider. Although it may not provide the same level of absorbency and protection as menstrual pads, it can help manage the flow until more suitable products become available. In addition, some women may choose to use period underwear or menstrual cups as alternatives to traditional menstrual pads. Period underwear is specially designed with built-in absorbent layers to prevent leaks, while menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood. Reference:\n- Menstrual pads: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_pad\n\n Menstrual products are part of menstrual culture, as they are prominent in shops, through advertising and through disposal methods (such as sanitary bins and bags). There are environmental costs of using menstruation products containing plastic and chemicals. Not all cultures use menstrual products, opting instead for natural materials or homemade options. Cloth menstrual pads are reusable pads made from layers of absorbent fabrics, such as cotton or hemp, that are worn in the underwear to collect menstrual fluid. Compared to disposable sanitary napkins, cloth menstrual pads have a few advantages. In comparison to menstrual cups, cloth pads offer a different level of convenience and comfort. Menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina and collect blood internally, while cloth pads sit on the outside of the underwear and absorb blood externally. Some individuals may find cloth pads more comfortable or easier to use than inserting a cup. It is important to note that both cloth menstrual pads and disposable sanitary napkins require regular changing throughout the day to maintain hygiene and prevent leaks. Overall, choosing between cloth menstrual pads, disposable sanitary napkins, or menstrual cups is a personal preference based on factors such as cost, environmental impact, comfort, and ease of use.\n\nQuestion: what is the point of a menstrual cup\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Over time, especially after reports of atrocities \n\n When World War I broke out in Europe during the summer of 1914, the United States stuck to a strict policy of neutrality. On August 4, 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared to Congress that, \"The United States must be neutral in fact, as well as in name, during these days that are to try men's souls. This helped overcome Wilson's reluctance to having the US fight alongside a country ruled by an absolutist monarch. Congress declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various small co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers. On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary. The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, nearly three years after World War I started. Before entering the war, the U.S. had remained neutral, though it had been an important supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and the other powers of the Allies of World War I. American soldiers under General of the Armies John Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), arrived at the rate of 10,000 men a day on the Western Front in the summer of 1918.\n\nQuestion: when did united states enter world war i\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. According to \n\n Classical economist David Ricardo embraced Say's Law, suggesting, in Keynes's formulation, that \"supply creates its own demand\". Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that \n\n Factor price equalization is an economic theory, by Paul A. Samuelson (1948), which states that the prices of identical factors of production, such as the wage rate or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in commodities. A simple summary of this theory is when the prices of the output \n\n creates its own supply\" and developing a comprehensive theory of effective demand. According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial \"boom\". Mises stated that this artificial \"boom\" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called \"malinvestment\" - which eventually must end in a \"bust\". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment\n\nQuestion: who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. Vodka, gin, baijiu, shōchū, soju, tequila, whiskey, brandy and rum are examples of distilled drinks.

List of gin brands ; List of liqueurs ; List of rum producers ; List of tequilas ; List of vodkas ; List of whisky brands – also known as liquor and spirits, a distilled drink is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of a mixture produced from alcoholic fermentation, such as wine. Spirits are distilled beverages that contain no added sugar and have at least 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). Popular spirits include borovička, brandy, gin, rum, slivovitz, tequila, vodka, and whisky. By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850.\n\nQuestion: where did the term spirits for alcohol come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There are four methods in which the LD50 test is measured: Subcutaneous : Venom is injected into the fatty layer beneath the skin. The most commonly tested methods are subcutaneous and intravenous injections of mice. Subcutaneous is the most applicable to actual bites. What Is a Subcutaneous Injection? A subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin. In this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. This type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. Other methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body. Medications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously. Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. If you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen. Dial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer. Dial the correct dose and prepare for your injection. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier. Inject the needle. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin. Insert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication. Withdraw the needle. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row. For example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage. What Is a Drug Allergy?

This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise.

This movement is facilitated by peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions to propel the food throughout the GI tract. Here, further digestion takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes, bile from the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine itself. These enzymes break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The small intestine is where most absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to various organs and tissues for energy and other functions. In summary, digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract involve the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and elimination of waste in the large intestine. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less \n\nCongenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\n The digestive system comprises a foregut, a midgut and a hindgut, and is situated dorsally. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus. When food is ingested, it enters the digestive system where it is broken down into simpler particles through the process of digestion. The partially digested food, known as the bolus, then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. From the stomach, the chyme moves into the small intestine. It is responsible for breaking down food into its simplest forms, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. The nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream to various cells and tissues in the body for energy production and other functions. It is important to note that the absorption of digested food material occurs primarily in the small intestine, whereas the large intestine is involved in water reabsorption. The structures and organs involved in the digestive process, such as the stomach, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, each have specific roles in breaking down and absorbing food. Overall, the human body's ability to break down and absorb food is a complex process involving various organs, enzymes, and physiological mechanisms to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients for optimal function.\n\nQuestion: where are most nutrients absorbed in the human digestive tract\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph. Additionally, every n-vertex strongly connected directed graph in which each vertex has degree at least n (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite directed graph. A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet.\n\nQuestion: an edge that is between a vertex and itself is a\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

My Fabulous Gay Wedding is a Canadian reality show hosted by comedian Scott Thompson in the first season and Elvira Kurt in the second. The series airs on the Global Television Network. It is re-broadcast in the U.S. as First Comes Love, on Logo. In the first season, the show features a same-sex couple that plans to marry; the arrangements for the wedding are prepared, on two weeks' notice, by a team of wedding planners who are both heterosexual and homosexual. In the second season, with new host Elvira Kurt, the stories concentrate more on the couples than the wedding planning process. The team of wedding planners has been reduced to one: Fern Cohen. Through interviews with the family members, the show also explores the issue of same-sex marriage and its effect on the social fabric. Little America looks to \"go beyond the headlines to look at the funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring and unexpected lives of immigrants in America, at a time when their stories are more relevant than ever.\" However, when the series was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season, Schooley and McCorkle were forced to confronted the challenge of writing for Kim and Ron as a couple for the first time but eventually grew to appreciate their \"new dynamic\", which provided the show with \"new life\" while allowing the writers to explore previously uncharted comedic territory.\n\nQuestion: when does the little couples new season start\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages. In Belgium, the justices of the peace (vredegerecht, justice de paix, friedensgericht) function as the small claims courts in the country's judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote Aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate. In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court).\n\nQuestion: what is the job of justice of the peace\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ceremonies were presided over by Bob Hope, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., and Frank Sinatra. The success of The Godfather Part II was notable; it received twice as many Oscars as its predecessor (six) and duplicated its feat of three Best Supporting Actor nominations (as of the 93rd Academy Awards, the last film to receive three nominations in a single acting category). Between the two of them, father and son Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola won four awards, with Carmine winning for Best Original Dramatic Score (with Nino Rota) and Francis for Picture, Director, and Best Screenplay Adapted from Other Material (with Mario Puzo). The 8th Academy Awards were held on March 5, 1936, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California. This was the first year in which the gold statuettes were called \"Oscars\". This was the second and last year that write-in votes were allowed at the Oscars. The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. The ceremonies were presided over by Johnny Carson.

Trainers Darren McDonald, Graeme Bate and Jason Thompson have each won the Melbourne Cup on three occasions. Prior to the Cup, Viewed won the AJC Listed Japan Racing Association (JRA) Plate on 30 April 2008 and two months later he qualified by winning the Group 2 Brisbane Cup on 9 June 2008. In the 2008 Melbourne Cup on 4 November, Viewed defeated the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer in a photo finish. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed's Melbourne Cup was the 250th Group 1 training victory for Bart Cummings. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales. The popular Bart Cummings trained mare Leilani was the favourite for the 1974 Melbourne Cup but she was run down in the last fifty metres by her stablemate Think Big under jockey Harry White. Following his second last in the lead up MacKinnon Stakes, Think Big started at 33–1 in the 1975 Melbourne Cup, assigned high-weight of 58 kg. But at his favourite course and distance, again under jockey Harry White, he fought off a challenge from stablemate Holiday Waggon to record his second win.

Ohio (1961). In the Supreme Court case, Mapp v. Ohio, the decision was made in favor of Mapp, in a 6-3 ruling. As a result of the ruling in Mapp v. Ohio, Mapp's conviction was voided. A few years after Mapp v. Ohio was ruled upon, Mapp was convicted again, but this time for the possession of narcotics. In Mapp v. Ohio the Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional to use the evidence of pornography gathered from the police officers when they illegally searched Mapp's house. This realization of the Court is what allowed Dollree Mapp and her lawyer to make a \"motion to suppress\" the evidence. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. However, when the argument was altered to focus on the Fourth Amendment by Justice Clark, only 5 justices decided that the evidence taken from Mapp's home, without a search warrant, was \"illegally obtained.\" As a result of the Mapp opinion, the Supreme Court extended the obtainment of illegal evidence rule to the states. The officer found evidence of pornography in Mapp's house. As a result, Mapp was \"charged under an Ohio law that made possession of obscene material a felony.\" Mapp was sentenced with 7 years in prison.\n\nQuestion: who was involved in the mapp vs ohio case\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its name comes from its resemblance to the letter T. T-squares come in varying sizes, common lengths being 18 inch, 24 inch, 30 inch, 36 inch and 42 inch. He got the idea of using it from seeing it was being used to indicate the end of articles in magazines. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.\" The character (visarga) in the Tamil script represents the āytam, a special sound of the Tamil language. An asterism,, is a typographic symbol consisting of three asterisks placed in a triangle. Its purpose is to \"indicate minor breaks in text\", to call attention to a passage, or to separate sub-chapters in a book. The graphically identical sign serves as a Japanese map symbol on the maps of the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan, indicating a tea plantation.

It was the 116th edition of the World Series, a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). Following their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects. It was played at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. After advancing, they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.

More than 200 Winship patients participate in the Phase I Clinical Trials Unit directed by Donald Harvey. That’s good news for patients like Quincy Washington, who was 42 when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2007. Cathy Mooney didn’t need a wake-up call. In 2002, at 48 years old, “I felt like I was at the top of my game,” she says. After a frustrating three months, Mooney heard two words she never knew before: multiple myeloma. “We were devastated. I felt wonderful; I did not feel sick.” Mooney received an advise to travel from her home in Thomasville, Georgia, to Little Rock, Arkansas. In 2008, Mooney and her husband flew north to visit myeloma specialists at Sloan Kettering and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The latter was Ken Anderson, who had been following Lonial’s progress at Winship. Both told Mooney that she could get the best, most current treatment in her home state of Georgia. Her five grandchildren are a constant delight. Seven years ago, Tamara Mobley was so busy, active, and energetic that if she were a cartoon, she’d be a blur. The dedicated mother of two young boys, a loving wife and a full-time employee in a good job, she didn’t get much downtime. Then Mobley, who was 33, got tired. For a young, vibrant, working wife and mother that was terrifying. Mobley was so ill that she got to Emory University Hospital in an ambulance. For one thing, it’s rare. “There’s no other story like that in cancer,” says Sagar Lonial, Winship’s chief medical officer and chair of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology in the School of Medicine. But the cancerous cells also secrete protein and, like normal cells, they’re engineered to do this in a particular way—the protein assembled and folded just so. Learn more about Tamara’s story here. When Eric Berry first learned he had a type of blood cancer known as Hodgkin lymphoma, the Kansas City Chiefs football player returned to his home and family in Georgia and sought treatment at Winship Cancer Institute. During that time, nurse Stephanie Jones took care of Berry and got to know both him and his family. It turned out that nurse Stephanie made quite a lasting impression on Berry. At the end of July, he returned to Kansas City to resume practices with his team and during his first press conference, he gave a shout-out to Jones and credited her as being the “real MVP” of his treatment. Jones says she’s proud of the honor and admiring of Berry’s determination to beat the cancer. As Stephanie shows, our Winship compassion is what is remembered. See Eric Berry and Stephanie’s story on KCTV-TV Kansas City. To celebrate the journey and one year of remission, my family and I planned a trip to England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. We were so excited to celebrate! We planned to leave on a Sunday in June, and I had one more appointment on the Friday before we left. Absolutely devastated, we decided to postpone the trip and start treatment right away instead. It was so incredible to be able to talk with the man who saved my life! My family and I decided to re-schedule the trip we had postponed for summer 2012, and we couldn’t wait to finally go – we had so much more to celebrate! That trip was symbolic of God’s healing and grace, and it became even more significant when Johannes and his dad agreed to meet us in London to spend a few days together. It was an experience of a lifetime! There I was, sitting in a London pub, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the man who gave me the gift of life. It was so amazing to spend a few days exploring London with Johannes and his dad Bernd. What an incredible gift! Fast forward three years, a dozen Skype sessions, tons of emails, and countless postcards – Johannes surprised me with the news that he and his girlfriend Tina were coming to Georgia to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of my transplant — I call it my transplantiversary. They arrived on Aug. 15 and we spent the weekend camping out at Lake Lanier with friends and family. I loved every minute of it! We also took Johannes and Tina to tour Winship and meet some of my doctors and practitioners, which was an amazing experience. What a beautiful experience! I will forever be connected to Johannes and his family, and it is all because he joined the bone marrow registry in Germany. My prayer and my hope is that others will be inspired to join the registry as well – there are so many people who need this life-saving gift, and you could be the match for them!

Tamara Mobley, 38 and married with 8 and 12 year old sons, has been battling multiple myeloma for five years now under the care of Dr. Sagar Lonial at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. In the video below, Fox 5 Atlanta talked to Tamara and Dr. Lonial about the decision to participate in a clinical trial. A cancer diagnosis always comes as a shock, but it’s particularly unexpected at that age. I was treated here at Winship, by Dr. Toncred Styblo and Dr. David Lawson. Twenty-five years later, all three of us are still here. I took a job as supervisor of business operations for the Glenn Family Breast Center at Winship, and I am one of the organizers of the Celebration of Living event coming up this Sat., June 21. That’s why the Celebration of Living event is so near and dear to my heart. This is a chance to get together with other survivors, and discover that part of being a survivor is learning that it’s ok to let fun and humor back into your life. We all know that battling cancer has very dark moments, but I hope we can bring some hope and lightness into your life. So I invite all cancer survivors, their family members and friends to come share this special day. My hope is that one day, all cancer patients will enjoy a lifetime of survivorship. Mary Brookhart grew up in Ohio before moving to Georgia to get away from the snow. In 2008, looking for something more rewarding, Mary returned to Winship, this time, not as a patient, but as supervisor of business operations for the Emory Glenn Family Breast Center. She currently lives in rural Conyers, with her husband of 37 years, and their three horses. Through the generosity of donations of any size, as well as fundraising events like the Winship Win the Fight 5K, the physicians, staff and researchers at Winship are working harder than ever to achieve that goal for the residents of Georgia and beyond. Forty-one-year-old Nadezhda Petrukhina (Maya Bulgakova), a once heroic World War II Soviet fighter pilot, is now living a quiet, but disappointingly ordinary life as a school principal at a construction-oriented trade school.

From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. Today, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite. Low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, even though it never contained the element lead. Musgrave helped to pave the way for advertising pencils, and that became a large part of Musgrave’s operation. During \n\n A graphite pencil, also called a lead pencil, is a type of pencil in which a thin graphite core is embedded in a shell of other material. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s.\n\nQuestion: when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Comparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. One key distinction between these cell types lies in their cellular organization. Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus, which houses the majority of their genetic material. This nucleus is delimited by a nuclear envelope that separates the DNA from the cytoplasm. In contrast, prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, and their genetic material is present as a single, circular DNA molecule located in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genomes consist of multiple linear DNA molecules and are associated with histone proteins, which aid in packaging and organizing the DNA. This contrast with prokaryotic genomes, which typically consist of a single circular DNA molecule and contain predominantly protein-coding genes. They possess membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, which enable various specialized functions. Eukaryotic cells are larger, more complex, and possess a membrane-bound nucleus and multiple linear DNA molecules. Their genomes are more extensive, containing both protein-coding and RNA genes. **DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits. **cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane. **cell** Smallest unit of an organism, typically but not always consisting of a nucleus and cytoplasm encircled by a membrane. Centrioles play a key role in cell division. **cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane. **DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits. DNA is found in the cells of all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. **gene** Unit of heredity, located on a chromosome.Genes consist of DNA, except in some viruses where they are made of RNA.

When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required. By binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function. In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis.\n\nQuestion: which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the Whigs disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant. The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain. The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president. It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party. Since the 1860s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party. Before 1860, the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the Bank of the United States as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up industry at the expense of the farmers. The Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the supremacy of Congress over the executive branch as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. The early 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.\n\nQuestion: what caused the breakup of the democratic republican party\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Country artist Anne Murray (who'd taken her recording of another Loggins & Messina recording, \"Danny's Song\", to the top-ten in late 1972) covered the song later that year for her album of the same name. Released in December 1973, Murray's version became a major crossover hit early in 1974. In her native Canada, it topped all three singles charts: the overall Top Singles chart, the Country Tracks chart and the Adult Contemporary chart. When Madonna had started working on her third studio album, True Blue in 1985, she was already in a relationship with actor Sean Penn whom she married by the year-end. Her optimism assimilated in the songs created, including the title track, which she co-wrote and co-produced the song with Stephen Bray. According to Madonna, \"True Blue\" takes its title from a favorite expression of Penn and to his very pure vision of love. The song and the album was Madonna's \"unabashed valentine\" for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, \"She [Madonna] was very much in love. In 2015, Madonna said that \"True Blue\" is \"a song about true love. Using songs by Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross and others as inspiration, she attempted to elicit a similar feeling in her own songwriting, claiming, \"Those were just songs that made my heart sing\", she said. Among the songs on the album, \"Baby I Love U!\" Yeah, I’m gonna love you like the woman I love,\" he sings. Lyrically, it acknowledges that any relationship has occasional annoyances, but these aren't enough to prompt Mraz to give up on it. Mraz further explained the track, in a \"track-by-track\" commentary for Billboard: \"I try to keep my music gender neutral, but this is obvious, it's called 'The Woman I Love,' but I'd like to dedicate to the men in the relationships because every so often the woman forgets her own greatness and she goes a little bat sh-- crazy sometimes.\n\nQuestion: who sings the song you 'll never find another love like mine\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The book's title is derived from Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, an anti-slavery novel published in 1852. Harriet Beecher Stowe published the anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, in 1852. Stowe had the intentions of this novel being published when she wrote it; she had taken out a copyright for Uncle Tom's Cabin before it appeared in The National Era. The best-known of these was Josiah Henson, an ex-slave whose autobiography, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself, was originally published in 1849 and later republished in two extensively revised editions after the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Stowe reversed the gender conventions of slave narratives by juxtaposing Uncle Tom's passivity against the daring of three African American women who escape from slavery. The novel was both influential and commercially successful, published as a serial from 1851 to 1852 and as a book from 1852 \n\n A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe.

It involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP. The pyruvate produced from glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it undergoes further processing in the Krebs cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the main pathway for ATP production. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain (ETC). As electrons pass through the ETC, energy is released and used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. These metabolic pathways work in concert to efficiently produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. It occurs in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of transmembrane protein complexes that catalyze redox reactions. As protons move down the electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane protein ATP synthase, ATP is generated from ADP and an inorganic phosphate group. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the \"molecular unit of currency\" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The process is called photophosphorylation.\n\nQuestion: where does the formation of atp take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song samples the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus by Joseph M. Scriven, who wrote it in 1855 to comfort his mother in Iceland while he was living in Canada. On the song, Maher sings about the joy of our friendship with the Saviour. Aleteia described the song as \"switching gears from quiet worship to bouncing folk-rock, with a country-pop hook, where the piece is infused with a jubilant energy, which is aided by a perfectly employed gospel-ish choir.\" Although the lyrics were originally composed, the music and melody of this adaptation resembled the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus, originally written by Joseph M. Scriven as a poem in 1855. He is married to Catherine and has a daughter, Anna, and a son, Joel. Scriven is great-great-grandnephew of Joseph Scriven, Irish poet, best known as the writer of the poem which became the hymn \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\". \"Amazing Grace\" is a Christian hymn published in 1779, with words written in 1772 by the English poet and Anglican clergyman John Newton (1725–1807). Newton wrote the words from personal experience. \"What a Friend\" is a song performed by Canadian contemporary Christian music (CCM) artist Matt Maher. The song was released as the second single from his 2017 album Echoes on September 15, 2017.\n\nQuestion: who wrote song what a friend we have in jesus\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The episode title “The Jolly Roger” refers to Hook’s efforts to get his boat back, his true love, but really the vessel is just a stand-in for his actual true love, Emma, who—due to yet another unfortunate curse!—seems farther away from him than ever by the end of the episode.\" Ariel, who starts to cry as she mourns her loss, and Hook tells her he's sorry.

Also notable is Sporn's 1984 animation of Doctor De Soto by William \n\n Despite the state-of-the-art security systems built into the jail, inmate Kevin Jerome Pullum walked out of an employee exit on July 6, 2001, two hours after being convicted of attempted murder, and remained at large for eighteen days before he was apprehended within a mile of the jail. Pullum used a newspaper photograph of actor Eddie Murphy to alter an identification badge he used in the escape. The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest (and later release) of Petit, whose performance lasted for almost an hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments (with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present-day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man. On the morning of August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit performed a high-wire walk between the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center. He performed for 45 minutes, making eight passes along the wire. Though Petit was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, he was later freed in exchange for performing for children in Central Park. Before its destruction, the World Trade Center was a New York City icon, and the Twin Towers were the centerpiece that represented the entire complex.

Stephen Slesinger Inc.'s Pati Slesinger found merchandise that Disney did not pay royalties on. In 1983, Disney paid Stephen Slesinger Inc. and the Milne estate to end the royalty issue and agreed to a new contract that lowered Slesinger Inc.'s royalty percentage. Sometime around 2000, the Pooh Properties Trust licensed additional rights to Disney and accepted a buyout of their claims to royalties as defined in a 1991 lawsuit brought by Stephen Slesinger, Inc. To further minimize Disney's legal exposure to Slesinger, Disney paid money to the Pooh Properties attorneys and trusts to use the name of Clare Milne, daughter of Christopher Robin, in an attempt to terminate certain of the copyright rights \n\n time has passed, after the illustrator's death; in the UK, this will be on 1 January 2047.

A motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. Anatomy and physiology\n\nUpper motor neurons \n\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories. According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy. In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate. In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle. All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.

Different tables \n\ndeoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNAn  pyrophosphate + DNAn+1. During this process, DNA polymerase \"reads\" the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This results in elongation of the newly \n\n  Ribozymes (ribonucleic acid enzymes) are RNA molecules that have the ability to catalyze specific biochemical reactions, including RNA splicing in gene expression, similar to the action of protein enzymes. The most common activities of natural or in vitro-evolved ribozymes are the cleavage or ligation of RNA and DNA and peptide bond formation. Within the ribosome, ribozymes function as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA to link amino acids during protein synthesis. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is \"unzipped\" to expose the bases. The RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. This mRNA then carries the information to the ribosomes for protein synthesis through the process of translation, involving the coordinated action of rRNA and tRNA. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism.

Description: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.

The Japanese automobile manufacturer Daihatsu, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Group since 2016, has produced a multitude of vehicles since its inception in 1951. One example was the construction of the Motomachi Plant in 1959, which gave Toyota a decisive lead over Nissan during the 1960s. In 1950, a separate sales company, Toyota Motor Sales Co., was established (which lasted until July 1982).

After being held intermittently since 1894, the Carnaval de Québec has been celebrated annually since 1955. That year, Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the festival, made his first appearance. Up to one million people attended the Carnaval de Québec in 2006 making it, at the time, the largest winter festival in the world (since overtaken by the Harbin Festival). It is, however, the largest winter festival in the Western Hemisphere. Special events related to the 400th anniversary were also incorporated into major events held in Quebec City in 2008, including the Quebec Winter Carnival, the Quebec International Air Show, Red Bull Crashed Ice, the Quebec City Summer Festival, the Men's World Hockey Championships, the Eucharist Congress, the Winter Triathlon, and the Summit. The folklore of French Canada includes some rituals associated with Church holidays. A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities. In Canada, Quebec City, Quebec holds an ice sculpture festival each year during the Quebec City Winter Carnival. For the sheer variety of ice sculptures and the number of visitors, the Quebec festival is regarded by some as the best in the world.

In Galatians, Paul says that James, Peter and John will minister to the \"circumcised\" (in general Jews and Jewish proselytes) \n\n Paul seems to have refused \"to be tied down to particular patterns of behavior and practice.\" Paul himself described several meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though it is difficult to reconcile any of them fully with the account in Acts (see also Paul the Apostle). Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. Paul was in contact with this community. According to Dunn, this was not an \"usurpation of power,\" but a consequence of Peter's involvement in missionary activities. He persuaded the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community. While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Paul was, before his conversion, an antagonist of the followers of Jesus.

Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES. With the lowered prices, popularity of the video game industry continued to grow and the first video game magazine, Electronic Games, was printed. With the American-produced games on the downswing, Nintendo successfully launched the Nintendo Entertainment System in America in 1985, revitalizing the market with the introduction of the third and fourth generation of home consoles such as the Master System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari 7800, and the TurboGrafx-16, with systems transitioning to support 3D graphics and support for optical media rather than cartridges. The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, each of which became long-running Nintendo franchises. During the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials on video game mechanics were rare, and players instead were oriented to a new video game by its level design. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by directing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything players need to \"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\", to be able to play more freely, so that it becomes \"their game\". The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed. Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984).\n\nQuestion: what was the first video game for nintendo\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks do a test called a \"type and crossmatch\" on the donor's and the recipient's blood. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Generally, donors are not allowed to give blood more than once every 56 days. That is why health officials have restricted blood donor eligibility and made blood testing thorough. VIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.Hepatitis B remains the most common potentially serious disorder transmitted by blood transfusions, with a current risk of about 1 infection for every 137,000 units of blood transfused.AIDS\n\nIn the United States, donated blood is tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS. Approximately 91% of people test positive for Sd(a) through blood typing, and 96% test positive through urine testing. The frequency of the Lan-negative blood type is estimated at 1 in 50,000 in Japanese populations, 1 in 20,000 in Caucasians, and 1 in 1,500 in black people from South Africa. A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type.The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.Some blood types are far more common than others.Conditions that permanently disqualify a person from donating blood include hepatitis B or C, heart disease, certain types of cancer (leukemia, lymphoma, and any type of cancer that has recurred after treatment or that has ever been treated with chemotherapy drugs), severe asthma, bleeding disorders, possible exposure to prion diseases (such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—see Overview of Prion Diseases), AIDS, and possible exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS) due to high-risk behaviors (see Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection). A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.\n\nQuestion: what is the most common blood type in sweden\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was written by Jacques Morali and Village People lead singer Victor Willis. It served as Willis' theme song with the Village People. It is well known as the opening theme to the American TV show Cops and the theme song of the Bad Boys franchise. Although Allmusic critic Amy Hanson found \"Hot Cop\" to be \"dismally boring\" she describes it as a \"tribute to the triumph of the disco scene, as Victor Willis patrolled the floors, letting all who dared to dance know, 'this is the hot cop talking to you. Allmusic's Hanson praises the song's vocals, both the \"powerful vocals\" of lead singer Willis and the backing vocals provided by the other Village People members. Marc Zakem of The Courier-Journal praises the lyrical wit and musical vitality of \"Hot Cop\" stating that it is \"the first disco song I've heard in a long time in which I can actually imagine a roomful of dancing people.\" The song featured in the 2009 film Paul Blart: Mall Cop, in which it was used as the main character's cell phone ringtone which prevented him from solving cases. The theme music was Jackson's \"Nasty\", performed by Lisa Keith, though the lyrics were slightly changed to make the song more pertinent to the storyline.\n\nQuestion: who sings the theme song for the tv show cops\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Houston starter Zach Greinke effectively shut down the Nationals for six innings, as meanwhile, a visibly laboring Max Scherzer grinded through a five-inning, two-run start, giving up a home run in the second inning to Yuli Gurriel and an RBI single to Carlos Correa in the fifth inning. The longest interval between no-hitters was 12 years, 2 months and 10 days from the combined no-hitter led by Roy Oswalt on June 11, 2003, and that thrown by Fiers on August 21, 2015.

Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. The Minimum Wage Fairness Act is a bill that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. In the United States workers generally must be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage. Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring.

The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Prior to the Order, under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, all public and commercial buildings, and all non-single-household domestic dwellings (apart from houses in multiple occupation), were required to hold a valid fire safety certificate issued annually after an inspection by the Fire Service. This regime was replaced with assessment by third-party fire-risk assessors contracted by building owners and landlords, with no mandated timeframe for checks, and no mandated professional qualifications. Their powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation. Once a building is occupied the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (Fire Safety Order 2005 - FSO2005) requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the \"Responsible Person(s)\" for the building to provide and maintain \"suitable and sufficient\" general fire precautions. Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect.\n\nQuestion: when did the the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005 first come into effect\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is Springsteen's first and so far only album of entirely non-Springsteen material and contains his interpretation of thirteen folk music songs made popular by activist folk musician Pete Seeger. Using songs written by others, Seeger focused on popularizing and promoting the ethic of local, historical musical influences and recognizing the cultural significance that folk music embodies. Springsteen's project began in 1997, when he recorded \"We Shall Overcome\" for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year. The subsequent Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions Band Tour expanded on the album's musical approach. The Balham Alligators ; Gary U.S. Bonds and Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen had originally recorded the song for his 1980 album, The River, but it was never released and he decided to re-record the song with Bonds for his 1981 album, Dedication) . ; The Flatlanders ; Joan Baez included a recording of the song on her 1970 album (I Live) One Day at a Time. The title of the song is referenced in Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1991 song \"Down at the Twist and Shout\" and Adam Carroll's 2000 song \"Errol's Song\". Some of the song's images reference the recent history of Springsteen's hometown Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (such as the \"textile mill being closed\" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold). Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length.

Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to interpret legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established. The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term legislation is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term primary legislation may be used to exclude these other forms. These roles move into the realm of practice usually reserved for physicians, such as diagnosing disease and prescribing medications and treatments. Many also have teaching responsibilities, especially in large medical centers. For example, nurse researchers might look at how staff mix or educational preparation affects patient outcomes. Flexibility is a key strength in their role, as constant innovations in practice and science drive education. You should have additional education in pedagogy (the art of teaching) to prepare yourself for this role. Their work is rarely performed on the direct clinical level but is typically focused more on systems issues such as staffing, quality of care and meeting regulatory requirements. The public policy arena offers an opportunity for nurses to advise legislators on health care policy, develop legislation and provide expert advice on various public policy issues related to nursing and healthcare. Public policy includes opportunities at the local, state and national level. Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the future. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in digital formats, then lost track over time. Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in time capsules or other special storage environments. In 2006 the Congressional Research Service (CRS) compiled a report on the use of earmarks in thirteen Appropriation Acts from 1994 through 2005 in which they noted that there was \"not a single definition of the term earmark accepted by all practitioners and observers of the appropriations process, nor [was] there a standard earmark practice across all appropriation bills.\" It was noted at that time, that while the CRS did not summarize earmarks that they came in two varieties: hard earmarks, or \"hardmarks\", found in legislation, and soft earmarks, or \"softmarks\", found in the text of congressional committee reports. Hard earmarks are legally binding, whereas soft earmarks are not but are customarily acted upon as if they were. These methods include clinical document audits, adverse event reports, standardised patients, and direct observation of the clinical act. Clinical document audits are one way to assess clinical safety. This involves reviewing medical records and other relevant documents to identify any errors or deviations from standards of care. By scrutinizing these records, healthcare professionals can find areas for improvement and take necessary steps to prevent future errors. Healthcare professionals and patients can report any adverse events or incidents that occur during the course of patient care. These reports help identify potential safety issues and serve as valuable sources of information for improving patient safety in primary care settings. This method allows for the identification of any gaps in clinical practice and provides an opportunity for improvement. Direct observation of the clinical act involves experienced observers monitoring healthcare providers during patient encounters. Observers can provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvements to enhance clinical safety. This centralized information can help prevent errors related to miscommunication or incomplete information. These tools assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions, reducing the risk of medication errors, and improving overall patient safety. EMRs also allow for the implementation and monitoring of preventive measures, such as reminder systems for vaccinations or routine screenings. They facilitate better coordination of care among healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive appropriate follow-up and timely interventions. Electronic medical records contribute to improving the clinical act by providing a centralized repository of patient information, supporting clinical decision-making, and enabling preventive measures and better care coordination.\n\nQuestion: a legislative act passed by congress is an example of\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The American large-note bills became known as \"horse blankets\" or \"saddle blankets.\" Currently printed denominations are \n\n $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never \n\n circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the American Council of the Blind, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill. The United States dollar (symbol: ; code: USD; also abbreviated US$ or U.S. Dollar, to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, American dollar, or colloquially buck) is the official currency of the United States and its territories. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents.

These stimuli are then converted into electrical signals that travel along the axons of the sensory neurons and enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Once inside the spinal cord, the sensory information is processed and integrated with other signals before being transmitted to the brain for further interpretation and perception. It houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons and serves as a relay station for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. These nerves are carried by sensory nerves and are responsible for transmitting sensory signals to the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system, afferent and efferent nerve fibers are part of the somatic nervous system and originate outside of the spinal cord. Afferent fibers are carried by sensory nerves into the spinal cord, while efferent fibers are carried by motor nerves out of the spinal cord to act on skeletal muscles. The cell bodies of afferent neurons are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, specifically in the dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. For example, certain afferent neurons called intrafusal muscle fibers function as stretch receptors by detecting changes in muscle length. One important pathway is the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which transmits sensations from the periphery via afferent nerve fibers. In summary, afferent nerve fibers serve the role of conveying sensory information from the sensory receptors to the brain. This segment allows the sensory information to be processed and integrated within the central nervous system. In this process, synapses occur only in the gray matter, which is where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located. Sensory neurons are classified as pseudounipolar neurons and have cell bodies located in ganglia along the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Reference: They have a single process that divides into a peripheral segment that brings information from the periphery to the cell body and a central segment that carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. Nuclei of the CNS are the morphologic and functional equivalents of the ganglia of the PNS. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located in the ventral (anterior) horn of the gray matter. Because the motor neuron conducts impulses away from the CNS, it is an efferent neuron. The axon of a motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, passes through the ventral (anterior) root, becomes a component of the spinal nerve of that segment, and as such is conveyed to the muscle. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in ganglia that lie on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipol. These nerve fibers play a crucial role in transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body. On the other hand, the gray matter forms an inner butterfly-shaped pattern surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. It contains the cell bodies of neurons as well as nerve fibers. The sensory neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia. It is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels. In areas where the gray matter contains many large motor nerve cells that control limb movement, the gray matter and spinal cord are considerably larger compared to areas where the gray matter contains motor neurons for the muscles of the torso.

They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. Safety considerations in such high voltages require speaker line installation within conduit in most of the world. Special-purpose transformers capable of handling 1250 watts down as low as 50 Hz are available.

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.

If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin.

In November 1497, a fleet of Portuguese ships under the command of the Portuguese mariner Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope. Da Gama's fleet proceeded northwards to Zanzibar and later sailed eastwards, eventually reaching India and opening the Cape Route between Europe and Asia.

Buildings were made out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.

It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. In the stomach, gastric juice plays a crucial role in digestion. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion. To protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield. The end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. In the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. Carbohydrate digestion in the small intestine finishes converting digestible polysaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides into monosaccharides that can be absorbed. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell.

Researchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb. \"Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy,\" she told Reuters Health. Her new study included 272 preemies being treated at 11 NICUs that had music therapists. At different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played. They found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds. Sucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics. Previous research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care. There were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music. They said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available. \"The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over,\" Loewy said. Loewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well. From the general practice nurse to the ICU nurse, lung sounds tell you a great deal about a patient and their relative health. For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition. What was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema. – Listening for lung sounds. Wheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Stridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction. A pericardial rub and a pleural rub will often sound similar, and the best way to distinguish between the two is to make the patient hold their breath. We are going to listen to the heart over the valves, and nothing more. Now, if you hear a murmur over the valve… we are getting somewhere. You know there are four valves in your heart: aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral. The mitral valve is relatively easy to find if you are used to taking an apical pulse. The first sound you hear in the cardiac cycle is the “lub,” and it is a sound full of meaning. It is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing as the body empties the ventricles into the lungs and body. It is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing. Occasionally, you may hear a “split” S2 that sounds like “du-dub.” This is the aortic valve closing slightly before the pulmonic valve and is often a normal sound heard on inspiration. To hear a ventricular gallop, or S3, you should listen over the mitral valve with the bell. It will sound like a weird plopping noise right after you hear the “dub.” The whole heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Kentucky’. This heart sound can indicate heart ischaemia or heart failure. However, it is a normal sound in young adults under 30. S4 is the heart sound for atrial gallop, and the heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Tennessee’. Listen over the mitral valve with the bell of the stethoscope. You will hear the plopping noise just before the “lub” starts, which means it happens right before systole starts. This heart sound can tell you quite a bit. It is heard after heart attacks, and can indicate aortic stenosis, ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension. They will often sound like the words “rush” or “hush” and can last throughout the heartbeat. The above sample is of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) holosystolic heart murmur, caused by a opening in the dividing walls of the left and right heart ventricles. Most nurses carry out a cursory listen for bowel sounds, but you may not realise how variable and important these sounds can be. Instead of really focusing on the sounds, you may simply write down what you think you hear. For instance, the absence of bowel sounds after a surgery can indicate an ileus before the patient starts vomiting or complaining of abdominal pain. For this reason, it is important to go over bowel sounds once more, pay closer attention to them, and not use them merely as a stepping stool to the next level of assessment. You should know the structures within each area to help determine what the bowel sounds mean. Knowing the structures under your stethoscope will help you determine the nature of the bowel sounds. Although you can listen for vascular sounds over the abdomen, such as abdominal aortic bruits, most of the time you are listening for the sounds of the bowels themselves. To chart an assessment finding of no bowel sounds, you need to listen over the quadrant for at least five minutes. You should also do your auscultation before palpation and percussion to avoid influencing bowel sounds. Hypoactive bowel sounds could indicate a problem, so if you are having trouble hearing them this is significant. Hyperactive bowel sounds, on the other hand, may indicate stomach upset, cramping and anything that is increasing peristalsis. Hypoactive bowel sounds in the right upper quadrant could indicate a bowel obstruction there. Auscultating bowel sounds can allow you to pinpoint areas where an obstruction may have occurred. Finding no bowel sounds can mean an ileus, or an obstruction above that area of the intestine. Hypoactive bowel sounds are considered as one every three to five minutes, and this can indicate diarrhoea, anxiety, or gastroenteritis. Hyperactive bowel sounds are often found before a blockage. It is quite common to find one quadrant with hyperactive bowel sounds and one with none or hypoactive ones. You may also hear high-pitched sounds and rushing noises. It is important to chart the location, quality, intensity, and frequency of bowel sounds to document the GI system completely. Most nurses default to bowel sounds active in all four quadrants, but you need to be aware that this may not always be the case. A harried and hurried nurse may perform a quick assessment, but bowel sounds are a great indicator of the overall health of the patient. While everyone knows to listen for bowel sounds, that isn’t the only way to assess this important part of the anatomy. However, you should probably listen to bowel sounds before manipulating the stomach as this can cause changes in the way the sounds are heard. By slowing down assessment and giving the abdomen the time and attention it needs, nurses can notice problems that may get past even the most experienced doctors. This short video provides a four-minute overview of things to remember when performing a nursing assessment of bowel function in a palliative care setting. In very thin people, you will be able to see the movements of peristalsis, but you may also be able to see abnormal pulses of the descending aorta. Percussion of the abdomen can’t tell you nearly as much as the other forms of assessment can, but it can shed some light on what’s going on under that tissue. To percuss, you place two fingers over an area and knock on your fingertips with the fingertips of the other hand. This will allow the sound to travel through the tissue. In the case of masses, percussion will sound different from normal bowel tissue. Most bowel sounds are rather hollow and empty, but a mass will have a thicker, duller sound. Blockages will sound different as well, and if you are unable to hear bowel sounds in a quadrant, it may be worth percussing over the area, searching for a blockage. Chorus—Arise! Oh, heed the signal well, And the thunder tone as it rolls along Shall sound oppression's knell; For the arm of freedom is mighty still, But strength shall fail us never, Its strength shall fail us never, That strength we'll give to our righteous cause, And our glorious land forever. Chorus—Arise! When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound. Listening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the 5th most unpleasant sound is that of nails scraping against a blackboard (listen). Listen to the sound of a ruler on a bottle, the 4th most unpleasant sound in the study. The 3rd most unpleasant sound is that of chalk on a blackboard (listen). The 2nd most unpleasant sound is that of a fork scraping against a glass (listen), according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the number one most unpleasant sound is that of a knife scraping against a bottle (listen). \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.The sounds used in BioAcoustics are created by frequency generating and filtering equipment, which patients listen to either in a sound room or through headphones. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning\n\nFor nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.\n\nQuestion: who sings stop listen what 's that sound\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additional verses were added in May 1960 by Joe Hickerson, who turned it into a circular song. The 1964 release of the song as a Columbia Records Hall of Fame series 45 single, 13-33088, by Pete Seeger was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002 in the Folk category. Seeger found inspiration for the song in October 1955 while he was on a plane bound for a concert at Oberlin College, one of the few venues which would hire him during the McCarthy era. Where are the girls, they've all taken husbands. These lines were taken from the traditional Cossack folk song \"Koloda-Duda\", referenced in the Mikhail Sholokhov novel And Quiet Flows the Don (1934), which Seeger had read \"at least a year or two before\". In a 2013 interview, Seeger explained that he borrowed the melody from an Irish lumberjack song with the words 'Johnson says he'll load more hay.' Springsteen's project began in 1997, when he recorded \"We Shall Overcome\" for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year.

Physiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. All muscles in the body are affected. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

This process references the breaking down of a body of an animal such as a human post-mortem (meaning after death). In broad terms, it can be viewed as the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors.

It's a cover of \"The Joker\" by Kato, an Belgian artist, it was her first single after her participation at Idols 2011. It was released on May 18, 2004 through Psychopathic Records and consists of nine previously unreleased tracks and five remixes, including a \"surprisingly faithful\" cover of the Steve Miller Band's \"The Joker\". AllMusic's reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote \"The song is likely a coded reference to those obsessed-over joker cards. But it's nice to think of Twiztid as regular-guy Michiganders, singing karaoke at the local sports bar\". He was a member of the 1960s psychedelic rock band Frumious Bandersnatch. He later played drums with the Steve Miller Band, playing on their 1973 album The Joker. \"Angel\" uses the bassline from \"The Joker\" by Steve Miller Band (1973). The chorus melody is from \"Angel of the Morning\", originally written and composed by Chip Taylor, that has been recorded numerous times and has been a hit single for various artists including Merrilee Rush, Juice Newton, Nina Simone, P.

It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family. In January 2021 the lyrics were changed again. It was composed in 1860 by then 25-year-old Prince William Charles Lunalilo, who later became King Lunalilo. It remained Hawaii's national anthem until 1866, when it was replaced by Queen Liliuokalani's composition He Mele Lāhui Hawaii. The anthem is sung every 10 September by the general public at the annual release of red and white ticker paper on Gibraltar National Day. By tradition, the tune \"God Save the King\" (or \"God Save the Queen\" in the reign of a female monarch) was heard in the Canadian colonies since the late 18th century and continued to be played after Confederation in 1867. In 1980, \"O Canada\" was adopted as the national anthem and \"God Save the Queen\" became, by convention, the Royal Anthem, for use as a musical salute to the sovereign in person or as a display of loyalty in any circumstance.

The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. ten-hour workday. On March 26, 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, which was \"signed by one thousand citizens of New York and Brooklyn.\" The ten-hour workday would not be implemented until March 31, 1840, when President Martin Van Buren finally mandated a ten-hour workday for all mechanics and laborers employed on public works.\" In 1848, the yard had 441 employees who typically worked a ten hour day, six days a week. When the Directive was implemented in the UK, regulation 13 originally stated \"four weeks\" but many employers only gave their workers four five-day periods of leave (i.e. For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday.

A total of 33 half-hour episodes, each of which included three 7-minute shorts, were produced over three seasons, from 1980 to 1982 on ABC. Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season. Out of the 99 shorts that were produced, 86 of them feature Scooby-Doo, his nephew Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy without the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, and the other 13 only feature Scrappy-Doo and Yabba-Doo. It premiered on September 10, 1983, featuring the return of Daphne, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program made up of two eleven-minute short cartoons. Thirteen half-hour episodes, composed of twenty-four separate segments were produced under the New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo title in 1983, and thirteen more episodes, composed of twenty separate segments were produced under the name The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984.

This theme highlights the complex emotional journey that caregivers often experience. Additionally, the story delves into the impact of cultural narratives and societal expectations on caregivers' sense of self and moral certitude. The tension between societal expectations and personal desires is highlighted in the story, as Mr. Cassidy insists that his wife is still the woman he married and that her care is not too much for him, despite his internal struggle. The story emphasizes the complex emotional journey, the struggle to preserve personhood, and the influence of cultural narratives on the caregiver's experience.

It was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020, and was released to the public on November 12, 2020. Most notably, macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign that features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy and also includes a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism, among other changes. To mark the transition, the operating system's major version number was incremented, for the first time since 2000, from 10 to 11. The operating system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California. macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) is the fourteenth major release of macOS, Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. macOS High Sierra was announced at the WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017 and was released on September 25, 2017. Following on from macOS Sierra, its iterative name also alludes to its status as a refinement of its predecessor, focused on performance improvements and technical updates rather than user features. This makes it similar to previous macOS releases Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan.

The playoffs began on April 12, 2017, and ended on June 11, 2017. The 2020–21 NBA season was the Celtics' 75th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the regular season for the league began on December 22, 2020 and featured a 72-game schedule rather than the typical 82-game schedule. The Celtics finished the regular season with a 36–36 record, and clinched a playoff spot after defeating the Washington Wizards with a score of 118–110 in the play-in tournament. The Finals were originally scheduled for June, but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus. After the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year.

In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. In the United States, the legal drinking age is currently 21. Setting a legal drinking age of 21 is designed to discourage reckless alcohol consumption by youth, limiting consumption to those who are more mature, who can be expected to make reasonable and wise decisions when it comes to drinking. Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption.\n\nQuestion: when was the drinking age set to 21\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide, high-energy electrons, and ATP. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nQuestion: how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is located at the base of the brain and is where the optic nerves partially cross over. This crossing allows for a specific arrangement of visual information to be transmitted to different areas of the brain. These optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where some fibers from each nerve cross over to join fibers from the opposite side. This crossing over of fibers has important implications for how visual information is processed in the brain. After crossing at the optic chiasm, these fibers continue their journey along pathways known as optic tracts towards specific regions in the brain responsible for processing visual information. The majority of these fibers go to a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in thalamus, which acts as a relay station before sending signals to other parts of the brain involved in vision, such as primary visual cortex. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain. A pathway consists of an optic nerve, the fibers of an optic nerve traveling through the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, and optic radiations terminating in an occipital lobe. Each optic nerve contains fibers from only one retina. The optic chiasm contains fibers from the nasal parts of the retinas of both eyes; these fibers cross to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe. Thus the optic tracts, occipital lobe, lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus, and optic chiasm each contain nerve fibers from both eyes. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain.

The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe. It is characterized by moderate disk elevation without hemorrhages. The visual pathways comprise the optic nerve and optic chiasm, which are essential for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. The optic nerve consists of about a million nerve fibers that arise from the inner, ganglion cell layer of the retina. These fibers pass through the lamina cribrosa of the sclera and then course through the optic canal of the skull to form the optic chiasm. Within the optic chiasm, fibers from the nasal half of the retina decussate (cross over to the opposite side), while fibers from the lateral (temporal) half do not cross over. This arrangement allows for the integration of visual information from both eyes in the brain. From the optic chiasm, the visual pathways continue to the visual cortex in the brain, where visual processing occurs.

It contains the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1569, the dome over the church of Madonna dell'Umiltà in Pistoia was completed by Giorgio Vasari at the behest of Cosimo I de' Medici, over a building designed and built by others. Although clearly referencing Florence Cathedral visually and in the use of two shells, structurally the octagonal dome is similar to the much earlier dome of Florence Baptistery and the hemispherical shape of Michelangelo's design for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. who began construction of the octagonal church in 1495, and work continued until his death in 1522. In 1563, the Grand Duke Cosimo I Medici entrusted completion to Giorgio Vasari, who elaborated the tall dome. The main altar was designed in 1579 by Pietro Tacca. But concerns about the stability emerged, and Bartolomeo Ammanati was called to create further reinforcement, concerned about the weight of the lantern, to the structure by Vasari. The facade of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is another example of the beginnings of the early Renaissance. The Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan), famous for the mural of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci is an example of the progression of architecture beyond the Gothic period and towards the Renaissance.

Cassiopea (upside-down jellyfish) is a genus of true jellyfish and the only members of the family Cassiopeidae. The medusa usually lives upside-down on the bottom, which has earned them the common name. These jellyfish partake in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates and therefore, must lay upside-down in areas with sufficient light penetration to fuel their energy source.

The most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the \"three seconds rule\" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. The line defense was the catalyst of the future 3-2 zone defense. In the NBA this rule is applied only in a throw in scenario. After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession. The lane is a restricted area in which players on offense (in possession of the ball) can stay for only three seconds. At all levels of play, after three seconds the player is assessed a three-second violation which results in a turnover. In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a defensive three-second violation, which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the clock resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.\n\nQuestion: when was the defensive 3 second rule implemented\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was initially the governor of passengers on the ship Speedwell until that ship was found to be unseaworthy, and later on the Mayflower, until replaced by John Carver. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact, but perished with the first Pilgrims to die the winter of 1620, exact date unknown.

On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. Edward Tilley (c. 1588 – c. winter of 1620/1621) traveled in 1620 on the historic voyage of the ship Mayflower as a Separatist member of the Leiden, Holland contingent.

It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, and is joined by principal cast members Candice Patton, Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin. The episode focuses on the aftermath of Nora West-Allen's partnership with Eobard Thawne being exposed to Team Flash, and flashbacks showing how the two initially met. Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard gave The Flash episode an A−, feeling \"Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet... Agard felt the focus on the Team Flash drama made the episode \"drag a bit\" and, like Schedeen, his \"biggest problems were with the Wally stuff\" but conceded it was included \"for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans.\" While Cavanagh would continue playing Thawne on The Flash, Letscher subsequently went on to portray a time-displaced version of the character in season two of Legends of Tomorrow. In a flashback in season one, Barry Allen's (who will later become the speedster known as the Flash) mother Nora is murdered by a yellow blur and his father Henry wrongfully convicted. In the present, the murderer ultimately appears as a tachyon-enhanced speedster who is dubbed the \"Reverse-Flash\", and bests Barry in combat.

The present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow & Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Constructed predominantly from concrete-clad steel, it is 1026 ft in length and ends in a three-tiered pier-head, featuring a cafe, bar, lounge, and fishing decks. A notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was over 100 ft shorter. In 2018, the pier underwent restoration at a cost of £500,000, in addition to installing more than 300 m of gas mains supply, as the pier's own gas supply had developed problems. The works coincided with the 60 year anniversary of the pier's official opening. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986.

After killing Regina's true love, Daniel the stable boy, Regina banishes Cora to Wonderland through a looking-glass, where she eventually becomes the Queen of Hearts. The show's spin-off, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, shows that Cora was the Red Queen's tutor in magic whilst in Wonderland; Cora apparently ruled part of the land and was a political rival of the Red King. In her earlier life, Cora (portrayed by Rose McGowan) was also the miller's daughter (the heroine of the Rumpelstiltskin story). He makes an \"I promise you the world\"-type vow that he will come back in two weeks with a ring of gold, and proves it by giving Cora a ring he made out of straw.

John Blaney claims that it captures \"an atmosphere of listless intoxication.\" Music journalist Paul du Noyer believes that Charlie Patton's \"Ain't Goin' Down That Dirt Road\" may have been an influence on the song. Matthew Jones was a schooled, experienced musician, and became active in the Civil Rights Movement when he joined the Nashville Student Movement in 1960. Jones relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, with his brother Marshall, who was also affiliated with the SNCC and their music ensemble, the Freedom Singers. Crowell adjusted the tempo of the song and added instrumentation from session musicians such as Ilya Toshinsky and Jenee Fleenor. The final recording also features vocal ad-libs from Hunt's road band, as well as Gorley's daughter and her friends. Hunt has said that the song is possibly his favorite song off his album Southside. Wendy Hermanson and Billy Dukes of Taste of Country wrote of the song that \"the overall result isn't 100 percent a traditional country song. Paisley told The Tennessean that the song idea come from his own upbringing near the Ohio River: \"My best memories with my grandfather are on that body of water, and my dad, and learning to ski. It's kind of like a back-to-basics song, which is really an inner tube and a boat and you've got a theme park.\" Paisley debuted the song at the 2014 Academy of Country Music telecast on April 6. He also performed the song during the third episode of ABC's Rising Star. Wright also recorded it on his own self-titled debut album for Liberty Records in 1992. In 1993, Walker opened for George Strait and Alan Jackson and he stated in an interview with Billboard \"I'm real grateful for the opportunity to open for those guys\", with only one hit record, it's hard to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes, but it's working.

Twenty-one countries presented their films at the \"First Cannes International Film Festival\", which took place at the former Casino of Cannes. During the first festival, the jury was made up of one representative per country, with French historian Georges Huisman as the Jury President. The 59th Cannes Film Festival was held from 17 to 28 May 2006. Twenty films from eleven countries were in competition for the Palme d'Or. Paris, je t'aime opened the Un Certain Regard section of the festival. The festival takes place in mid-October. The festival, nicknamed \"Cannes on the Mississippi\", features national and international feature films and short films. The festival had one off-year when New Orleans suffered the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. the festival had grown into an internationally respected annual event that attracts 20–25,000 people, 400+ filmmakers, and 240 films. The 58th Cannes Film Festival started on 11 May and ran until 22 May 2005. The Palme d'Or went to the Belgian film L'Enfant by Dardenne brothers. The 15th Cannes Film Festival was held from 7 to 23 May 1962. During the Cannes Film Festival of 1961, Robert Favre le Bret, Artistic Director of the Cannes Film Festival, with the agreement of the French Union of Film Critics, had decided to establish the International Critics' Week during the next Festival. In 1962, this parallel section of the Festival took place for the first time.\n\nQuestion: when does the cannes film festival take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

And I thought, \"Wow, good idea.\" So I wrote the lyrics as a parody and I wrote it as a joke. If you read the lyrics, they're kind of silly. I'm thinking, you know, here we are, this totally hard thrash band, we kick in your face and rape and murder your wife, and now here we're writing a parody of a '60s or '50s dance number. And then Gary read the lyrics and was, like, \"These are brilliant, dude.\" I'm all, \"No way. If we put this on there, they're going to kill us. Are you kidding? They're going to be flipping us off.\"\" such as \"Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit\". Aukerman explained of the song: I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, \"I Quit\" is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no \"message\" to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, \"I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me.\" :P Well and I'm also dealing with a bout of depression but I'm working on that.

Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak. example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural. There is a \"strong\" pronoun and a \"weak\" pronoun. In conversation, both the strong and the weak can be used together \n\n German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. It has strong and weak verbs. German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, Austrian, and Swiss Standard High German.\n\nQuestion: how many strong verbs are there in german\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. \"In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity.\" British journalist James Bartholomew claims to have originated the modern usage of the term \"virtue signalling,\" in a 2015 Spectator article. His 2015 formulation described virtue signaling as empty boasting (directly or otherwise): \"No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. Merriam-Webster editor Emily Brewster describes virtue signalling as an academic-sounding counterpart to the term humblebrag, a term coined by Harris Wittels in 2010.\n\n wait for what is desired ; Perseverance - ability to work steadily despite setbacks or difficulties ; Persistence - ability to continue or repeat a task in order to achieve a goal ; Virtues of regard ; Fair-mindedness - concern that all get their due (including oneself) in cooperative arrangements of mutual benefit ; Tolerance - willingness to allow others to lead a life based on a certain set of beliefs differing from one's own ; Truthfulness/Honesty - telling someone what you know to be true in the context of a direct inquiry ; Virtues of respect ; Respect - regard for the worth of others ; Self respect - regard \n\n  Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual.

During this session, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the league, publicly proposed the Two Nation Theory for the first time. The resolution was passed by the League session in Lahore on 23 March 1940. Gandhi's reaction to the Lahore Resolution was muted; he called it \"baffling\", but told his disciples that Muslims, in common with other people of India, had the right to \n\n Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III (2 November 1877 – 11 July 1957) was the 48th Imam of the Nizari Ismaili sect of Islam. He shared Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's belief that Muslims should first build up their social capital through advanced education before engaging in politics. The Muslim Conference leaders were briefed on the invasion plans and told to communicate them Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, the jailed president of the Muslim Conference. The Muslim League held its annual session at Minto Park in Lahore, Punjab, that lasted from 23 to 25 March 1940. During this event, the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other Founding Fathers narrated the events regarding the differences between Hindus and Muslims, and introduced the historical resolution that cemented the formation of a nation-state in South Asia as Pakistan, even though it did not actually mention Pakistan at all. The resolution was moved by Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq (Abul Kashem Fozlul Hôk) (26 October 1873 – 27 April 1962), often called Sher-e-BangaL, passed on 24 March and had its signatures from the Founding Fathers of Pakistan.

He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc. Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider, through his bond with Saphira. Brom gives Eragon his blessing, reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider, with a dragon named Saphira, and dies. Saphira uses magic to encase Brom in a diamond tomb. Near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in a jail that holds a female elf he had had recurring dreams about. The dragons come in several colors which generally correlate with their sizes; blue males, green females, brown males, bronze males, and golden females – queens.

This event spurred the installation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network in 1969 to monitor regional earthquake activity. St. Helens and other Cascade Volcanos leading up to the deadly May 18 eruption and in the years following. This fault runs from northern Vancouver Island, west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, up to the Gulf of Alaska. Because this quake occurred before the modern surface wave magnitude scale was developed and widely implemented, this earthquake may have only had the same overall intensity as the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. In future there may be some research done to compare the two earthquake events. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, a megathrust earthquake that occurred along the Pacific Northwest coast from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia which reached magnitude 9 on the Richter magnitude scale. In 2005, he published a book with others, \"The Orphan Tsunami of 1700,\" that summarizes the evidence for an 8.7–9.2 megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest on 26 January 1700, known as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The shock was located in the area between Olympia and Tacoma, and was felt throughout the state, as well as parts of Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. It is the largest recorded earthquake to occur in the Puget Sound region of Washington. The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years. There is also evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake.\n\nQuestion: what is the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the pacific northwest\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The United States of America (USA) was the host nation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The team finished first in the overall medal rankings for the first time since 1984, and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics.

This report defined a turning point in sustainability discourse since it deviated from the earlier limits-to-growth perspective to focus more on achieving social and economic milestones, and their connection to environmental goals, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable development interconnects three socially concerned systems—environment, society and economy—a system seeking to achieve a range of goals \n\n The intention of sustainable design is to \"eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design\". Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future. Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The report defined 'sustainable development' as \"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". One-planet living is a commonly used phrase. \"Around the middle of the century we’ll see global population peak at something like \n\n Defined by the United Nations Environment Programme as \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\" sustainable development may be considered together with the concepts of \"integration\" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and \"interdependence\" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent). The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).\n\nQuestion: when did the term sustainability start to be used\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But the crew members stated that they had sought the permission of the irrigation department and the village Panchayat for shooting. During the shooting of the climax portions near the Linganamakki Dam, environmental organisations opposed the permission granted to the production unit for shooting, suggesting a threat to the location as public \n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD), sometimes called zombie deer disease, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting deer. In the US, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, caribou, and moose. In addition, CWD has been found in one Minnesota red deer farm, one wild reindeer herd in Norway (March 2016) as well as in wild moose. Single cases of CWD in moose have been found in Finland (March 2018) and in Sweden (March and May 2019, September 2020). CWD was found in South Korea in some deer imported from Canada. No relationship is known between CWD and any other TSEs of animals or people. Williams performed necropsies on deer and elk that had died of an unknown syndrome. It read in conclusion that \"Although no association between (animal) CWD and (the feastors in Wisconsin who happened to have) CJD was found, continued surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk for CWD transmission to humans.\" Quebec farm outbreak\nThe MFFP ministry in Quebec practiced 9500 tests in the period between 2007 and autumn 2018 before they detected a seropositive case in September 2018. The September 2018 discovery of CWD on a managed operation in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge Quebec prompted a wholesale slaughter of 3500 animals in two months before the enterprise shut down permanently. The CFIA ordered the cull, as well as the decontamination of 10 inches of soil in certain places on the 1000-acre operation. Other Quebec producers lamented the glut of supply. A 400 km quarantine area was declared, in which all hunting and trapping activities were banned. The government slaughtered hundreds of wild animals over a two-month period. When the producer was forced to close, the weekly slaughter neared 500 animals per week. From one CWD-infected herd in Alberta, 131 elk were sold for human consumption. For the fall 2019 hunting season in western Quebec, the provincial ministry relaxed the rules for the annual white-tailed deer (WTD) hunt, in an effort to curb the spread of CWD. Any WTD can be hunted with any weapon in certain municipalities in the Outaouais valley and the Laurentides. The quarantine around Grenville was still in place, and the ministry specifically prohibited (only) the \"removal\" from the quarantine \"enhanced monitoring area\" zone of \"the head, more specifically any part of the brain, the eyes, the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils, any part of the spinal column, the internal organs (including the liver and the heart), and the testicles.\" Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease. Exposure between animals is associated with sharing food and water sources contaminated with CWD prions shed by diseased deer. Other cervid species, including caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets. Introduced for the 2019 Minnesota hunting season, a no-cost deer carcass-incineration program was rolled out by Crow Wing County officials hoping to stem the spread of CWD in the region. CWD was found among wild deer in Crow Wing County for the first time in January 2019. The voluntary program encourages both residents and visiting hunters to bring harvested deer carcasses to the county landfill east of Brainerd, Minnesota for incineration and disposal. Running a bioassay, taking fluids from animals in the deer family suspected of infection and incubating them in transgenic mice that express the cervid prion protein, can be used to determine whether the cervid is infected, but ethical issues exist with this, and it is not scalable. A tonsillar biopsy technique has been a reliable method of testing for CWD in live deer, but it only seems to be effective on mule deer and white-tailed deer, not elk. Epidemiology\n\nNorth America\nThe disease was first identified in 1967 in a closed herd of captive mule deer in contiguous portions of northeastern Colorado. The limited area of northern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and western Nebraska in which free-ranging deer, moose, and/or elk positive for CWD have been found is referred to as the endemic area. It is also found in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The affected animal was a white-tailed deer killed by a hunter. The first positive farmed-elk herd in the United States was detected in 1997 in South Dakota. Since then, additional positive elk herds and farmed white-tailed deer herds have been found in South Dakota (7), Nebraska (4), Colorado (10), Oklahoma (1), Kansas (1), Minnesota (3), Montana (1), Wisconsin (6), and New York (2). As of fall of 2006, four positive elk herds in Colorado and a positive white-tailed deer herd in Wisconsin remain under state quarantine. All of the other herds have been depopulated or have been slaughtered and tested, and the quarantine has been lifted from one herd that underwent rigorous surveillance with no further evidence of disease. CWD also has been found in farmed elk in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. A retrospective study also showed mule deer exported from Denver to the Toronto Zoo in the 1980s were affected. In June 2015, the disease was detected in a male white-tailed deer on a breeding ranch in Medina County, Texas. State officials euthanized 34 deer in an effort to contain a possible outbreak. In February 2018, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks announced that a Mississippi deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease. Species that have been affected with CWD include elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, and moose. By April 2016, CWD had been found in captive animals in South Korea; the disease arrived there with live elk that were imported from Canada for farming in the late 1990s. In the summer of 2018, cases were discovered in the Harpur Farm herd in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec. More than 8% of Alberta deer were deemed seropositive. Europe \nIn 2016, the first case of CWD in Europe was from the Nordfjella wild reindeer herd in southern Norway. Scientists found the diseased female reindeer as it was dying, and routine CWD screening at necropsy was unexpectedly positive. The origin of CWD in Norway is unknown, whereas import of infected deer from Canada was the source of CWD cases in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and deer into the country. Norway has a scrapie surveillance program since 1997; while no reports of scrapie within the range of Nordfjella reindeer population have been identified, sheep are herded through that region and are a potential source of infection. In May and June 2016, two infected wild moose (Alces alces) were found around 300 km north from the first case, in Selbu. In 2017, the Environment Agency of the Norwegian government released guidelines for hunters hunting reindeer in the Nordfjella areas. The guidelines contain information on identifying animals with CWD symptoms and instructions for minimizing the risk of contamination, as well as a list of supplies given to hunters to be used for taking and submitting samples from shot reindeer. In March 2018, Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA stated that the first case of CWD in Finland had been diagnosed in a 15-year-old moose (Alces alces) that had died naturally in the municipality of Kuhmo in the Kainuu region. Before this case in Kuhmo, Norway was the only country in the European Economic Area where CWD has been diagnosed. The moose did not have the transmissible North American form of the disease, but similar to the Norwegian variant of CWD, an atypical or sporadic form which occurs incidentally in individual animals of the deer family. In Finland, CWD screening of fallen wild deer has been done since 2003. The export of live animals of the deer family to other countries has been temporarily banned as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of the CWD, and moose hunters are going to be provided with more instructions before the start of the next hunting season, if appropriate. The export and sales of meat from deer will not be restricted and moose meat is considered safe to eat as only the brain and nervous tissue of infected moose contains prions. A 16-year old emaciated female moose was found in the municipality of Arjeplog in the county of Norrbotten, circling and with loss of shyness towards humans, possibly blind. The moose was euthanized and the head was sent for CWD screening in the national CWD surveillance program. A second case of CWD was diagnosed in May 2019, with very similar case history, about 70 km east of the first case. This second case, in the municipality of Arvidsjaur, was also an emaciated and apathic 16-year-old female moose that was euthanized. The circumstances of these Swedish cases are similar to the CWD cases in moose in both Norway and Finland. A minimum of 6 000 deer are to be tested, both free-ranging animals in the deer family, farmed red deer, and semi-domesticated reindeer. A fourth case of CWD in moose was verified in September 2020, in a euthanized 14-year-old lame and unshy female moose in the municipality of Robertsfors, in the county of Västerbotten, approximately 200 km from the previous moose cases in the neighboring county of Norrbotten.

The elephants featured in the film were constructed through CGI, and a disclaimer was issued for this at the beginning of the film. The chital is listed on the IUCN Red List as least concern \"because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large populations\". Currently, no range-wide threats to chitals are present, and they live in many protected areas. Hunting for the deer's meat has caused substantial declines and local extinctions. The axis deer is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh. The chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Alabama, Point Reyes National Seashore in California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Texas in the United States, and the Veliki Brijun Island in the Brijuni Archipelago of the Istrian Peninsula in Croatia.\n\nQuestion: where was the killing of a sacred deer filmed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2008 the biggest source of coal production, the Powder River Basin (53% = 49.2mt), was home to only 32% of coal reserves (behind U.S. Northern Appalachia (35% = 800mt) and Central Appalachia (32%, thermal coal). In its last annual report (2009) Massey Energy reported coal sales of 38 million tons (ranking sixth in the US), compared to 84.8 million tons sold by Alpha Natural Resources in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Massey Energy had a coal shipment shortfall of 1.4 million tons, half of which was due to rail problems, and the other half a result of misproduction. coal to oil and gas for their energy needs, and the industry yet again experienced a downturn. By 2001 8.36 billion tons of coal had been extracted from Kentucky, 5.78 billion tons coming from the Eastern Coalfield and 2.58 billion tons coming from the Western Coalfield. The federal government proposed a new rule for regulating coal mining that would attempt to reconcile environmental protection with the reality that the U.S. needs coal for energy. In 2008, the state mined 26 million short tons of coal, ranking #11 in the country in production. A typical new 1000 MW coal-fired power station produces around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on coal gasification technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW·h to 12 cents.\n\nQuestion: how much energy does coal produce in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

That would be, by number, nearly half of all subprime loans outstanding in the United States. These bonds would satisfy investors who are worried that mortgage prepayments would force them to re-invest their money at the exact moment interest rates are lower; \n\n When Fannie or Freddie bought subprime loans they were taking a chance because, as noted by Paul Krugman, \"a subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie and Freddie buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income.\" As noted, the SEC has alleged that Fannie and Freddie both ignored the law with regard to the purchase of subprime loans. However, some loans were so clearly lacking in quality that Fannie and Freddie wouldn't take a chance on buying them.

The electors are \"appointed\" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs \"on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.\" In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. The Electoral College employs a first-past-the-post voting system, where a candidate who receives the most votes wins. However, the popular vote is not used to determine who is elected as the nation's president or vice president.

Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The government of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic. El Salvador elects its head of state &ndash; the President of El Salvador &ndash; directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority. Salvadorans also elect a single-chamber, unicameral national legislature &ndash; the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador &ndash; composed of 84 members (deputies). In April 1991, during the negotiations between the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front to end the Salvadoran Civil War, an agreement was reached to reform various articles of the Constitution. One of these reforms was the conversion of the Central Electoral Council into the Supreme Electoral Court, and the addition of the two non-partisan members onto the makeup of the Court. The first challenge the new Court faced was the 1994 Salvadoran general election. Whilst the International Foundation for Electoral Systems' observers found that \"the El Salvador voting process was conducted in an orderly, peaceful and transparent fashion which permitted the popular will of the Salvadoran people to be expressed\", concerns were \n\n The 1950 constitution of El Salvador established a Central Electoral Council (Consejo Central de Elecciones, CCE) as the \"highest authority of electoral matters\".

The defeat was the fourth in a row to the Buckeyes. Prior to the 1937 season, Michigan had not lost four consecutive games to any opponents, but the 1937 season brought the team's fourth consecutive losses against all three major rivals – Michigan State, Minnesota, and Ohio State. Sources:  Following its clash with Northwestern, Michigan hosted its in-state rival, the Michigan State Spartans, for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan was dominated in the previous meeting, losing 35–11. This was the first time that GameDay came to Ann Arbor since Michigan defeated Notre Dame in 2013. Michigan extended its lead in the second quarter via a three-yard touchdown pass from John O'Korn to Sean McKeon.

We describe the case of a 16-year-old male who aspirated a beverage can tab resulting in significant functional impairment. Since the introduction of beverage can opening tabs (\"pop-tops\" or \"pull-tabs\") nearly 50 years ago, five cases of their aspiration have been reported in the literature and this is the first case to report tracheal lodgment. Also, given the marked prevalence of aluminum beverage cans, we suspect that the inadvertent aspiration of can tabs is more common than indicated by the paucity of published reports. Beverage openers vary in size but commonly include a glass bottle crown cork remover, glass bottle threaded metal crown cork cap grip for greater twisting torque, a plastic bottle cap grip for greater twisting torque and a stay tab lever for metal beverage cans.

The county's per-capita income and median household income make it one of the poorest counties in the United States. Among counties whose population contains a non-Hispanic white majority, Clay County was once the poorest by per-capita income and second to another county in the same Kentucky region, Owsley County, by median household income. However, in recent years the economic status of Clay County, Kentucky has improved relative to other lower income counties. These are funded by county taxes, which are assessed on all incorporated and unincorporated areas.

Therefore sacroiliac joint dysfunction may contribute to lumbar, buttock, hamstring or groin pain. Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. The fascia and muscles within the region provide significant self bracing and self locking to the SI joint and its ligaments through their cross like anatomical configuration. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia. Broadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Sacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint. Manipulation of a dysfunctional sacro-iliac joint where the innominate bone is posteriorized using the Chicago technique, so called as it was developed by the Chicago School of Osteopathy USA. This belt wraps around the hips to hold the sacroiliac joint tightly together, which may ease your pain. It also arises from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament). A few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. It lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. In the human body, the lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments is a pair of ligaments stretching from the lower lateral angles of the sacrum to the transverse processes of the first coccygeal vertebra. the joint between the sacrum and the coccyx. They complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve There are up to three lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments on either side of the sacral hiatus. The pelvic ring is composed of two innominate bones and the sacrum. The innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual. Additional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3. The unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function. Loading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading. Primary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle. The ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction. Vleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver. After loading, the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, but posterior to the acetabula causing a posterior pelvic rotation and creating a dynamic, balanced tension on the pelvic ligaments. The sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to injury through minor and major trauma with an anterior shift in the line of gravity causing an anterior rotation of the innominate bones on the sacrum with a reversible subluxation and fixation. The opposing forces created when the ligaments are loaded create a force couple. The weight of the superincumbent trunk anterior to the oblique sacral axis at S3 on the left causes a sacral movement anteriorly at S1 on the left and posteriorly at S3 on the right just as soon as the normal axis on the symmetric pelvis begins to move into asymmetry. The sacrotuberous ligament is helical and allows this movement. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus serves to assist and support the function of the sacrotuberous ligament in bringing the distal sacrum anteriorly and laterally as the sacrum moves from lateral flexion to its resting position when the pelvis moves to symmetry at mid-step. This is necessary because the superincumbent weight is all anterior to the sacral axis and the sacrotuberous ligament is on stretch. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus and the piriformis must act as prime movers on the sacroiliac joint when the pelvis is asymmetrical. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus also functions to pull the pelvis anteriorly over the loaded side until the leg is perpendicular at mid-step. Dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint will cause at least some dysfunction in all of these pelvic axes. Other than when loading and moving from recumbent to standing, normal sacral movement occurs during normal gait. When the pelvis moves obliquely to the line of travel in order to extend the length of the stride it moves from a position of symmetry into asymmetry. In this position the pelvic bone (innominate bone) on the side of the forward leg (the loading leg) rotates somewhat backward and downward on the sacrum while the pelvic bone on the side of the trailing leg rotates somewhat forward and upward. This movement on the sacrum causes the sacrum to flex laterally toward the side of loading. As the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, the sacrum then moves on that oblique axis to drive counter rotation of the trunk on the loading side in order to decrease the loading forces and protect the head of the femur. This is a controlled instability and it can only occur with movement in the sacroiliac joint. Many practitioners believe that the sacroiliac joint does not move more than just a few degrees. Most practitioners accept Sturesson's measurements as accurate, leading to the myth that the sacroiliac joint essentially has no movement and no important function. In order to view innominate movement on the oblique asymmetric pelvis it was necessary to have the front of the pelvis square to the camera, but oblique to the line of travel. Movement of the posterior superior iliac spines on the sacrum is obvious and much greater than reported. Clearly, there is ample movement at the sacroiliac joint and not minimal as is commonly believed. Sturesson did not have the pelvis in an oblique or asymmetrical position nor did he include counter rotation. Conclusion: The sacroiliac joint demonstrates ample movement during normal ambulation when the pelvis is oblique to the line of travel and with counter rotation to the right and left.\n\nQuestion: the joint between a coxal bone of the pelvis and the sacrum\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His record was broken by running back Chris Johnson with a time of 4.24 seconds in 2008. Holliday had self-reported running times as fast as 4.21, which seemed plausible given his extensive track background, and the fastest 100 m dash time of any football player in NCAA history. At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40-yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout. At the 2015 NFL Scouting Combine, Nelson had the fastest 40-yard dash with a time of 4.28 seconds, .04 seconds shy of the then-combine record of 4.24 seconds held then by Chris Johnson. Nelson was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the fifth round, 159th overall, of the 2015 NFL Draft. He finished his rookie year with 11 receptions for 299 yards and two touchdowns. He also had the second-best time in both the three-cone drill (7.33) and 20-yard shuttle (4.47). He performed 30 repetitions at 225 lb in the bench press, tied for fifth-best among offensive linemen.

It is generally oval or cylindrical in shape, with significantly fewer locules (seed compartments, usually only two) than standard round tomatoes and a generally higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing into paste. **Canker sores.Researchers theorize that lycopene—a powerful antioxidant—is the natural cancer-fighting agent in tomatoes. The best way to get lycopene is in tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato juice, and even ketchup. Lycopene is most concentrated in tomato paste. Tomatoes also contain a compound called chlorogenic acid, which may help guard against cancer by blocking the effects of certain environmental toxins—for instance, nitrosamines, cancer-causing compounds in tobacco smoke and cured meat. This may be partially responsible for tomatoes' protection against heart disease. 50% more lycopene is contained in a Crimson type of tomato vs. a regular tomato. ** An unidentified substance in tomatoes and tomato-based products can cause acid reflux, leading to indigestion and heartburn. – dip or dipping sauce is a common condiment for many types of food. ; List of common dips ; Paste – food paste is a semi-liquid colloidal suspension, emulsion, or aggregation used in food preparation or eaten directly as a spread. Pastes are often highly spicy or aromatic. ; List of food pastes ; Spread – foods that are literally spread, generally with a knife, onto bread, crackers, or other food products. ; List of spreads \n\nConsuming tomatoes and tomato products can provide several potential health benefits. While raw tomatoes contain lycopene, cooked tomatoes actually provide more lycopene per gram. To maximize the absorption of fat-soluble phytonutrients present in tomatoes, it is recommended to add a small amount of fat to your meal when consuming foods like tomatoes. Tomato juice concentrate is also a rich source of potassium, which can help decrease the risk of stroke. Additionally, tomatoes and other vegetables contribute to reducing oxidation when consumed with meals. Tomato products, such as paste, can be a healthy addition to family dinners by incorporating vegetables and providing essential nutrients. While tomatoes have not been found to suppress tumor cell growth in most cancers, the lycopene present in tomatoes may have a protective effect against prostate cancer and cervical cancer. It is important to note that cooking acidic foods like tomato sauce in an aluminum pot is not advised, as consuming aluminum has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nQuestion: whats the difference between tomato paste and tomato puree\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Iceland hotspot is a hotspot which is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the Iceland Plateau and the island of Iceland. About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions. Iceland's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart, is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity, but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts, with peaks below sea level. In geological terms, Iceland is a young island. It started to form in the Miocene era about 20 million years ago from a series of volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it lies between the North American and Eurasian plates. The volcanic activity is attributed to a hotspot, the Iceland hotspot, which in turn lies over a mantle plume (the Iceland Plume) an anomalously hot rock in the Earth's mantle which is likely to be partly responsible for the island's creation and continued existence.\n\nQuestion: what type of plate boundary is associated with iceland and its volcanic eruptions\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of 1+1/2 mi. ; 1814 - George Stephenson constructs his first locomotive, Blücher for the Killingworth wagonway.

France also declared war on Germany later the same day. The state of war was announced to the British public in an 11 AM radio broadcast by the prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Although Britain and France honoured these guarantees by declaring war two days after Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \"Phoney War\". Further, neither the British Empire nor the French ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (16 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West). On 3 September 1939, Britain and France, which were allied with Poland, declared war on Germany. The British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. At last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.

METHODS: A multivariate equation incorporating prior student academic performance was used to model performance of those classes on the USMLE Step 1 examination. This model was used prospectively for the 76 members of the class of 2018 to develop a predicted USMLE score for each student. The model incorporated course grades while in medical school, performance on 4 NBME subject exams (physiology, microbiology, pathophysiology and pathology), and a NBME Comprehensive Basic Science Examination. PURPOSE: To assess the growth of professionalism, communication, organizational efficiency and oral presentations and entrustable professional activities (EPAs) during clinical clerkships employing direct observations in a standardized setting of medical students’ clinical encounters with real patients. We adapted the mini-CEX for use in the direct observation of third year clerkship students to assess medical competence. A two-facet fully crossed generalizability analysis (assessors x students) resulted in an Ep2 = .78. There was an increase in the means of professionalism, communication, organizational efficiency and oral presentations over time (p < .01) as theoretically expected. The mean increase in the overall assessment results in a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.87); growth followed an expected power curve (Thurstone Function). On average, entrustability was achieved at 15 days for professionalism, 32 for communication, 95 for organizational efficiency, and 100 for oral presentation. The Pathways of Human Metabolism (PHM) metabolic map, designed by medical educators at Stanford and vetted and approved by the Association of Biochemistry Educators (ABE), is a reference for learning and assessment that promotes a shift away from rote memorization. In July 2016, the NBME convened a Task Force to explore incorporation of this reference into the USMLE. METHODS: Task Force members, including biochemistry and clinician educators, experienced National Board item writers, and NBME staff, 1) debated benefits and challenges to use of the map on the USMLE, 2) worked in pairs to create and critique new USMLE-style items that depend on skillful utilization of the map, and 3) reviewed existing items to determine the impact access to a reference map might have. RESULTS: The Task Force identified a robust rationale for inclusion of reference material in general, and for including the PHM map specifically on USMLE. The group also identified risks and possible unintended consequences for medical education and learning. We encourage other basic science education organizations to identify similar discipline-based reference materials. Future communication strategies and research should be directed at ensuring that inclusion of such reference materials results in the desired changes in student behaviors, perceptions and performance. Assess a student’s ability to manage a random case (much like they would experience on their rotation). Identify growth opportunities for students using formative feedback just prior to beginning their Clerkships. Students were blind to both cases, one fixed across all four days, and the other randomized. All clinicians and standardized patients received training on providing formative feedback to the students. At the end of each session, students were provided immediate feedback by a clinician or a standardized patient. PURPOSE: Judgments about the importance of basic science to clinical medicine may reflect the degree to which individuals’ basic science knowledge is encapsulated. Initial attempts to create learning objectives for these concepts failed. Often, basic scientists wrote detailed learning objectives that lacked clinical applications while clinicians wrote objectives without apparent basic science underpinnings. A template evolved over more than a year of collaboration that gathers information from each “side” in an alternating step-wise fashion: core basic science concept, relevant common/core conditions, clinical decision area and discipline(s), basic science teaching point, and clinical harm statement. We hypothesized that students would benefit both academically and emotionally from this experience. METHODS: Medical students beginning their third year were introduced to a simulated patient who subsequently experienced cardiac arrest, underwent a simulated code, and died. Students wrote a one-word reflection to summarize their initial reaction, followed by a large group debrief with a panel of critical care, palliative care, psychiatry, and spiritual care faculty. Future directions include a follow up survey of the third year students, now nine months into clerkship, to assess lasting impact. PURPOSE: To increase deep learning, medical programs are incorporating student engagement and active learning strategies linked with higher-order assessments within pre-clerkship curricula. METHODS: The morning program comprised seven 30-minute talks by Neurosurgeons on topics ranging from a retrospective of the Neurosurgical field to novel surgical techniques currently employed. Attendance was assessed with an ExamSoft quiz. Each talk was attended by ~40% of the class while workshop station attendance ranged from 18 to 56%. CONCLUSION: Although the conference was not intended to produce neurosurgeons, the students’ attendance and quiz responses indicated that the program was appreciated as integral to their education. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Personal safety, travel logistics, cultural competency and ethics were commonly cited topics. The content, time spent, and format of the programs vary widely. METHODS: A battery of five previously validated survey instruments were used to evaluate learning motivations (intrinsic motivation, performance approach, performance avoidance, task value, grit, anxiety, self-efficacy, control of learning beliefs, theory of intelligence) and strategies (rehearsal, elaboration, critical thinking, organization, metacognitive self regulation, time and study environment management, effort, procrastination) across five class years of medical students at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (221 students evaluated in total). The “learning profiles” generated were then compared to other learning profiles in the literature. RESULTS: Several motivational factors (intrinsic motivation, performance approach, fear of failure, task value) decrease significantly between the first and second years of medical school and stabilize somewhat during the third and fourth years. Medical students also have higher intrinsic motivation, fear of failure, task value, and test anxiety than college students, but do not have higher self-efficacy or performance approach. Medical students have higher grit than all populations of comparison except for West Point Cadets. All higher-order learning strategies were significantly higher in medical students than in college students. CONCLUSION: During the first year of medical school, medical students lose motivation but maintain stable learning strategies, which are superior to those utilized by college students. However, medical students also display more anxiety and fear of failure than do college students. PURPOSE: Directly contacting a faculty member with questions is a valuable resource for students when faced with a challenging concept. However the student contacting the faculty member is the sole benefactor of that interaction while other students may continue to struggle with the same concept. METHODS: The organization has operated for three years. These views have arisen from the United States (54%), India (7%), United Kingdom (3.5%), Australia (2.4%) and a number of other countries. This process may be a valuable approach for other institutions. PURPOSE: Many medical schools employ collaborative learning activities. These methods promote active, deep learning while encouraging team development, both of which are necessary clinical skills. CONCLUSION: Our first year medical students in gross anatomy have historically been assessed via traditional laboratory practicals. This technique may be effective for enhancing the learning potential of a gross anatomy laboratory practical. PURPOSE: An integrated Foundational Science course was developed using principles of cognitive load theory. METHODS: We implemented Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in the design of an integrated Foundational Science course. Each lecture and LU was accompanied by a “study guide” – a faculty developed concept map illustrating key concepts. The predicted mean on the midterm assessment was 71% and actual performance by students in the MD class (154 students) was 89.8% (SD 6.3). On the final assessment, the predicted mean was 74%, and the actual mean was 89.4% (SD 6.6). Of course, one weakness of this study is that it lacks a true control group. METHODS: ICDs begin with a lecture that explicitly integrates biochemistry with disease, followed by discussion with a patient, their family, the healthcare team, and M1 students. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA. Comments were analyzed qualitatively with Atlas-Ti. Student comments (N=464) fit into five categories (a)clinical usefulness of basic science (b)intrinsic motivation (c)affirming passion to be in medicine (d)empathy and (e)generic positive comments. ICDs reaffirm students’ professional identity and intrinsic motivation given their limited clinical exposure in the first year of medical school. PURPOSE: Identifying patients at high risk of harming themselves and/or others is a crucial skill for all physicians, regardless of specialty. This abstract describes a novel 3-hour exercise using role play between medical students and advanced psychiatric residents to teach undergraduate medical students suicide and violence risk assessment skills. METHODS: This activity has been included in the 2nd year integrated behavioral neuroscience course at the University of Utah for the past 5 years. Next students participated in a 20-minute didactic session and performed 2 simulated interviews with faculty, each followed by 10 minutes of formative feedback. PURPOSE: Internet addiction is a mounting social issue of the 21st century affecting millions worldwide. Its ability to induce neurological and psychological disturbances, social phobia, cognitive biases and executive functioning deficits, has attracted significant attention from sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and educators worldwide. METHODS: The study identified Internet addicts in a population of students enrolled in a medical school preparatory program, using a standard eight-item Internet addiction test (IAT). Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests were used to verify effects and associations between the different variables. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors underlying students’ Internet addictive behavior and to analyze the effects of excessive Internet usage on their academic performance and study skills. RESULTS: 17% of the subjects met the criteria for Internet addicts. Age and time spent on the Internet per day were identified as predictors underlying students’ addictive Internet usage. Internet addiction had significant negative impact on students’ academic performance and study skills. A significant preliminary association between Internet addiction and students’ self-reported depression was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study helps establish evidences supporting the negative impact of Internet overuse on academic performance and study skills of students enrolled in premedical education. It highlights that the Internet, when abused by students enrolled in demanding curriculums related to medical education, can lead to poor academic performance and often academic failure. This information could guide their studying for the USMLE Step 1 exam. METHODS: MCW course directors coded exam questions relative to the USMLE content outline and competencies. A one-page instructional handout was tested with a pilot cohort of six. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot student reactions ranged from extremely positive to an expressive fear of looking at the analysis by category. They agreed that this data could shape an M2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\’s Step 1 study plan, concentrating on the categories marked as needing improvement (indicated on the report with a red check mark). Lessons Learned: 1) Start small. We need to audit each assessment on a regular basis to ensure that new questions are tagged. METHODS: This presentation is for medical science educators, along with instructional design, evaluation, and assessment specialists who are involved in supporting faculty through new or ongoing curriculum development. CONCLUSIONS: This presentation highlights the complex relationship between faculty and curriculum support. Why should we be concerned with the burden of fitting ECE in pre-clerkship training? Student reflections validate that legitimate ECE reinforce clinical skills learned in the classroom, convey meaning to their classroom learning, model early professional identity formation, and help counter burnout. Conclusions: Legitimate, elective ECE offer pre-clerkship students opportunities to bring classroom work to life, prevent burnout, and foster professional identity formation. METHODS: A variety of pharmacology topics were converted to games for review of material in two pharmacology courses annually. Games were primarily used for review of material rather than attainment of new knowledge. Adapted games included Behavioral Medicine Clue, Antibiotic Life-Sized Candyland, Antibiotic Trivial Pursuit, Antiepileptic Apples to Apples, as well as Catch Phrase and Hedbanz which encompassed several classes of medications. Students were surveyed at the end of the pharmacology courses regarding their demographics, impression of the games, the impact of the games on their learning, and which game formats they preferred. The students were neutral in whether they felt this method improved their test scores. Further study is ongoing and aimed at determining potential for improvement in test scores, motivation to learn, and delivery of new content via a game format. Lessons learned include timing, useful game formats, and student preferences for learning. Through hands on training students learn to manipulate images using Osirix DICOM software and annotate structures relevant to each anatomy lab session. How personal health information on images is handled is assessed during an introductory session. PURPOSE: Recently, a flipped classroom model was adopted for the physiology course in the OU-Tulsa PA Program. For each session, students watch a video lecture before class, take an in-class quiz on lower-order objectives, and then work in teams on application problems. Objective measures were needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped approach. This study describes a comparison of exam scores between offerings of the course when the teaching mode switched from a traditional lecture to a flipped classroom model. METHODS: Performance on eight exams was compared between traditional (n = 26 students) and flipped (n = 26 students) offerings of the course. Exam scores were not normally distributed, so a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine significant differences in median scores. Last, Cohen’s d effect sizes were determined for each exam comparison. CONCLUSION: This comparative analysis of exam performance between traditional lecture and flipped classroom offerings of a physiology course suggests the flipped model may lead to improvement on some exams. The sample size of both cohorts was a major limitation and resulted in use of more stringent statistical methods. Comparisons involving larger class sizes should more clearly assess any exam performance gains when teaching with a flipped classroom method. PURPOSE: One key competence for medical doctors is successful action in complex medical situations. Reflection is known to be an efficient way to identify gaps between challenge and performance. LIMETTE´s infrastructure enables medical educators to conduct competency assessment based on spontaneous behavior defined in entrustable professional activities (EPAs). 24 students per hour enter a circuit containing 6-12 subsequent rooms concentrically arranged around a central point. The assessment is carried out from that central point by observers via two-way mirrors and live recordings based on EPAs. Scenarios are recorded. LIMETTE-circuit settings allow a student-examiner ratio from 4:1 to 12:1. In a subsequent seminar, students discuss their experiences and ask questions based on their summarized results. CONCLUSION: The LIMETTE concept is a powerful option to evaluate the exact level of individual student’s skills, to identify gaps and to feedback observations and learning goals. During their first day (“early”) and final week (“late”) in the GITC, teams were evaluated on their IP teamwork, roles, and patient care plans using the SPEER rubric. Students evaluated their team dynamic and the faculty indirectly observed the encounter via a live-feed video system and completed the SPEER. All discussed their findings at the end of the encounter. ICCAS and SPEER progression was tracked throughout the GITC experience. CONCLUSIONS: This assessment instrument permitted a form of individualised assessment. This instrument should be considered for use in assessment of PBL and other group thinking activities. Each module included pre and post tests, instructor’s narrative, labeled microscopic images, links to virtual images, interactive activities, examples of related diseases, photo album, clinical correlations, definitions, cases to foster critical thinking, a Score Center to collect responses and a student evaluation. Purpose: There is limited data existing to evaluate the effectiveness of ARS (Audience Response System) in medical school education and assessment. The aim of this project is to examine the usefulness of a novel web based tool Mentimeter®, a collaborative and interactive ARS, in preparing first-year medical students for basic science exams. We hypothesize that Mentimeter® will have a significant effect on student preparedness for basic science exams and could tremendously improve retention of difficult conceptual knowledge. Approach/Methods: An IRB approved survey was conducted after students completed their first informal assessment (using Mentimeter®) before taking their first physiology progress exam. After the session, students were asked to rate statements on a Likert scale, with 0 representing “strongly disagree” and 5 representing “strongly agree”. Significance: We hypothesize the effect of Mentimeter® will be significant with respect to student preparedness for basic science exams, and could tremendously improve retention of basic science knowledge. It engages students by assigning them an avatar, and awards points based on accuracy and speed of answers submitted. It can be accessed on any device and minimal preparation is required to formulate the assessments. Conclusion: Taken together we have demonstrated the usefulness and high satisfaction of using Mentimeter® , a novel tool that can enhance learning in medical school curricula and encourage faculty to explore and incorporate these new tools in their course assessment and evaluation. METHODS: We have undertaken a modular approach for creating Histology NAVs. Fifty-eight short (generally < 5 min) NAVs have been created to describe elements of each tissue present in a particular organ. Statistical tracking of learner access to our NAV server is monitored throughout their instruction, and a single Histology examination is carried out upon completion. PURPOSE: Medical school instructors face a challenge in covering a high volume of material with often too-little instructional time. Unfortunately, the high volume of material in medical school often means that not all concepts will be sufficiently communicated and understood. While the prospect of simply shifting course material out of instructional time towards online formats is tempting, it is a zero-sum game–medical students still will grapple with overwhelming volumes of information and challenging concepts. In a first-year medical physiology course–which can be highly conceptual and require multiple iterations of cognitive modeling–we have sought to develop an algorithm that uses Educreations® technology to help large groups of students form and prune cognitive models via cognitive apprenticeship. CONCLUSION: With many medical schools striving to incorporate technology in their curriculum and few publishing their trials and results, we hope that our work will encourage other medical educators to ground their work in pedagogical theory and formally evaluate their technological implementations. We believe the strength of our student-feedback-driven algorithm is the digitilization of cognitive apprenticeship in a manner that is effective in reaching a large group of students. Students with reading deficits often use various methods and tools to help them review material and improve their reading skills. Some commonly used methods and tools include tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers. Tape recorders are beneficial for students with reading deficits as they allow for the recording of lectures or class discussions. This enables the students to review the material at their own pace, replaying the recordings as needed. By using tape recorders, students can focus on understanding the content without the pressure of keeping up with the reading or taking notes simultaneously. Tutorial aids are another helpful resource for students with reading deficits. These aids can include visual aids, such as charts, diagrams, or illustrations, that help visualize and simplify complex information. Additionally, tutorial aids may include step-by-step guides or summaries that provide a concise overview of the material. These aids serve as valuable supplements to the reading material and facilitate comprehension for students with reading difficulties. Laptop computers are also commonly used by students with reading deficits. For example, text-to-speech software can read the written content aloud, allowing students to follow along and listen to the text. Similarly, speech-to-text software enables students to dictate their responses or ideas, reducing the reliance on writing skills. These technological tools provide alternative ways for students to engage with and process information. It is important to note that the Orton phonologic method has been widely used for individuals with reading deficits. This method focuses on teaching phonemic awareness and phonics skills, aiming to improve reading and decoding abilities. While the Orton phonologic method has been effective for many individuals, it's crucial to consider individualized approaches and interventions based on each student's specific needs and learning style. In conclusion, students with reading deficits utilize various methods and tools such as tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers to review material and improve their reading skills. These resources offer alternative ways to access and understand information, catering to individual needs and enhancing learning outcomes. While Cornell students are no stranger to such activities as streaking, screaming before finals, or flash mobs, other impromptu activities are more specific to Cornell and its unique terrain: Traying down Libe Slope: After a fresh snowfall, undergraduates have been known to smuggle trays from the dining options in Willard Straight Hall or from the dormitory dining halls and use them to sled down Cornell's dramatic Libe Slope, a 100-foot hill stretching from Cornell West Campus to Uris Library, the undergraduate home of the Cornell University Library.\n\nQuestion: who invented the cornell method of note taking\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Neil\", which King recorded and released as a single the same year. The B-side contained the Goffin-King song \"A Very Special Boy\". After writing the Shirelles' Billboard Hot 100 number 1 hit \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\", the first No.1 hit by a black girl group, Goffin and King gave up their daytime jobs to concentrate on writing. In Curtis W. Ellison's book, Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven (1995), he stated: \"In the early 1990s, when ambiguity in romantic relationships accompanies changing expectations for both men and women, this song demonstrates Dolly Parton's appeal as a songwriter in the pop music market.\" Ken Knight, author of The Midnight Show: Late Night Cable-TV \"Guy-Flicks\" of the '80s (2008), commented that Parton is the only singer who can sing \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"make it memorable\". Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer, stating that the track was only written to \"soften the blow\" of Parton and Wagoner's split. Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" received widespread acclaim from music critics, being now regarded as her \"signature song\". Larry Flick of Billboard wrote that the song is \"bolstered by a remarkably restrained (and ultimately effective) vocal by Houston. Randy Clark of Cashbox noted that \"the unstoppable voice and unquestionable talent of Whitney Houston will no doubt come roaring back onto the charts with this cover\".

The book starts with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and covers the entire Second World War ending with the final surrender of Axis forces. World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. The war is in what will be known as the \"Second Period\", which starts after the fall of Wuhan in October 1938 and ends in December 1941 with Pearl Harbor. For events preceding September 1, 1939, see the timeline of events preceding World War II. Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later marks the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, western Europe saw very little land or air active military confrontation at first, and the period was termed the \"Phoney War\". World War II was the deadliest war in history which started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Following political instability built-up in Europe from 1930, Germany, which aimed to dominate Europe, attacked Poland on 1 september 1939 marking the official start of World War II.\n\nQuestion: when did world war 2 officially start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was set to music by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as \"that horrible little lamb – a poem that I hate\". It was also given a setting by Sir John Tavener, who explained: \"The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday.\" American poet Allen Ginsberg set the poem to music, along with several other of Blake's poems, in 1969 and was included on his album Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake.

Just as the U.S. has a \"Made in U.S.A.\" program, other countries support products made in their countries as well. A 2012 series of articles in Atlantic Magazine   highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the USA's manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the US, increasing US labor productivity, and union flexibility. New factories often: Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return. Companies such as ET Water Systems (now a Jain Irrigation Systems company), GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America. Advances in technology and automation such as 3D printing technologies have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States, both cost effective and possible.

It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of \n\n The Epistle to the Galatians says that, prior to his conversion, Paul was a Pharisee who \"violently persecuted\" the followers of Jesus. \"You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. Peter was aware that there were masters that were gentle and masters that were harsh; slaves in the latter situation were to make sure that their behaviour was beyond reproach, and if punished for doing right, to endure the suffering as Christ also endured it. The key theological text is Paul's declaration in Epistle to the Galatians (Galatians 3:28): \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\", suggesting that Christians \n\n A major theme of Paul's Epistle to the Romans is said to be that, so far as salvation is concerned, Jews and Gentiles are equal before God (2:7-12; 3:9-31;  4:9-12;  5:12,17-19;  9:24;  10:12-13;  11:30-32). A problem with this argument, however, is the context of Galatians 5. Line this up with Galatians 2, Galatians 2:21 in particular, which says \"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ \n\n Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire.

Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and \n\n Aeschylus (, ; Aiskhylos, ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, and is often described as the father of tragedy. Academic knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier Greek tragedy is largely based on inferences made from reading his surviving plays. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, Prometheus Bound, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion. His Oresteia is the only extant ancient example. Many authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred. Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who defined, in many ways, lyric poetry as a genre. A playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. In doing so, he essentially invented \"drama\": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex. Euripedes, conversely, used plays to challenge societal norms and mores—a hallmark of much of Western \n\n Seven against Thebes (Hepta epi Thebas) was performed in 467 BC. Another theme, with which Aeschylus' would continually involve himself, makes its first known appearance in this play, namely that the polis was a key development of human civilization. The play tells the story of Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of the shamed king of Thebes, Oedipus. But a new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices, and Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict.\n\nQuestion: who wrote antigone and what are the dates of his birth and death\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama proposed making community college tuition free to many residents of the US. Despite its popularity, the plan did not materialize. In September 2015, the College Promise Campaign was started, which serves to educate and promote College Promise programs in the United States. At that time, there were 53 College Promise Programs in place. By 2017, 16 states had at least one statewide College Promise program. A year later, the College Promise movement grew to over 300 programs in 24 states. As of September 2019, it was observed that there are over 320 College Promise Programs in 47 states nationwide. were wary of the student testing designed to ensure higher educational standards, and favored higher levels of federal spending on educational programs for minorities and the economically disadvantaged. Bush believed that educational costs should primarily be borne by state and local governments, and he did not favor dramatically raising the overall level of federal funding for education. Because of the lack of support from both liberals and conservatives, Congress did not act on his education proposals. Bush later introduced the voluntary \"America 2000\" program, which sought to rally business leaders and local governments around education reform. Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act.

Current RNs can enroll in RN-to-MSN programs, which allow RNs without bachelor's degrees to complete their master's in nursing. Every state requires nurses to earn RN licensure before practicing in their field. The NCLEX-RN serves prospective RNs, covering patient evaluations and care plans. To maintain current credentials, nurses must meet the renewal requirements.

Epic launched the title through a paid early access then, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. Following on the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of Fortnite called Fortnite Battle Royale, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile platforms. Fortnite Battle Royale quickly gained an audience, amassing over 125 million players by May 2018 with estimates of having earned over US$1 billion by July 2018 through microtransactions, including its battle pass system. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of Fortnite and released it as Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017. Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players.

In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. A simplified two-color version, introduced as Kinemacolor in 1908, was marginally successful for a few years, but the special projector it required and its inherent major technical defects contributed to its demise in 1914. Technicolor, originally also a two-color process capable of only a limited range of hues, was commercialized in 1922 and soon became the most widely used of the several two-color processes available in the 1920s. Beginning in 1932, Technicolor introduced a new full-color process, \"Process 4\", now commonly called \"three-strip Technicolor\" because the special camera used for live-action filming yielded separate black-and-white negatives for each of the three primary colors. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. The finished film print was projected, three frames at a time, through the corresponding color filters. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s.\n\nQuestion: when did movies start coming out in color\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dylan wrote all of the songs himself with the exception of \"Duquesne Whistle\", which he co-wrote with longtime Grateful Dead associate Robert Hunter. Tempest was Dylan's last album to feature original material until his 2020 album Rough and Rowdy Ways. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962. It has been described as a protest song and poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war, and freedom.

The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information. Dendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. They connect the axon of one neuron to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron, forming synapses. Neurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons. In summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. They transmit information through electrical signals along the axon, receive signals through dendrites, and communicate with other neurons through synapses. This intricate system facilitates the transmission of various types of information, including sensory input and motor output, ultimately allowing for the functioning of the nervous system. Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch). Some of the functional properties of the brain include information processing, motor control, sensory perception, memory storage and retrieval, emotions, and cognitive functions. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. Neurons also form networks and systems within the brain. Overall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain. usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites.

Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia. As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters. In many cities bus service enjoys a legal monopoly, however some city governments have legalized bus competition due to pressure from consumers who desire lower prices and entrepreneurs that would like to provide them. Unlike a state-owned enterprise, the USPS lacks a transparent ownership structure and isn't subject to standard rules and norms that apply to commercial entities. Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years.

Until 2017, \"I've Got Friends\" was Manchester Orchestra's only top-10 chart success and their highest-charting song; this feat was bested by \"The Gold\", which reached No. \"I've Got Friends\" was used in multiple video game soundtracks, such as MLB 11: The Show and Dirt 3, as well as in the television show The Vampire Diaries. \"Friends in Low Places\" first entered the Hot Country Songs on August 18, 1990. 1, where it remained there for four weeks until it was knocked off by \"You Lie\" performed by Reba McEntire. By then, the song was already causing a stir.

Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage. By integrating fixed structures such as the root system and the main stem, plants provide a stable foundation and structural support. Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight. On the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition. The integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms. The stems can contain secretory canals with resin, or latex which is particularly common among the Cichorioideae. dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots. Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering.

In thick skin, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum is present between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. These processes form intercellular bridges with neighboring cells, contributing to the overall strength and integrity of the skin. In thick skin, such as the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum can be observed between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. From the basal layer to the outermost layer, the epidermis consists of keratinocytes that produce keratin, form intercellular bridges, and provide a water barrier. The epidermis also contains other cell types like melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells, which contribute to the skin's color, immune response, and sensory perception. Although the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis. Below the stratum corneum lies the viable epidermis. Below the epidermis lies the dermis, which is approximately one millimeter thick, 100 times the thickness of the stratum corneum. The dermis contains small vessels that distribute drugs into the systemic circulation and to regulate temperature, a system known as the skin's microcirculation. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker.It serves many important functions, including regulating body temperature, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and sensing painful and pleasant stimuli. Anything that interferes with skin function or causes changes in appearance can have important consequences for physical and mental health. Structure and Function\n\nThe skin has three layers—the epidermis, dermis, and fat layer (also called the subcutaneous layer). Epidermis: The epidermis is the relatively thin, tough, outer layer of the skin. Most of the cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. They originate from cells in the deepest layer of the epidermis called the basal layer. The outermost portion of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is relatively waterproof and, when undamaged, prevents most bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis (along with other layers of the skin) also protects the internal organs, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels against trauma. In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.Getting Under the Skin\n\nThe skin has three layers.Beneath the surface of the skin are nerves, nerve endings, glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels.The epidermis also contains Langerhans' cells, which are part of the skin's immune system.Although these cells help detect foreign substances and defend the body against infection, they also play a role in the development of skin allergies.\n\nQuestion: the outer layer of the skin that contains no blood or nerve supply is the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. \"Rehab\" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. Near the end of 1995, Psychedelic Furs splinter group Love Spit Love was approached by the music supervisor of the movie The Craft, who inquired if the band might record a cover of the Smiths' \"How Soon Is Now?\". After initial reluctance, the band recorded the song, and it was released as a single from the movie's soundtrack in 1996. The song went on to appear on Charmed: The Soundtrack (2003) and as a UK and Australian bonus track on Charmed: The Book of Shadows (2005). The song has since become a staple of '90s popular culture, and has been used in numerous media, including the movie trailer for Cruel Intentions, the film The Craft and the novel Eleanor & Park.

The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy. In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\" Turpin and Lucas had each been convicted in separate murders, and their executions were Canada's last before capital punishment was abolished. Among democratic countries around the world, all European (except Belarus) and Latin American states, many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and Timor Leste), and Canada have abolished capital punishment, while the majority of the United States, Guatemala, and most of the Caribbean as well as some democracies in Asia (e.g., Japan and India) and Africa (e.g., Botswana and Zambia) retain it.

In late 1937, Goodman's publicist, Wynn Nathanson, suggested that Goodman and his band should play Carnegie Hall in New York City. \"Benny Goodman was initially hesitant about the concert, fearing for the worst; however, when his film Hollywood Hotel opened to rave reviews and giant lines, he threw himself into the work. He gave up several dates and insisted on holding rehearsals inside Carnegie Hall to familiarize the band with the lively acoustics.\" The concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938.

Disdaining permanent leaders, hierarchical relationships and parliamentary procedure, the founders conceived of the organization as a broad exercise in \"participatory democracy\". From its launch in 1960 it grew rapidly in the course of the tumultuous decade with over 300 campus chapters and 30,000 supporters recorded nationwide by its last national convention in 1969. A new national network for left-wing student organizing, also calling itself Students for a Democratic Society, was founded in 2006. In early 1968, the National Mobilization Committee opened a Chicago office directed by Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden, who were leading political organizers at the time and former leaders of Students for a Democratic Society. MOBE was run by a small executive board that set up a general framework for mass demonstrations, sent out invitations to the over 500 groups on its mailing lists, and coordinated \n\n As part of the wider anti-war movement of the 1960s, student organisations such as the Harvard chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) ran anti-war activities on campus. Fraternal Democrats was an international society, founded at a meeting held in London on September 22. Later they kept in constant touch with the Fraternal Democrats trying to influence the proletarian core of the society, which joined the Communist League in 1847, and through it the Chartist movement. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ross became engaged with political activism on behalf of progressive causes and emerged as a student leader.

The combustion process of petroleum, coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. For example, acid rain can kill trees, and can kill fish by acidifying lakes. It is an important gas that contributes to environmental concerns. This can have significant impacts on air quality and can contribute to the formation of acid rain. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and when these fossil fuels are burned, sulfur dioxide is released into the air. Industrial activities such as power generation, manufacturing, and transportation all contribute to sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to its direct health effects, sulfur dioxide plays a role in the formation of acid rain. When SO2 reacts with oxygen and other pollutants in the atmosphere, it can form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Interaction of and other  with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere can form acid rain which harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests. The major contributor to acid rain is not carbon monoxide. Acid rain is primarily caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. When SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which can then fall to the ground as acid rain. It is important for industries and individuals to take measures to reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of acid rain.\n\nQuestion: rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Early in 1483, the king and queen established a council, the Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición, to govern the inquisition and chose Torquemada to head it as inquisitor general. After the 1400s, few Spanish inquisitors were from the religious orders. The Spanish Inquisition was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the burning at the stake of many heretics. In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-fé in which an effigy of him was burned. Reina wrote the first great book against the Inquisition: Sanctae Inquisitionis hispanicae artes aliquot detectae, ac palam traductae (\"Some arts of Holy Inquisition\"). With the institution of the Roman Catholic Inquisition in Spain, and with the Dominican friar Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General, the Catholic Monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity. Though Isabella opposed taking harsh measures against Jews on economic grounds, Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand. Hundreds of those that remained came under the Inquisition's investigations into relapsed conversos (Marranos) and the Judaizers who had been abetting them. When Holy Office of the Inquisition had been established in New Spain in 1571, it exercised no jurisdiction over Indians, except for material printed in indigenous languages. Its first official Inquisitor was archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras, who established the \"Tribunal de la Fe\" (Tribunal of the Faith) in Mexico City.

In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day. States Capitol in favor of fellow Ponca Chief Standing Bear as setting the standard in representing Native Americans in the proper light, saying the non-partisan decision to honor a significant event in American history \"will help spread the story and better help all Americans to understand our story.” He advocates changing Columbus Day to Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In 2018, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed a law changing the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day; however, former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin vetoed that legislation claiming that \"combining a new Native American Day designation with the current Columbus Day holiday could be viewed as an intentional attempt to diminish \n\nSome Native Americans in the United States have had difficulty with the use of alcohol. Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress. Studies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach. Indian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA. Organizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services.

SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide. Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area. Native American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities. First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness. Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Alcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. From January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.

It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across Turtle Island (North America). In 1982, the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations) called for the creation of a National Aboriginal Solidarity Day to be celebrated on 21 June. Slightly more than a decade later in 1995, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that a National First Peoples Day be designated. Also in that same year, a national conference of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. 21 June often coincides with the summer solstice. National Indigenous Peoples Day is now the first of a series of Celebrate Canada days, followed by the National Holiday of Quebec on \n\n long-standing support of November being proclaimed annually as Native American Heritage Month.\" Chapman said Fallin's veto of a nonpartisan bill \"defied logic\" and was a slap in the face to Native Americans in Oklahoma to deny them a day to commemorate their unique history. Chapman was asked whether Americans should honor soldiers who fought not in defense of country, but to dispossess native peoples of their land and their lives.\n\nQuestion: what ethnic group celebrates its contribution to america in october\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid. These Games also saw karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of baseball and softball for the first time since 2008. This was the first Olympics since the June 2018 signing of the Prespa agreement between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia over the \"Macedonia\" naming dispute, resulting in the latter officially being renamed North Macedonia. As a result of the 2020 ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on the Russian doping scandal, Russian athletes compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee, and under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. Games with 113 medals, the most amongst all nations: 39 gold, 41 silver, and 33 bronze. Overall, the medal total was slightly lower than five years prior in Rio de Janeiro, where the United States won 46 gold and 121 total medals. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert. Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 606-nanometer wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes. Kr + F2 → KrF2 2 Kr + → 2 KrF 2 KrF → 2 Kr +  Like the other noble gases, krypton is chemically highly unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in the +2 oxidation state parallels that of the neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction it is difficult to oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states. Following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962, synthesis of krypton difluoride was reported in 1963. In the same year, was reported by Grosse, et al., but was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification. In the first phase, CCMR enabled the company to work with a Cornell Chemistry expert who synthesized the reagents necessary to conduct the assay. In a follow-up project, the company used CCMR’s high-resolution transmission electron microscope to study the size and detailed structure of the polymer nanoparticles, which contain the metal catalyst necessary for the signal amplification reaction. A startup focusing on commercializing biological assays to detect hard-to-discern infectious diseases developed a test using Raman spectroscopy with the help of CCMR experts. Using the CCMR Raman and the expertise of a Cornell Materials scientist, the company tested the effects of varying conditions and morphology of their nanostructured metal surfaces and the resulting enhancement of the Raman signal produced in presence of the molecule of interest. A leading local manufacturer of optics and accessories for IR-UV-VIS (infrared-ultraviolet-visible light) spectroscopy was partnered with a Cornell physics professor to develop a prototype shear/compression attachment that allows users of optical microscopes to examine biological tissues in response to applied forces. It partnered a small business, based in Lansing, NY, and a Cornell mechanical engineering professor to develop a safer alternative to the steel cables currently being used in rescue helicopters. The idea for the coating draws its inspiration from the miniscule ridges of lotus leaves, which prevent water from bonding and icing. A medium-size company has been partnered with two Cornell faculty members with expertise in fiber science and chemical engineering to use light- and stress-sensing dyes that will alter the appearance of its harnesses when the nylon it is made out of has been compromised by the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays or stress. Patches containing these UV-sensitive and stress sensing dyes for the company’s nylon safety harnesses will provide an immediate warning to the user. An energy-focused startup located in California collaborated with a Cornell chemical engineering expert to develop a scalable gas-assisted electrospinning manufacturing process for energy storage materials. Further optimization led to an electrospray process that could be used in nanocoatings, sensor-making, and many other applications, opening up a wide variety of markets for the startup. An established industry leader in vacuum coating with international partners in Europe, and Asia, developed a new physical vapor deposition (PVD) process to replace the toxic electroplated chromium coating process for applications on plastic substrates from automobiles to appliances. The semiconductor industry is developing smaller and smaller transistors, but is still unable to test quickly and efficiently their basic electrical and physical properties. The company, which began as a two-year CCMR funded project in the lab of an electrical engineering professor, is developing a scanning probe that enables testing and characterization of semiconductor materials at the nano-level. As a result of the CCMR funded projects, the company has been granted a 10-year tax abatement and secured funding from agencies such as NYSERDA, DARPA, and NSF to pursue the development of this innovative technology, an advancement that could save the semiconductor industry millions. A global manufacturer of amorphous metal used as core materials in energy-efficient power distribution transformers is poised to expand into new markets. The company is upgrading its rapid manufacturing techniques with the help of a Cornell chemical engineering professor. The newly developed proprietary process produces metal alloys with enhanced electromagnetic properties, paving the way for use of the company’s new alloys in structural applications in aerospace, a new target market. To overcome these technical challenges, the company partnered with a Cornell electrical engineer. A small company formed as a result of cutting-edge battery technology research with a Cornell electrochemistry professor approached the CCMR to scale-up production of its innovative anode material, necessary step to secure state and federal grants as well as venture capital financing. The mechanical properties of blocks of various compositions were analyzed and compared to industry standards. The multinational company, which is based in France, has been working with a Cornell chemistry professor for several years to develop the new technology, with the goal of decreasing its manufacturing costs, improving the durability and safety of its products, and allowing the company to rely less on fossil fuels. By working with a Cornell mechanical and aerospace engineering professor to conduct an in-depth analysis of the physical properties of its aerogel-based insulation, the company has been able to streamline the transport of temperature-sensitive goods by creating smaller packages that cost its customers less. Lacking in-house resources at this early stage, the company conducted all its research and development activities in the CCMR facilities in collaboration with a Cornell materials science expert. Their work culminated in the development of a single crystal solar cell substrate that can be rolled, streamlining the deployment and manufacture of solar cells. Through a process specifically designed to reduce stress in sputtered films, metal was deposited onto plastic substrates. The link between materials’ structure and their properties is of strong interest to multiple industry sectors manufacturers. A global company requested the help of the CCMR to optimize the mechanical performance of materials used in exterior and interior components of the automotive industry, its largest market. A Cornell chemist synthesized semi-crystalline polyolefins with specific microarchitectures that enhance their mechanical properties. Their electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties were analyzed resulting in the selection of the most appropriate composites for consumer electronics products. A world leader in filtration systems developed new materials for filtration membranes in collaboration with a Cornell materials science expert. At the completion of the project, the company will have a set of tools enabling the development of unique materials for specific targeted applications. A Kodak technology startup developing cerium-based nano-materials used the CCMR to fine-tune its process for producing catalysts used in diesel fuel additives, and to train its employees in advanced electron microscopy techniques and analysis. Employees, including a staff scientist, at the Rochester-based company, worked with an applied physics professor and an electron microscopy expert from Cornell to image, analyze and better understand the structure and composition of its materials. The level of detailed information the company learned about its very tiny particles during the training guided the refinement of its process techniques, allowing the company to produce a more efficient catalyst material—one that increases the efficiency of off-road engines by more than six percent. A NY State manufacturer of polishing pads for the semiconductor industry approached Cornell for assistance with a product improvement project. In partnership with a Cornell professor from Chemical Engineering, they identified the parameters affecting the performance of their polishing pads. The team developed new production procedures and in-house quality control measures, which helped the company manufacture higher quality products at a lower cost. Using CCMR’s imaging facilities, the company was able to validate new applications of its ultrathin membranes, which are used in molecular and nanoparticle separations, with help from a microscopy expert in applied and engineering physics. The company used this information to market its membranes as TEM windows and progressed quickly toward full production, marketing, and sales. An Ithaca-based manufacturer of tabletop plasma cleaners was partnered with a Cornell materials science and electrical engineering group, comprised of faculty and students, to analyze the performance of its products. The students working on this project continued as summer interns at the company. The high-performance analysis conducted at Cornel enabled the company to market a new line of plasma cleaners. The instruments available in the CCMR facilities are used by startups as well as by established businesses. A worldwide manufacturer of innovative and specialty glasses was able to work and train with an ultra-high resolution microscope at the CCMR facilities for three years before deciding to purchase one of its own. The company relied heavily on CCMR technical staff to justify the microscope purchase, which required an extremely large financial investment. CCMR staff was able to show the company that it could customize use of the microscope for its own needs. They helped the company develop and define procedures that fit its applications. The company decided then to purchase the microscope. Its collaboration with CCMR staff continues, for employees training and for the development of new procedures. to atoms other than fluorine have also been discovered. There are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a krypton oxoacid. ArKr+ and KrH+ polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for KrXe or KrXe+. The reaction of with  produces an unstable compound,, that contains a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation [HC≡N–Kr–F], produced by the reaction of with [HC≡NH][AsF] below −50 °C. HKrCN and HKrC≡CH (krypton hydride-cyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene) were reported to be stable up to 40 K. Krypton hydride (Kr(H2)4) crystals can be grown at pressures above 5 GPa. They have a face-centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules. Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton. In 1960, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures defined the meter as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light emitted by the krypton-86 isotope. This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1 Å = 10−10 m. The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.\n\nQuestion: element named after fictional planet from which superman came\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart. The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. As the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. Once the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. the main function of the pulmonary system. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.The contraction of the left ventricle propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.)\n\nQuestion: where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Initially, he was producing postcards under contract for W. J. Nigh & Sons Ltd, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. From 1937 (evidenced by a postmark on a colour tinted photo card of Shanklin Old Village) he was producing postcards on his own account. Cards with messages have been sporadically created and posted by individuals since the beginning of postal services. The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750. In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as \"Lipman's Postal Card\". These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability. The origin of modern trading cards is associated with cigarette cards first issued by the US-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company in 1875. They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards. On March 1, 1907, Federal legislation permitted senders, for the first time, to include a message on a portion of the back of a postcard. His best known work involved the designing of Christmas cards for UNICEF and the New York Graphic Society, which gave him international recognition. The cards were designed starting in 1963 and achieved record sales for the United Nations’ children's\n\nQuestion: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Metallic zinc is the core of all United States currency coins, including copper-coated pennies. People who ingest a large number of coins will have elevated zinc levels, leading to zinc-toxicity-induced copper deficiency and the associated neurological symptoms. The United States Mint has issued legal tender coins every year from 1792 to the present. From 1934 to the present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar. The last gold coins were minted in 1933. Once striking began, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint modified the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. In contrast the United States has minted over 300 billion pennies since 1983 when the current copper-plated zinc metallic composition began.\n\nQuestion: when did they start adding zinc to pennies\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping Æsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, According to a Demoskop study in 2015 about the beliefs of the Swedish showed that Sociology professor Phil Zuckerman claims that Swedes, despite a lack of belief in God, commonly question the term atheist, preferring to call themselves Christians while being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden. Religion continues to play a role in Swedish cultural identity. This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of Swedish adults continue to remain members of the Lutheran Church despite having to pay a church tax; moreover, rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing in Sweden. With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including Judaism and Roman Catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination. At the end of 2018, 57.7% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden; this number had been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the previous 7 years and one percentage point a year on average for the previous two decades. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various Evangelical Protestant free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden. The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of Tatars migrated from Finland. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from the Balkans and Turkey.\n\nQuestion: what is the most popular religion in sweden\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) on the shores of Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, Germany, and was operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. The airship flew from March 1936 until it was destroyed by fire 14 months later on May 6, 1937 while attempting to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Manchester Township, New Jersey, at the end of the first North American transatlantic journey of her second season of service. He was severely burned when the ship caught fire at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937, and died the following day.

In terms of composition, the interstitial fluid consists of various substances that are necessary for the functioning of cells and tissues. It contains nutrients, oxygen, hormones, electrolytes, and waste products. These substances are exchanged between the blood and the cells through the capillary walls. The interstitial fluid compartment is approximately 12 liters in volume, while the total ECF compartment is around 14-15 liters. It's important to note that the interstitial fluid compartment is further divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment and the transcellular fluid compartment. To summarize, the interstitial fluid compartment is an essential component of the extracellular fluid compartment. It contains nutrients, oxygen, and waste products that are exchanged between the blood and the cells. Understanding the composition and dynamics of the interstitial fluid is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and overall health. In lean healthy adult men, the total body water is about 60% (60–67%) of the total body weight; it is usually slightly lower in women (52-55%). The exact percentage of fluid relative to body weight is inversely proportional to the percentage of body fat. The total body of water is divided into fluid compartments, between the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment (also called space, or volume) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (space, volume) in a two-to-one ratio: 28 (28–32) liters are inside cells and 14 (14–15) liters are outside cells. The fluids associated with the human body include air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, solvents, solutions, suspensions, serum, lymph, and blood. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. ; Immune system: protects the organism from foreign bodies. **Solutes** are the particles dissolved or suspended in the water.The **solvent** is the water portion of fluids.This water (fluid) is divided into two main spaces or compartments—the fluid outside the cells, which is the **extracellular fluid (ECF)** ; and the fluid inside the cells, which is the **intracellular fluid (ICF). ** The ECF space contains about one third (about 15 L) of the total body water. **Transcellular fluids** are the fluids in special body spaces and include cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid. In the healthy adult, the volume of water in the fluid compartments remains within the normal range although the water moves constantly between compartments. _For proper function, the volume of all body fluids and the types and amount of dissolved substances must be carefully balanced._\n\n# Anatomy and Physiology Review\n\n## Physiologic Influences on Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n\nBody fluids are composed of water and particles dissolved or suspended in water. Solutes vary in type and amount from one fluid space to another.Body function depends on keeping the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes within each body fluid space.Three processes are important to control normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and they work together to maintain balance so the internal environment remains stable even when the external environment changes.These processes are filtration, diffusion, and osmosis.\n\nQuestion: what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Napoleon was a French military leader who rose to power during the French Revolution and who, in 1804, transformed the First French Republic into the First French Empire, five years after his coup d'état of November 1799 (18 Brumaire). Napoleon and the Grande Armée had to fight against every major European power (except for the ones he was allied with, including Denmark-Norway) and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man.\n\nQuestion: what emperor took over france after the reign of terror\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Robbins was the only artist with more than one chart-topper on the juke box listing, and his total \n\n The album's title track, \"Coat of Many Colors\", tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes,\" rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags. Parton was honored in 2003 with a tribute album called Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton. The artists who recorded versions of Parton's songs included Melissa Etheridge (\"I Will Always Love You\"), Alison Krauss (\"9 to 5\"), Shania Twain (\"Coat of Many Colors\"), Meshell Ndegeocello (\"Two Doors Down\"), Norah Jones (\"The Grass is Blue\"), and Sinéad O'Connor (\"Dagger Through the Heart\"). Parton herself contributed a re-recording of the title song, originally the title song for her first RCA album in 1968.

Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Mongillo tweeted that playing Shinji was \"one of the greatest honors of my life\". Noel Kirkpatrick of TV Guide praised Mongillo's portrayal of Shinji, saying they excelled at switching \"between sarcasm and sadness, delight and detachment\", and that they did \"a better job of capturing Shinji's pre-teen voice\" than Spencer. Aja Romano of Vox wrote that it was laudable that Netflix cast a non-binary actor to play Shinji. Carol Grant, in an opinion piece for Vice, wrote that Shinji being played by a trans actor made the series feel more queer, saying that \"Mongillo's delivery captures the delicate interplay between the masculine and feminine aspects of Shinji's voice and personality, bringing his bodily and gendered anxieties to life\".

In Robert Herrick's Hesperides, a book of poems published in 1648,. there were three revealing poems An Hymne to Love, The Dream, and To Love which showcase masculine longing for domination, restraint, discipline. Isabella Whitney's 16th-century poem \"To her Inconstant Lover\" is the first in her first book The Copy of a Letter, Lately Written in Meter by a Young Gentlewoman: to her Unconstant Lover (1567). The speaker is Whitney herself, who is, as the title of the poem indicates, writing to her unfaithful, or inconstant lover. Whitney begins by telling her lover that she has learned he is going to be married, despite his trying this a secret, which the first line explains: \"as close as you your wedding kept\". Whitney alternates between speaking as the jilted lover, reminding him what he is missing out on by abandoning her, or acting somewhat as a counsellor and \n\n long as I pull on his sinew, Contents and pleases me. As Kłosowska describes, this sonnet participates in the tradition of courtly erotic joke making in which erotic meaning lies under the thin pretense of non-erotic solution; however, l'Aubespine's appropriation of the genre complicates the traditional gender standards of the time, because her sonnet is woman-centered and outlines mutual sexual gratification. In Pope's poem, Eloisa confesses to the suppressed love that his letter has reawakened. Linda Wagner-Martin comments that Plath often criticised the hegemony to only see women as mothers and motherly beings rather than focussing on the work they produced and other qualities that would otherwise give them substance. Poems such as \"Morning Song\" detail Plath's struggle with motherhood and how, because of the social pressure to instantly love your child and neglect to acknowledge illnesses such as postpartum depression, she struggled with motherhood.

Three Vikings scored eight touchdowns: running back Latavius Murray, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and tight end Kyle Rudolph.

New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle. The crystallized magma forms a new crust of basalt known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt, and gabbro below it in the lower oceanic crust. Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic \n\n Ocean crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is removed by subduction. Mid-ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. Mafic melts generally flow over the surface of the Earth and form layers (i.e. Columbia River Basalt). This pressure squeezes water out of the plate and introduces it to the mantle. Here the mantle melts and forms magma at depth under the overriding plate. These should not be confused with hotspot volcanic chains, where volcanoes often form one after another in the middle of a tectonic plate, as the plate moves over the \n\n Geologic tension is also found in the tectonic regions of divergent boundaries. Here, a magma chamber forms underneath oceanic crust and causes sea-floor spreading in the creation of new oceanic crust. Some of the force that pushes the two plates apart is due to ridge push force of the magma chamber.

Financial management is an essential aspect of healthcare management. Financial management ensures that healthcare organizations can sustain their operations, invest in necessary resources, and provide cost-effective care. It also involves managing reimbursement systems, negotiating contracts with insurance providers, and addressing financial challenges. Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfill the goals of an organization.

It may apply both to tangible assets (physical objects such as buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as human capital, intellectual property, goodwill or financial assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks and performance attributes). The term is commonly used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. They monitor the performance of the investment portfolio and make adjustments to the mix of securities, bonds, and other assets when necessary. By working towards producing an above-average return on investments, a money manager aims to optimize the financial resources of the healthcare facility. Even a small improvement in average performance can have a significant impact on the overall contribution costs or benefits of the organization. The expertise of a money manager benefits the organization's investment portfolio in several ways. This helps in diversifying the portfolio and managing risk effectively. They keep track of market fluctuations, analyze the portfolio's returns, and recommend adjustments to ensure that the funds remain on track to meet the organization's financial objectives. Overall, the role of a money manager is vital in maximizing the returns on investments for healthcare facilities.

The signer or presenter of the check, or person who prints and authorizes the check. In U.S. law, in Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in most U.S. State statutes, a check is an order (as opposed to a promise) to pay a fixed amount of money, according to §3-104(a). §3-104(f) specifies that '''\"Check\" means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank; or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check. §3-103(a)(3) specifies that \"Drawer\" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment. Cashiers have lost their jobs to cash overages/shortages, either for repeated violations or for large overages or shortages. Counting the money is usually done in the back office: the drawer is removed from the register and taken into the office.

The driver of the car, Bernard Beckett, pleaded guilty to the gun charges. He came across Policemen Morgan and Simon, who bicycled to the house under Jesse's guidance. When Morgan entered the cellar and struck a match, he instantly realised that it was a case of murder–suicide. The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by a van driven by Stephanie, Lopes' personal assistant. Lopes paid approximately $3,700 for his medical expenses and funeral, and she gave the family around $925 for any extra costs, although \n\nIn the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service. From a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job. The vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable. The traffic accident was our first call. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing. Sarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. After she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. We took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department. From delivering babies to attending scenes where someone has died, she responds to a wide range of incidents, some of which require a great deal of emotional resilience. Talking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope. But she said incidents can affect people in different ways, and it is important to have your own coping mechanisms. Our next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. The man, who was alcohol-dependent and had cirrhosis of the liver, was known to the service. Sarah then explained how paramedics make a diagnosis of death. After completing the diagnosis of death form she contacted emergency services control to check when the police would arrive. All this happened before lunchtime, showing just how intense and varied the life of a paramedic can be. In the afternoon we were called to a GP surgery to take a patient with suspected atrial fibrillation to hospital, attended a minor kitchen fire in a block of flats and saw a patient with multiple sclerosis who said she was in pain. Sarah thought the patient’s presentation and body language did not indicate she was in great pain, so she suggested the patient talk to the mental health liaison team in the emergency department, and she agreed to come with us to the hospital. Paramedics are on the front line of emergency care. \"It is just such a tragic loss of young lives. Young kids out on a Saturday night to enjoy themselves and something like this happens.

The most well-known version of the song is the hit single by Sonny & Cher which, in 1971, reached No. Their album by the same title sold over 500,000 copies reaching RIAA gold status. \"All I Ever Need Is You\" by Sonny & Cher also topped the \n\n \"Whenever You Need Me\" is a song by British band T'Pau, released as the lead single from their 1991 third studio album The Promise. In the UK, a limited edition box-set of the single was issued, featuring the 12\" vinyl single and a life-size colour poster of Decker. The band also performed the song on the UK music show Top of the Pops, and the UK Saturday morning children show Gimme 5. Two versions made the country music charts: Ray Sanders (No. 18) in 1971, and Kenny Rogers and Dottie West (No. The Rogers and West recording was included on four albums: Classics in 1979 selling over 2,000,000 copies; Duets in 1984 selling over 1,000,000 copies; 42 Ultimate Hits in 2004 selling over 500,000 copies and 21 Number Ones in 2006 selling over 500,000 copies. In another interview with Billboard, he told about the story of the song and how it was put together: \"\"['I Just Need U'] started in a session writing for the band Finding Favour, but they said it wasn't for them. I Need Your Lovin' (also: \"Need Your Lovin'\") is a popular rhythm and blues song written by Bobby Robinson and Don Gardner.

This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary from very mild, characterized by small white areas in the enamel, to severe cases where teeth appear stained and pitted. While drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These additional sources include toothpastes, mouth rinses, fluoride supplements, fluoridated salt or milk, as well as locally applied dental gels, solutions, and varnishes. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis. It is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. Apart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure. In summary, while drinking water can contribute to fluoride exposure, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily due to excessive fluoride intake during tooth development from various sources. Monitoring fluoride intake during this period is crucial to prevent dental fluorosis. Dental fluorosis is a common disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. People with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage. An individual's fluorosis score is based on the most severe form of fluorosis found on two or more teeth. Causes\nDental fluorosis is caused by a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion whilst teeth are forming. The most superficial concern in dental fluorosis is aesthetic changes in the permanent dentition (the adult teeth). The period when these teeth are at highest risk of developing fluorosis is between when the child is born up to 6 years old, though there has been some research which proposes that the most crucial course is during the first 2 years of the child's life. From roughly 7 years old thereafter, most children's permanent teeth would have undergone complete development (except their wisdom teeth), and therefore their susceptibility to fluorosis is greatly reduced, or even insignificant, despite the amount of intake of fluoride. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the amount of fluoride exposure, the age of the child, individual response, weight, degree of physical activity, nutrition, and bone growth. Individual susceptibility to fluorosis is also influenced by genetic factors. The last of these sources is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of all fluorosis, but the resulting effect due to water fluoridation is largely and typically aesthetic. Dental fluorosis has been growing in the United States concurrent with fluoridation of municipal water supplies, although disproportionately by race. A 2010 CDC report acknowledges an overall incidence of dental fluorosis of 22% from 1986-87 increased to 41% in the early 21st century, with an increase in moderate to severe dental fluorosis from 1% to 4%. More than one in five American teens (23%) have moderate to severe dental fluorosis on at least two teeth. Mechanism\nTeeth are the most studied body tissues to examine the impact of fluoride to human health. Dental fluorosis can be prevented at a population level through defluoridation. It is the downward adjustment of the level of fluoride in drinking water. Management\nDental fluorosis may or may not be of cosmetic concern. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control found a 9 percentage point increase in the prevalence of confirmed dental fluorosis in a 1999-2002 study of American children and adolescents than was found in a similar survey from 1986-1987 (from 22.8% in 1986-1987 to 32% in 1999-2002). \"Your dentist, pediatrician or family physician can help you determine how to optimize your child’s fluoride intake.\" Prevention\nDental fluorosis can be prevented by lowering the amount of fluoride intake to below the tolerable upper limit. History\n\nIn ancient times, Galen describes what is thought to be dental fluorosis. The condition then started to become termed \"dental fluorosis\". As research continued, the protective effect of fluoride against dental decay was demonstrated. References\n\nExternal links \n\nDevelopmental tooth disorders\nToxic effects of dietary elements\n\n phosphate mineral. It is also present in human teeth that have been exposed to fluoride ions, for example, through water fluoridation or by using fluoride-containing toothpaste. The presence of fluorapatite helps prevent tooth decay or dental caries. Fluoroapatite has a critical pH of 4.5, thus it makes tooth structure more resistant to additional caries attack. It has a mild bacteriostatic property as well, which helps decrease the proliferation of Streptococcus mutans, the predominant bacterium related to dental caries. Mottled enamel, also known as dental fluorosis, is primarily caused by excessive exposure to fluoride during the development of teeth. Dental fluorosis occurs when high levels of fluoride are ingested during the tooth mineralization process, which usually occurs in childhood. While fluoride is beneficial for dental health in appropriate amounts, excessive intake can lead to the appearance of white or brown spots on the teeth. When children are exposed to excessive fluoride, it can result in the disruption of enamel formation, leading to the appearance of mottled enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary depending on the level of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that dental fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic condition and does not usually cause any functional problems or pain. However, in severe cases, the enamel may become pitted or rough, and teeth may be more prone to staining and decay. Prevention of dental fluorosis involves several measures, such as using fluoride-containing products in appropriate amounts, teaching children to practice proper oral hygiene, and monitoring their fluoride intake from multiple sources. Dentists can also provide guidance on fluoride supplementation or the use of alternative sources of drinking water if necessary. Implementing preventive measures and maintaining proper oral hygiene can help minimize the risk of dental fluorosis.\n\nQuestion: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These impulses are then transmitted through the fibers of the optic nerve to various visual centers in the brain. It consists of several layers of interconnected neurons and is supported by pigmented epithelial cells. The neural signals generated by the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. The output of these neurons takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These ganglion cells have axons that bundle together to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the electrical impulses generated by the retinal ganglion cells and transmits them to the brain. It is worth mentioning that the retina, including the optic nerve, is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. During vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon. Therefore, the optic nerve serves as a vital pathway through which visual information is transmitted from the retina to the brain, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the visual world. Ganglion cell layer: This layer contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. The ganglion cells send their axons towards the posterior of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the visual information to the brain for further processing and interpretation. These structures work together to capture, process, and transmit visual signals to the brain for perception. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, action potentials must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS. If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not \n\n The ganglion cell layer (ganglionic layer) is a layer of the retina that consists of retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells. The cells are somewhat flask-shaped; the rounded internal surface of each resting on the stratum opticum, and sending off an axon which is prolonged into it. The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer. The ganglion cells in the retina have an important function in processing visual information. Ganglion cells then transmit this visual information to the brain via their axons. The axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain. In terms of connectivity in the brain, the axons of ganglion cells primarily connect to a specific region called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Overall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation. Reference:\n- A ganglion cell (sometimes called a gangliocyte) is a type of neuron located in the retina of the eye that receives visual information from photoreceptors via various intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells. - These axons form the optic nerve and connect mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the brain.\n\nQuestion: ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The U.S. state of Georgia is known as the \"Peach State\" due to its significant production of peaches as early as 1571, with exports to other states occurring around 1858. In 2014, Georgia was third in US peach production behind California and South Carolina. South Carolina named the peach its official fruit in 1984. The peach became the state fruit of Georgia, nicknamed the \"Peach State\", in 1995. The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the boll weevil attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit.

However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint. The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act\n\nLead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure. Classification\n\nClassically, \"lead poisoning\" or \"lead intoxication\" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects. However, professionals often use \"lead poisoning\" and \"lead toxicity\" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of \"lead poisoning\" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead. The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity. Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common. Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization state that a blood lead level of 10 μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10 μg/dL. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly. Signs and symptoms\n\nLead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur. Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg/dL. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Young children are much more vulnerable to lead poisoning, as they absorb 4 to 5 times more lead than an adult from a given source. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead. On July 30, 2020, a report by UNICEF and Pure Earth revealed that lead poisoning is affecting children on a “massive and previously unknown scale.” According to the report, one in three children, up to 800 million globally, have blood lead levels at, or above, 5 micrograms per decilitre (µg/dL), the amount at which action is required. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher. Lead exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10 μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. The effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. Lead exposure in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s. Exposure routes\n\nLead is a common environmental pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, have been found to have unusually high blood lead levels. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting). Occupational exposure\n\nIn adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range workers, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Lead exposure can also occur with intense use of gun ranges, regardless of whether these ranges are indoor or out. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure. It is believed to be one of the main sources of high lead levels in the country. Paint\nSome lead compounds are colorful and are used widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children are more prone to crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching, creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternatively, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. Soil\n\nResidual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been thought that the more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more likely it is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, tire weights, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard. Water\nLead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington DC and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis (Flint, Michigan), a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source caused elevated lead levels  in domestic tap water. Like Flint MI and Washington DC, a similar situation affects the State of Wisconsin, where estimates call for replacement of up to 176,000 underground pipes made of lead known as lead service lines. The city of Madison, Wisconsin addressed the issue and replaced all of their lead service lines, but there are still others that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, a permanent fix would be to replace the pipes completely. Collected rainwater from roof runoff used as potable water may contain lead, if there are lead contaminants on the roof or in the storage tank. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines allow a maximum of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) lead in water. Lead wheel weights have been found to accumulate on roads and interstates and erode in traffic entering the water runoff through drains. Lead-containing products\nLead can be found in products such as kohl, an ancient cosmetic from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many other names; and from some toys. In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint. Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead. There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead. Ingestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 84,800 metric tons consumed in 2013, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Contamination from heavily used gun ranges is of concern to those who live near by. In a recent study conducted by the CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB). This has also appeared in the illicit narcotic supply in North America, resulting in confirmed lead poisoning. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in aviation gasoline, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children. The main body tissues that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The half-life of lead in bone has been estimated as years to decades, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40 days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Enzymes\n\nThe primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which is important in the biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons. Lead poisoning interferes with the normal development of a child's brain and nervous system; therefore children are at greater risk of lead neurotoxicity than adults are. The main tool in diagnosing and assessing the severity of lead poisoning is laboratory analysis of the blood lead level (BLL). These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal lead content that is measured over the course of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. Lead poisoning shares symptoms with other conditions and may be easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Lead-exposed workers in the U.S. are required to be removed from work when their level is greater than 50 µg/dL if they do construction and otherwise greater than 60 µg/dL. Prevention\n\nIn most cases, lead poisoning is preventable by avoiding exposure to lead. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Testing kit accuracy depends on the user testing all layers of paint and the quality of the kit; the US EPA only approves kits with an accuracy rating of at least 95%. As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Regulations exist to limit the amount of lead in paint; for example, a 1978 law in the US restricted the lead in paint for residences, furniture, and toys to 0.06% or less. In October 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the allowable lead level by a factor of ten to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, giving states five years to comply with the standards. In some places, remediation programs exist to reduce the presence of lead when it is found to be high, for example in drinking water. Removing lead from airplane fuel would also be useful. Education \nThe education of workers on lead, its danger and how its workplace exposure can be decreased, especially when initial blood lead level and urine lead level are high, could help reduce the risk of lead poisoning in the workplace. Treatment\n\nThe mainstays of treatment are removal from the source of lead and, for people who have significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s as a result of the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally. Although regulation reducing lead in products has greatly reduced exposure in the developed world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust. Risk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides). Differences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be. Children are more sensitive to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Notable cases\n\nCases of mass lead poisoning can occur. As of October 5, 2010 at least 400 children have died from the effects of lead poisoning. Prognosis\n\nReversibility\nOutcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood. Encephalopathy\nLead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. Long-term\nExposure to lead may also decrease lifespan and have health effects in the long term. Death rates from a variety of causes have been found to be higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year). Furthermore, the neurological effects of lead exposure have been shown to be exacerbated and long lasting in low income children in comparison to those of higher economic standing. An increase in lead exposure in children was linked to an increase in aggravated assault rates 22 year later. History\n\nLead poisoning was among the first known and most widely studied work regarding environmental hazards. With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978. The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. Studies have found a weak link between lead from leaded gasoline and crime rates. Other species\n\nHumans are not alone in suffering from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Farm animals such as cows and horses as well as pet animals are also susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels. Wildlife\n\nLead, one of the leading causes of toxicity in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.

Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord.

Gen. Irvin McDowell on the Confederate forces led by Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard near Washington was repulsed at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas). The Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. The First Battle of Bull Run, on July 21, 1861, was the first major land battle of the war. Until this time, the North was generally confident about its prospects for quickly crushing the rebellion with an easy, direct strike against the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. The embarrassing rout of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's army during the battle made clear the fallacy of this viewpoint. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"foot cavalry\".

They are often also considered Californios, for their adherence to Californio language and culture. In California, the federal government established such forms of education as the reservation day schools and American Indian boarding schools. Some public schools would allow Indians to attend as well. Poor ventilation and nutrition (due to limited funding), and diseases were typical problems at schools for American Indians. In practice, however, most were ranch hands with limited political rights under the control of local bosses. Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners had been common during the time of Mexican rule and these increased after the 1848 American annexation and Gold Rush in California. Such marriages combined the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. As Americans increased in number, however, they pushed out Californios from power in California. The population of Native California was reduced by 90% during the 19th century—from more than 200,000 in the early 19th century to approximately 15,000 at the end of the century, mostly due to disease.

The National Industry Recovery Act set up the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The PWA used government money to build infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, for the state. The National Recovery Act also improved working conditions and outlawed child labor.

The right side of the heart pumps blood through pulmonary circulation. The left side of the heart pumps blood through systemic circulation. This diagram shows the right and left side of the heart artificially separated. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the low-pressure pulmonary circulation. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle, which then pumps it into the main artery of the body, the aorta. From the aorta, the blood is distributed through a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the veins, entering the right atrium to complete the cycle. One key distinction between pulmonary and systemic circulation is the blood pressure within the two systems. The pressure in the pulmonary circulation is significantly lower compared to the systemic circulation. This constriction helps redirect blood flow from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions, optimizing gas exchange. The two circulatory systems differ in their purpose, blood pressure, and unique regulatory mechanisms. It begins when deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, specifically the right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery. In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. One key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. During pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae and enters the right atrium. From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. Systemic circulation begins when oxygenated blood enters the left atrium from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. As the oxygen is used up and waste products are produced, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process of circulation begins again.\n\nQuestion: how oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. In 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions. The proposal creates a minimum retirement age. At the end of the transition period, there is no longer the possibility of retirement for contribution time. The minimum retirement age will be 62 for women and 65 for men for both private and servants. The proposal provides for a minimum age of 65 for men and 62 for women, and 30% of the remaining contribution time to retire under the old rules. Today the minimum age is 60 years old minimum age for men and women with 35 years of contribution. Contrary to the claim, raising the minimum retirement age for women is disregarding the double - even triple - journey they face. As a general rule, the minimum age for women would increase from 60 to 62 years. Most Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. However, in 1986 the Japanese Diet passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60.\n\nQuestion: when did the government change the retirement age\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During her time on the force, she had a traumatic experience at the hands of a serial killer known as \"The Surgeon\", Charles Hoyt. She has matching scars in the center of her palms where Hoyt stabbed her with scalpels, keeping her pinned to the ground.

From an Italian American family, Jane is brash, sarcastic, and often prickly but also a confident and independent woman as well as a brilliant detective. She is extremely competitive, especially with her younger brother, Frankie (also a cop), who is often caught in her shadow. Jane can tackle a perp like a linebacker. From the time Jill was a child, she suffered recurring sinus infections, earache, colds and flu. Sugar, soda and sweets played a significant role in Jill’s diet along with cereal grains, rice and potatoes. Jill craved sweets, snacked constantly and ate often. Constipation, gas and bloat were common for Jill. Instead, Jill was told to use an inhaler and was given steroids. When Jill’s menstrual cycle began, she suffered amenorrhea [irregular periods] sometimes skipping several months. Jill saw improvement, but after a few months, the problem returned followed by a persistent bronchial cough low energy and weight gain. Soon thereafter, Jill’s menstrual cycle included problematic, tender, lumpy breasts [fibroid tumors] and occasionally, cysts on her ovaries. Also, she suffered from explosive anger and did NOT get along with her parents. Instead, she found comfort among those with similar problems. Jill’s behavior became a serious problem made worse by unpredictable anxiety attacks. Her mother took Jill to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her, schizophrenic and bi-polar and put her on psychotropic drugs. Now, Jill suffered the social stigma of being a mental case. At age 18, Jill became sexually active and began using birth control pills. Birth control pills caused Jill’s menstrual and hormonal issues to compound in the form of chronic bladder and vaginal infections [so-called], heavy depression, imaginary voices and intense anxiety. Jill was given more antibiotics and additional drugs for her problems. Jill married at age 20 and became pregnant soon after. Like Jill, the little girl had learning problems at school and suffered from so-called, attention deficit disorder (ADD). Jill’s diet was heavy in carbohydrates and sugar; sodas and fruit juice were staples. Both Jill and her husband drank. Jill favored wine; she had been told [wrongly!] By age 40, Jill was overweight, depressed and on occasion, suicidal. By age 48, Jill’s health was in shambles. Jill had been betrayed! Jill’s story is a classic example of defective medical models that are based on symptoms instead of cause! Had Jill’s UNDERLYING issues been correctly diagnosed, her life could have been VERY different. Jill suffered from misdiagnosis and lack of guidance. FUNGAL INFLAMMATION ruled Jill’s life! A recurring theme in Jill’s story is systemic inflammation and antibiotics. Jill’s Betrayal Is Our Betrayal, as well! The medical system betrayed Jill [and the rest of us!] Jill’s struggle with weight and acne, depression, acid reflux, brain fog [poor memory], mental confusion, allergies, hair loss, chemical sensitivities and low energy were driven by systemic take-over by molds and fungi; particularly, Candida albicans. Her betrayal is an example of sick-care at its best. Regardless, when they announce, the ability to identify and understand the contributing factors is invaluable. I trust the reader will exercise this freedom, as opposed to getting in line for more of the same, otherwise known as, sick-care. While unavoidable, they only pose a threat when they activate, hatch and reproduce. Would probiotics have solved Jill’s intestinal issues? Her gas and bloat issues, allergies, chemical sensitivities and leaky-gut problems have their origin in hyphae invasion of the mucous membrane lining of Jill’s intestinal, gut wall.

It is 1260 km long; 920 km of the river forms the border between Brazil and Bolivia. While many fish species in the river essentially are Amazonian, the fauna in the Guaporé also has a connection with the Paraguay River (part of the Río de la Plata Basin). The Guaporé and the Paraguay, while flowing in different directions, both originate in the Parecis plateau of Brazil. The Mamore is interrupted by rapids a few miles above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 300 km long has been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles). Triángulo Dionisio Foianini (Dionisio Foianini Triangle) is the name given to Bolivia's border with Brazil and Paraguay. Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá. American States (OAS) reports that between 2016 and May 2018, 4,738 Venezuelans arrived in Paraguay. Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west.

The Ohio River drains portions of eight states, including, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. The Upper Mississippi River spans around 1,250 miles from Lake Itasca in Minnesota to Cairo, Illinois. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River. From the confluence of the Ohio River and Upper Mississippi River at Cairo, the Lower flows just under 1000 miles (1600 km) to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most heavily travelled component of the Mississippi River System. The Mississippi River is the largest drainage basin in the United States. From the perspective of natural geography and hydrology, the system consists of the Mississippi River itself and its numerous natural tributaries and distributaries. The major tributaries are the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Red rivers. Given their flow volumes, major Ohio River tributaries like the Allegheny, Tennessee, and Wabash rivers are considered important tributaries to the Mississippi \n\n tributary the Yazoo.

Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says \"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes\". In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as: \"an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich \n\n and other geological changes over thousands of years can alter the landscape and seascape to the point where identification may be extremely difficult. The geography of the Apologoi (the tale that Odysseus told to the Phaeacians, forming books 9-12 of the Odyssey), and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of Scheria, pose quite different problems from those encountered in identifying Troy, Mycenae, Pylos and Ithaca. For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. Ancient sources provide a wealth of interpretations of Odysseus' wanderings, with a complex range of traditions which affect one another in various ways. The most standard identifications, which are rarely disputed in ancient sources, are:\n\n  Events in the main sequence of the Odyssey (excluding the narrative of Odysseus's adventures) take place in the Peloponnese and in what are now called the Ionian Islands (Ithaca and its neighbours). However, scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after Ismaros and before his return to Ithaca) were real. The geographer Strabo and many others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer Eratosthenes had said in the late 3rd century BC: \"You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds.\" In Odyssey 8, Odysseus lands on the island of the Phaeacians. During Odysseus' time there, the Phaeacians stage a series of athletic contests for Odysseus so that he could spread stories about the Phaeacians' athletic prowess. After declining the offer, one Phaeacian, Euryalos, joked that Odysseus did not have the skills to compete in an athletic competition.\n\nQuestion: where do the phaeacians live in the odyssey\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the gladiatorial games using an emerald as a corrective lens.

The English friar Roger Bacon's 1260s or 1270s written works on optics, partly based on the works of Arab writers, described the function of corrective lenses for vision and burning glasses. Galileo greatly improved upon these designs the following year. The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 \n\n There is disputed archeological evidence of use of lenses in antiquity, spanning several millennia.

There are three distinct ways that precipitation can occur. Precipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing level. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Their respective intensities are classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction. Atmospheric pressure &ndash; the pressure at any given point in the Earth's atmosphere ; Cloud &ndash; a visible mass of droplets or frozen crystals floating in the atmosphere above the surface of a planet ; Rain &ndash; precipitation in which separate drops of water fall to the Earth from clouds, a product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor ; Snow &ndash; precipitation in the form of crystalline water ice, consisting of a multitude of snowflakes that fall from clouds Freezing rain &ndash; precipitation that falls from a cloud as snow, melts completely on its way down, then passes through a layer of below-freezing air becoming supercooled, at which point it \n\n typically cloud particles collide and fall out of the sky as precipitation. Even though precipitation can fall in many forms and in many locations, most precipitations either ends up back into a body of water or on land as surface runoff.

The major agencies that make up the PHS include:\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): The CDC is responsible for protecting public health and safety by controlling and preventing diseases, including infectious diseases and chronic diseases. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA): HRSA aims to improve access to healthcare services, especially for underserved and vulnerable populations, by providing funding and support to healthcare providers and communities. These agencies work collectively to protect and promote health through various programs, research initiatives, policy development, and healthcare delivery. By addressing public health concerns, conducting research, and providing healthcare services, the PHS and its associated agencies contribute to the well-being of individuals and communities in the United States and worldwide. The American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) is a nonprofit organization that pursues distinction in health and human services by working with policymakers, supporting state and local agencies, and working with partners to promote innovative, integrative and efficient solutions in health and human services policy and practice. The ASPA subsection is named the Section on Health and Human Services Administration and its purpose is to foster the development of knowledge, understanding and practice in the fields of health and human services administration and to foster professional growth and communication among academics and practitioners in these fields. Fields of health and human services administration share a common and unique focus on improving the quality of life through client-centered policies and service transactions. Its purpose is to create a \n\nThe role of the Assistant Secretary for Health in the United States Public Health Service (PHS) is to oversee the PHS and provide leadership and guidance in matters related to public health. The Assistant Secretary for Health is responsible for ensuring the implementation of public health policies and programs, coordinating activities among PHS agencies, and advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The PHS is a collection of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, and it includes eight of the department's eleven operating divisions. These divisions cover various aspects of public health, such as the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and Indian Health Service, among others. The Assistant Secretary for Health plays a crucial role in coordinating the efforts of these agencies to address public health challenges, promote disease prevention and control, and improve the overall health and well-being of the American population. They work closely with other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations, to develop and implement effective public health policies and strategies. In 1995, PHS agencies were shifted to report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, rather than the Assistant Secretary for Health, which eliminated PHS as an administrative level in the organizational hierarchy. In summary, the Assistant Secretary for Health in the United States Public Health Service plays a vital role in overseeing the PHS, coordinating public health efforts, and advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters related to public health.

In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females. The tail is about 30 cm long in both sexes. The height at the shoulder is 25 to 30 cm. On average males weigh 3.5 kg, with a range of 3.2 to 9.4 kg, while females average 2.9 kg, with a range of 1.4 to 3.2 kg. Scientists have looked at whether height increases or decreases risk of cardiovascular diseases for decades. For instance, research suggests taller people suffer more from a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, as well as Marfan syndrome (a connective tissue and collagen disorder), which can come with heart valve problems and abnormalities of the aorta. Being short also seems to come with risks. A study from 2015 found that shorter people suffer coronary artery disease more often. “Growth during this period of childhood is not significantly associated with either of these stroke subtypes, suggesting that underlying mechanisms linking height with risks of stroke may exert their influence already by early childhood,” wrote the stroke study authors. The research looked at data on more than 300,000 Danish schoolchildren born over nearly six decades. Researchers noted that boys and girls who were 2 to 3 inches shorter than average when they were between ages 7 and 13 were at increased risk during their adult years of clot-related, or ischemic, stroke in both sexes and of bleeding, or hemorrhagic, stroke in men. Despite studies over many decades looking at height and health, there’s still a lot unknown about how the two intersect. What is considered “short” or “tall” varies by study with consideration to the population and gender being studied. There also is usually a midpoint height used based on the research. In the stroke study, the average height at age 7 was about 4 feet for both boys and girls. Is it height or is it an environmental factor, such as nutrition, that made the difference? In 2010, a meta-analysis of 52 studies involving more than 3 million men and women found that shorter people had a higher risk of having deadly heart disease than tall people. But Dr. Jaakko Tuomilehto of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki in Finland and author of the editorial “Tall is beautiful and heart-healthy?” published in 2010 in European Heart Journal didn’t stop there, suggesting everyone model healthy behaviors. “On the other hand, tall people are not protected against coronary heart disease, and they also need to pay attention to the same risk factors as shorter people,” he wrote. All people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. It also has genetic similarities to thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. It affects both males and females, with female patients having an average height of 4 feet and ½ inches (123 centimeters) and male patients having an average height of 4 feet and 3½ inches (131 centimeters). Primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, achondroplasia is one of the common causes of dwarfism. Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. In addition, it also shares similar presentations with other diseases like thanatophoric dysplasia as well as osteoporosis. Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature.\n\nQuestion: what is the average height of a chinese man\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is \"real is positive, virtual is negative\". Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative. Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as\n\n length f at the distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor at 2f beyond that lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second image with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula showing that with object distance ). In modern optical telescopes and telescopic sights with a dual-focal plane design, the objective image is typically already inverted upon reaching the relay lenses, and thus needed to be inverted again back \n\n  An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it \n\n For optical instruments with an eyepiece, the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece (virtual image in infinite distance) cannot be given, thus size means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point (angular size). For example, the mean angular size of the Moon's disk as viewed from Earth's surface is about 0.52°. By convention, for magnifying glasses and optical microscopes, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: 25 cm from the eye. In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water.\n\nQuestion: a concave mirror can form a real image which is a copy of an object that forms\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center.

In 1953, they proposed a model in which DNA forms a double helix, consisting of two strands that are twisted around each other. By unraveling the structural foundation of DNA, Watson and Crick laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology. Overall, the collaboration between Watson and Crick, coupled with insights from other scientists, led to the unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and paving the way for numerous scientific advancements. more concentrated effort to deduce the structure of DNA. Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal Nature in April 1953. Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA. Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nQuestion: who proposed the first accurate model of dna\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness. Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on translational research. SEER began collecting data on cancer cases on January 1, 1973, in the states of Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, and the metropolitan areas of Detroit and San Francisco-Oakland. The NCI Formulary is a public-private partnership between NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is also one of NCI’s efforts in support of the Cancer Moonshot, answering Vice President Biden’s call for greater collaboration and faster development of new therapies for patients. “The NCI Formulary will help researchers begin testing promising drug combinations more quickly, potentially helping patients much sooner,” said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. The NCI Formulary leverages lessons learned through NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the NCI-MATCH trial, a study in which targeted agents from different companies are being tested alone or in combination in patients with genetic mutations that are targeted by these drugs. “We are very pleased that several additional pharmaceutical companies have already pledged a willingness to participate and are in various stages of negotiation with NCI,” said Dr. Doroshow, who is also director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. “By the end of 2017, we expect to have doubled the number of partnerships and drugs available in the NCI Formulary.” CTEP staff continue to discuss the NCI Formulary with pharmaceutical companies to make additional proprietary agents available for studies initiated by investigators at NCI-designated Cancer Centers. About the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH’s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers. For more information about cancer, please visit the NCI website at cancer.gov or call NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases. For more information about NIH and its programs, visit nih.gov. Since 1997, when the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance was founded, survival rates from ovarian cancer have not significantly improved. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance has worked to ensure that necessary treatments are covered by Medicare; that drugs and tests on the market are safe and effective; and that federal policy makers are aware of the importance of the ovarian cancer community. The primary responsibility of the NCI is to coordinate the National Cancer Program. These programs focus on conducting cutting-edge research in various areas related to cancer biology, treatment modalities, prevention strategies, and supportive care. Additionally, the NCI provides funding to support cancer researchers throughout the United States.\n\nQuestion: when did congress passes legislation to fund the national cancer institute\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

National minimum wage law began with Winston Churchill's Trade Boards Act 1909, and the Wages Councils Act 1945 set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy. Wages Councils were abolished in 1993 and subsequently replaced with a single statutory national minimum wage by the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which is still in force. From 1 April 2016 the minimum wage has been paid as a mandatory National Living Wage for workers over 25. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers.\n\nQuestion: what is the minimum wage in france per hour\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When news of this reached London in March 1782, the government of Lord North fell and Great Britain immediately sued for peace terms; however, France delayed the end of the war until September 1783 in \n\nComte de Rochambeau – A French aristocrat, soldier, and a Marshal of France who participated in the American Revolutionary War. ; General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname leading 1,350 Continental Army troops in a surprise attack against the 544 man British garrison at Stony Point. Washington and his unanimous cabinet (including Jefferson) decided the treaty did not bind the U.S. to enter the war, since they stopped being in favor of the Revolution after they executed the King; instead Washington proclaimed neutrality. Nevertheless, he did seize the opportunity to purchase Louisiana in 1803. The broad similarities but different experiences between the French and American revolutions lead to a certain kinship between France and the United States, with both countries seeing themselves as pioneers of liberty and promoting republican ideals. Franklin's wish to keep Lafayette safe was frustrated by the young man's desire to be where battles raged, and he was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777. France soon entered the war on the American side, and was instrumental in the victory. Lafayette helped lead the decisive Yorktown campaign, leading to the surrender of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis alongside his entire army, which sealed the fate of the war in favor of the Americans.

In August, the combined American and French armies headed south, marching through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, a route that allowed them to evade British troops.

Analysis showed they were infected with the same strain—a H1N1 type containing genes of human, bird and swine origin. A 2004 study found that in Iowa, 20 percent of swine veterinarians and 3percent of meatpackers, but no university workers, had antibodies in their blood indicating they had been infected with swine flu. Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies. Pigs \n\n fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission causes human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Signs and symptoms\n\nIn pigs, a swine influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. Although mortality is usually low (around 1–4%), the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Pigs have often been seen as \"mixing vessels\", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans. Humans\n\nDirect transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (zoonotic swine flu). Virology\n\nTransmission\n\nBetween pigs\nInfluenza is quite common in pigs, with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US. Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries. Intensive farming may also increase the risk of transmission, as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other. The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses, or through dried mucus. Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection. The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd, infecting all the pigs within just a few days. Transmission may also occur through wild animals, such as wild boar, which can spread the disease between farms. To humans\nPeople who work with poultry and swine, especially those with intense exposures, are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers. Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs\nPigs are unusual as they can be infected with influenza strains that usually infect three different species: pigs, birds, and humans. Pigs are a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes, producing new and dangerous strains. Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. These H5N1 infections may be quite common; in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java, where avian flu had broken out, five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative. It is an enveloped virus; the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Classification\nOf the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu, two also cause influenza in pigs, with influenza A being common in pigs and influenza C being rare. Influenza B has not been reported in pigs. Within influenza A and influenza C, the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct, although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine, avian, and human species boundaries. Influenza C\nInfluenza  viruses infect both humans and pigs, but do not infect birds. Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past. For example, influenza C caused small outbreaks of a mild form of influenza amongst children in Japan and California. Because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza C, this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans. In the United States, the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998; however, since late August 1998, H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs. Prevention\nPrevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention in pigs, prevention of transmission to humans, and prevention of its spread among humans. Proper handwashing techniques can prevent the virus from spreading. Swine\nMethods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination (ATCvet code: ). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient. Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus. Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be quarantined. After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur. Humans\nPrevention of pig-to-human transmission\n Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the antigenic shifts can occur that create new influenza strains. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, it may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Prevention of human-to-human transmission\nInfluenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze, then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face. Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products, since the virus is not transmitted through food. These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans  This could be due to several factors. Treatment\n\nSwine\nAs swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required. Instead, veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm or to other farms. Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to treat the disease, which, although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections in influenza-weakened herds. In Europe the avian-like H1N1 and the human-like H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine, of which avian-like H1N1 is the most frequent. Since 2009 another subtype, pdmH1N1(2009), emerged globally and also in European pig population. The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds. Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies. Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N1(2009). Humans\nIf a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930. For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. These strains, which include genes derived by reassortment from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm. However, direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005. Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about £65 million every year. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others, including swine, suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. Six of the genes are very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000. The strain, a variant of H1N1, is known as A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1). This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. The vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems. \"The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu—now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations.\" There were reports of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a paralyzing neuromuscular disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. Although whether a link exists is still not clear, this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines. The only pathogen identified was an H1N1 strain of swine influenza virus. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was reportedly widespread among the pigs exhibited at the fair. The virus was able to spread between people, since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild, influenza-like illnesses, and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu, but there was no community outbreak. Within a year, it had spread through pig populations across the United States. Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans. The mortality rate is less than 10% for swine flu, unless there are complications like hog cholera. Cases were also detected in the districts of Kathmandu, Morang, Kaski, and Chitwan. The virus is a variant genotype 4 (G4) Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus that mainly affects pigs, but there is some evidence of it infecting people. A peer-reviewed paper from the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) stated that \"G4 EA H1N1 viruses possess all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans ... Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring of swine working populations should be promptly implemented.\" The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs rebutted the study, saying that the media had interpreted the study \"in an exaggerated and nonfactual way\" and that the number of pigs sampled was too small to demonstrate G4 had become the dominant strain. Between 2016 and 2018, a serum surveillance program screened 338 swine production workers in China for exposure (presence of antibodies) to G4 EA H1N1 and found 35 (10.4%) positive. Among another 230 people screened who did not work in the swine industry, 10 (4.4%) were serum positive for antibodies indicating exposure. Health officials (including Anthony Fauci) say the virus should be monitored, particularly among those in close contact with pigs, but it is not an immediate threat. There are no reported cases or evidence of the virus outside of China as of July 2020. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus infected pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became known as swine flu. Genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of four influenza viruses forming a novel strain:\nNorth American Swine (30.6%) – pig origin\nNorth American Avian (34.4%) – bird origin\nHuman influenza strain (17.5%)\nEuroasian swine (17.5%) – Pig origin\nQuadruple genetic re-assortment  – coinfection with influenza viruses from diverse animal species. Due to coinfection, the viruses are able to interact, mutate, and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity. New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain. Humans have been affected since early 2009. The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, \"opening a new chapter in the global epidemic\". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They \n\nA H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs. Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype. What are the symptoms in humans? Humans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze and then touching their mouth or nose before washing their hands.) Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Although the current swine flu does not have a high mortality rate, it is known to be highly contagious. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. The concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze) and then touching their mouths or nose before washing their hands.

The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms. In an ionisation type smoke detector, ambient air is allowed to freely enter the ionization chamber. If smoke enters the detector, it disrupts this current because ions strike smoke particles and are neutralized. This drop in current triggers the alarm. Americium-241, an alpha emitter, is used in smoke detectors. Smoke particles from the fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm. Fire alarms– Fire alarms monitors the environmental changes associated with combustion. Once the alarm has been triggered by fire or smoke, a loud sound emanates to warn of danger and sends a message to a central monitoring center, which then notifies the local fire department. If smoke gets between the plates where ionization is taking place, the ionized gas can be neutralized leading to a reduced current.

It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature. Romanticism has been seen as \"the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages\", reaching beyond rational and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. The name \"Romanticism\" itself was derived from the medieval genre chivalric romance. the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. Romantic medicine is part of the broader movement known as Romanticism, most predominant in the period 1800–1840, and involved both the cultural (humanities) and natural sciences, not to mention efforts to better understand man within a spiritual context ('spiritual science'). In Germany, the Sturm und Drang period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the century. In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the Belle Époque, with its Fin de siècle retrospectively appeared as a \"golden age\" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nQuestion: when did the romanticism period start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The 2015 Chinese stock market crash was also a bear market. On March 16, 2020, after it became clear that a recession was inevitable, the DJIA dropped 12.93%, or 2,997 points, the largest point drop since Black Monday (1987), surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.32%, and the S&P 500 Index dropped 11.98%. By the end of May 2020, the stock market indices briefly recovered to their levels at the end of February 2020. A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles. There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\nQuestion: when was the last time stock market crashed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story \"The Bubble Bursts.\" In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical shtetl in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to \"scratch out a pleasant, simple tune\" without breaking their necks. The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven. \"Tradition\" is the opening number for the 1964 Broadway musical Fiddler on the Roof. In the song, the main character, Tevye, explains the roles of each social class (fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters) in the village of Anatevka, and how the traditional roles of people like the matchmaker, the beggar, and the rabbi contribute to the village. The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. Overall, the song sets up the major theme of the villagers trying to continue their traditions and keep their society running as the world around them changes.\n\nQuestion: who sings far from the home i love in fiddler on the roof\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the pilot episode of Friends, Ross says \"Do the words 'Billy, don’t be a hero' mean anything to you?”, meaning 'easier said than done'. The Doug Anthony Allstars performed a comedic cover of this song, featuring the altered line, \"Where did Billy's head go?\" Dav Pilkey, creator of Captain Underpants, named the hero of The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby Billy solely to make possible a passing homage to \"Billy Don't Be a Hero.\" Hope and Glory is a 1987 comedy-drama-war film, written, produced and directed by John Boorman and based on his own experiences of growing up in London during the Second World War. The film tells the story of the Rowan family and their experiences of as seen through the eyes of the son, Billy (Sebastian Rice-Edwards). Hope and Glory was a critical and commercial success; it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. Before the 1760s, Britain's American colonies had enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were locally governed by colonial legislatures. The passage of the Stamp Act \n\n adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. Shortly after a Bill of Rights was ratified as the first ten amendments, guaranteeing fundamental rights used as justification for the revolution. The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. Rhode Island was the final state to ratify the Constitution in 1790, the first ten amendments were ratified in 1791 and became known as the United States Bill of Rights.\n\nQuestion: when did the tradition of self government began in america\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In one scene, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II create a new song, \"There's Music in You\", then perform it for their friends, with Rodgers at the piano and Hammerstein singing the vocals. Mary Martin is later seen rehearsing the song for director Joshua Logan. The black-and-white film, which has a running time of 97 minutes, was directed by Tay Garnett, screenplay by Samson Raphaelson, based on a story Robert E. Sherwood, and photographed by James Wong Howe. On the Town is a musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, based on Jerome Robbins' idea for his 1944 ballet Fancy Free, which he had set to Bernstein's music. The musical introduced several popular and classic songs, among them \"New York, New York\", \"Lonely Town\", \"I Can Cook, Too\" (for which Bernstein also wrote the lyrics), and \"Some Other Time\". Each of the three sailors meets and quickly connects with a woman. The musical integrates dance into its storytelling: Robbins made several ballets and extended dance sequences for the show, including the \"Imaginary Coney Island\" ballet. In 1959 the British composer Peter Dickinson used part of the music in his Monologue for string orchestra, principally the melodic line under the lyric \"People will say we're in...\".\n\nQuestion: who wrote somewhere there 's a place for us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The first theologo-philosophical justification for worshiping Radha-Krishna was given by Nimbarkacharya, a founder of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in 12th or 13th century. He appears in a number of Hindu texts, notably the Mahabharata, telling Yudhishtira the story of Prahlada and the Ramayana as well as in the Puranas. He is also referred to as Rishiraj, meaning the king of all sages or rishis. Balasubramaniam is derived from the Sanskrit words balu meaning \"young\" and Subramaniam (itself derived from the Sanskrit words su, meaning \"auspicious\" and brahmanyam, translated loosely as \"auspicious effulgence of the Supreme Spirit\").

Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth. Anterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment. Diastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth). Diastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. The gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics. It is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws. Periodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation. The frenum is an extension of our gum in between specific teeth like central incisors, anteriorly and the molars, posteriorly. Gum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema. Periodontitis, on the other hand, affects structures surrounding the teeth, majorly underlying bone structure. Because of compromised bone structure and periodontal ligaments, mobility appears in teeth, hence the drifting and diastema. In cases of high frenal attachments, frenectomy can be done. This is a simple procedure that relieves the pressure on the teeth and drifting stops. In all of the cases mentioned above, after treating the underlying causes, fixed orthodontic therapy should be done followed by retention appliances. So, if you have a void in your dental arch, then visit your dentist as soon as possible. If you want to maintain a good esthetics, then the gap between teeth shouldn’t be ignored as our jaws expand over time. Over the period, the size of the diastema might enlarge and cause functional problems. Gaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. In some cases, the labial frenum extends down and between the two front teeth, creating a gap. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth. Traditional Orthodontics: Traditional orthodontics is highly effective at closing gaps between teeth. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy. A diastema (plural diastemata, from greek διάστημα, space) is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth. One common cause is size mismatch, where the size of the teeth is smaller compared to the size of the jaw bone. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Sporting Times printed a mocking obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a \"milk-white\" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called \"play\" and the \"leathern orb\" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, \n\n umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches.

Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Here is a list of the current attractions found therein, arranged by \"land\" and with brief descriptions. (The term \"attractions\" is used by Disney as a catch-all term for rides, shows, and exhibits.) Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning 56.656 ha—the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. The resort is fully owned and operated by The Oriental Land Company under a license from The Walt Disney Company, who constructed and designed the resort and its various attractions. The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park (Tokyo Disneyland), but later developed into a resort with a second theme park (Tokyo DisneySea), four Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels and a shopping complex (Ikspiari). Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park to open outside the United States and the resort is the only Disney Parks resort in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity. Plans for a second Disney park in Tokyo were first conceived in 1987. Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point.\n\nQuestion: who was the first to say i 'm going to disney world\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is known for his pace, dribbling and ability to convert from counter chances. He has won 26 major honours, including five La Liga titles and three UEFA Champions League titles. Pedro represented Spain in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships, winning the former in 2010 and the latter in 2012. By doing so, the Catalans became the first European team to twice win the domestic double as well as the highest continental tournament, after winning their first treble in the 2008–09 season. Barcelona's success was due to a large extent to their formidable forward trio composed of Lionel Messi, Neymar and summer signing Luis Suárez, who scored an unprecedented total of 122 goals in all competitions to become the trio with most goals in Spanish football history. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice. Pedro, Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Gerard Piqué, Sergio Busquets and Dani Alves are the only players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams.

Ever since Agnes got The Saints' Way (The Saints' Way is a book that everyone in Mount Blessing gets when they turn twelve; it is given by the leader Emmanuel), she has changed.

Whenever they, or anyone, do something wrong they are sent to the \"regulation room\". There they get whipped by Emmanuel and Veronica. Everything stays this way until Nana Pete, Agnes' grandmother, shows up unexpectedly and finds out the truth behind Mount Blessing.

(Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \n\n technical developments to the forefront of fiction: R.U.R – Rossum’s Universal Robots, Karel Čapek’s play of sentient robots endowed with emotions used as slave labor is not only credited with the invention of the term ‘robot’ (derived from the Czech word for forced labor, robota) but was also an international success after it premiered in 1921. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the earliest use (as \"Androides\") to Ephraim Chambers' 1728 Cyclopaedia, in reference to an automaton that St. Albertus Magnus allegedly created. The term \"android\" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons. The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI. Although Karel Čapek's robots in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1921)—the play that introduced the word robot to the world—were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.\n\nQuestion: where did the term ' robot ' come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
