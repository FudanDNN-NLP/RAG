["The best way to guess a baby's eye color is by looking at the genealogy records of their family. This is because eye color is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the genes that determine eye color are passed down from generation to generation. By examining the eye colors of the baby's parents, grandparents, and other close relatives, it's possible to make an educated guess about what the baby's eye color might be. While the surroundings and diet of the baby may have some impact on eye color, these factors are generally not significant enough to significantly alter the baby's eye color. Ultimately, the best way to determine a baby's eye color is to wait and see.", 'What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?\nA.

  Table 2 is simplified example from Mendelian genetics involving controlled breeding of flowers. It demonstrates the outcome when flowers of different colors are crossed with each other. The dominant color gene (Red) decides the outcome when crossed with recessive color gene (yellow) producing a hybrid (Red*) flower. If either parent possesses the dominant gene, the table shows the outcome that results.

  The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent

  The simplest and easiest way to detect trisomy 8 is by a Karyotype, a photograph representing all chromosomes of a cell in an orderly manner. Amniocentesis is also a technique for diagnosis. Samples from the Amniotic Liquid is taken from a fetus, cultured, then analyzed by a karyotype. If the photograph shows 3 copies of chromosome 8 instead of 2, then the individual has trisomy 8.

  trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis... people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black." Neitz said: "Our visual system is supposed to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance... but I've studied individual differences in colour vision for 30 years, and this is one of the biggest individual differences I've ever seen." Similar theories have been expounded by the University of Liverpool's Paul Knox, who stated that

In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as "chimeras", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.

  "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials. The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

 Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid).Acquired nystagmus can also occur with _Graves' disease_ , an overactive thyroid (see **Protruding Eyes** , above), as well as several inner ear disorders. And it can be a very early warning sign of a number of neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, a brain tumor, or even a stroke. A blow to the head can sometimes cause nystagmus, in which case it may be a warning sign of a brain injury. **STOP SIGN**

  Children should be tested for color blindness as early as possible. Since many toys and preschool activities are color dependent, teachers should be alerted if a child is color-blind. Otherwise they may mistakenly think that the child has a language or other problem. Early detection is also important for safety. A child who is color-blind may not be able to tell the difference between red and green traffic lights. ### **CROSSED EYES**

**_Q:_** _I've heard that babies with crossed eyes often grow out of it. Is that true?_

**_A:_** That may be true depending on how young—or old—a baby is when the crossed eyes are first sighted. Eye movement disorders, medically referred to as _strabismus_ , are very common in newborns. The majority of these babies have crossed eyes—that is, one eye that turns slightly inward. This condition is medically known as _esotropia_. When it occurs in infancy, babies usually outgrow it by 3 months. **SIGNIFICANT FACT**

  There's a condition called _pseudostrabismus_ , in which a baby's eyes look crossed but aren't. It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid). Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.When an older baby develops crossed eyes, usually between 2 and 4 months of age, it's referred to as _infantile_ or _congenital esotropia_.Babies do _not_ outgrow this form of esotropia, which may be inherited.Eye-muscle surgery is often recommended, but even then, the condition may recur later in childhood or adulthood, requiring further surgery.

  Babies' eyes—especially light-colored eyes—are very sun-sensitive.In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2).Albinism is a rare genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce an adequate amount of melanin, the substance responsible for eye, skin, and hair color.Today, many Greeks—as well as other southern Europeans and Middle Easterners—still carry these blue amulets. However, if a baby has different-colored eyes as well as a streak of white hair or a white forelock, it can signal _Waardenburg syndrome_ (see Chapter 2), a rare, potentially serious, genetic condition. Children with this disorder often suffer from vision problems and deafness. Although there's no cure, vision and hearing problems can usually be treated, allowing the children to lead normal lives. Heterochromia can be a sign of several other congenital, but not inherited, conditions, including _Duane syndrome_ , an eye-movement disorder that sometimes also affects a child's vision (See **An Up-Cast Eye** , below) and congenital _Horner's syndrome_ , a nerve disorder. Other common signs of Horner's include two different-sized pupils and a droopy eyelid. (See **Mismatched Pupils** and **Droopy Eyes** , below.) Facial sweating on the affected side is sometimes absent. **SIGN OF THE TIMES**

  Aristotle, Alexander the Great, and Louis Pasteur were reported to have two different-colored eyes. Some modern-day celebrities—Including Kate Bosworth, Jane Seymour, Kiefer Sutherland, and Christopher Walken—do as well. ### **PALE OR PINK EYES**

**_Q:_** _My 2-month-old niece, who has very pale blue eyes, was diagnosed with albinism. Don't albinos have pink eyes? If she is an albino, will her vision be affected?_

**_A:_** While most people with albinism do have pink eyes, some have very light blue or gray eyes. Albinism is a rare genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce an adequate amount of melanin, the substance responsible for eye, skin, and hair color. In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2). **STOP SIGN**

More recently, scientists have found that in certain ethnic groups, most notably the Hopi Indians in the United States, the incidence of albinism and deafness is exceedingly high, affecting 1 in 200 people. Most children with albinism do suffer from eye problems such as poor vision, light sensitivity, crossed eyes, and _nystagmus_ , which is rapid, uncontrollable back-and-forth or up-and-down eye movements (see **Unusual Eye Movements and Positions** , below). In some cases, albinism is also associated with deafness. With the exception of these eye problems, most albinos are healthy. They do, however, have to be very careful in the sun because they're at increased risk for serious sunburn and, as a result, skin cancer.

  Babies' eyes—especially light-colored eyes—are very sun-sensitive.In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2).Albinism is a rare genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce an adequate amount of melanin, the substance responsible for eye, skin, and hair color.Today, many Greeks—as well as other southern Europeans and Middle Easterners—still carry these blue amulets. However, if a baby has different-colored eyes as well as a streak of white hair or a white forelock, it can signal _Waardenburg syndrome_ (see Chapter 2), a rare, potentially serious, genetic condition. Heterochromia can be a sign of several other congenital, but not inherited, conditions, including _Duane syndrome_ , an eye-movement disorder that sometimes also affects a child's vision (See **An Up-Cast Eye** , below) and congenital _Horner's syndrome_ , a nerve disorder. (See **Mismatched Pupils** and **Droopy Eyes** , below.) ### **PALE OR PINK EYES**

**_Q:_** _My 2-month-old niece, who has very pale blue eyes, was diagnosed with albinism. Don't albinos have pink eyes? If she is an albino, will her vision be affected?_

**_A:_** While most people with albinism do have pink eyes, some have very light blue or gray eyes. In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2). **STOP SIGN**

  Babies' eyes—especially light-colored eyes—are very sun-sensitive. Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid).Acquired nystagmus can also occur with _Graves' disease_ , an overactive thyroid (see **Protruding Eyes** , above), as well as several inner ear disorders. Since many toys and preschool activities are color dependent, teachers should be alerted if a child is color-blind. Is that true?_

**_A:_** That may be true depending on how young—or old—a baby is when the crossed eyes are first sighted. It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid). Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.When an older baby develops crossed eyes, usually between 2 and 4 months of age, it's referred to as _infantile_ or _congenital esotropia_.Babies do _not_ outgrow this form of esotropia, which may be inherited.Eye-muscle surgery is often recommended, but even then, the condition may recur later in childhood or adulthood, requiring further surgery. The simplest and easiest way to detect trisomy 8 is by a Karyotype, a photograph representing all chromosomes of a cell in an orderly manner. In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as "chimeras", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test. In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2). **STOP SIGN**

   Spherical Earth or Earth's curvature refers to the approximation of figure of the Earth as a sphere. The earliest documented mention of the concept dates from around the 5th century BC, when it appears in the writings of Greek philosophers. In the 3rd century BC, Hellenistic astronomy established the roughly spherical shape of Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth's circumference. This knowledge was gradually adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. A practical demonstration of Earth's sphericity was achieved by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano's circumnavigation (1519–1522). The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a flat Earth: In early Mesopotamian mythology, the world was portrayed as a flat

  The laws of gravity, chemistry, and physics that explain the formation and rounding of Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks. From these laws, the amount of mass Earth contains is known, as is the fact that a non-spherical planet the size of Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity. A disk the size of Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape. On a disk strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disk, contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would cause major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk). Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth conjecturists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards. Such a conjecture would also leave open for explanation the tides seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

  Climate change is defined as the long term change in weather patterns allowing for Earth's climate to change. Evidence for the Earth's cycle between hothouse and icehouse climates can be found using sedimentation and greenhouse gas data. Global Warming is the scientific theory that humans are raising the Earth's temperature primarily through increasingly burning fossil fuels causing the Earth to trap greenhouse gases which raises the Earth's temperature. Both climate change and global warming would further cause ocean: temperature levels, acidity and greenhouse gas levels to rise. In turn, this would cause many of the existing flora and fauna to perish or migrate elsewhere. For example, scientists predict that global warming will decrease the abundance of phytoplankton (a keystone

   The simplest model for the shape of the entire Earth is a sphere. The Earth's radius is the distance from Earth's center to its surface, about 6371 km. While "radius" normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the Earth deviates from spherical by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term "the radius of the Earth". The concept of a spherical Earth dates back to around the 6th century BC, but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century BC. The first scientific estimation of the radius of the Earth was given

  Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around Earth in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier. (See Circumnavigation, Arctic exploration, and History of Antarctica.) Some flat Earth conjectures that propose that Earth is a north-pole-centered disk, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges. This disk model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disk in a circle. (East-west paths form a circle in both disk and spherical geometry.) It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it would

  Climate change, which is a phenomenon also known as the greenhouse effect, is the warming that occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping. The North American Arctic is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change compared to other regions. Climate change has caused the temperature in the region to rise, extreme weather events, changing wildlife populations and habitats, and sea ice to melt resulting in rising sea levels. In November 2016, the daily average temperature was 2.22 °C (36 °F) lower than usual and sea ice cover was less than the previous recorded low in November 2012. Ice sheets have been observed to form later, separate earlier, and rapidly decline in age, thickness distribution and regional

 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force.
For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death.
Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world.
"We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S.
Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection.
Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention."
The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years.
Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England.
Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly.
"Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis .
The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone."
"For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah."
Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
"A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash."
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two.

While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera.
The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence.
The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996.
"There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive.
"For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen."
These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root.
Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.
Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path.
If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth.
Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds.
"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light.
"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now.
In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water.
The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space.
The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now.
All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago?
To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years.
In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in this region is indicative that this area may have once been an ocean. The agency’s findings using subsurface radar are not surprising but they have added to the existing data gathered from images, atmospheric measurements and mineralogical study of the planet which already previously pinpointed the northern plains to be the site of ancient Martian shorelines.
2012 STUDY ON MARTIAN METEORITES BY MCCUBBIN ET AL.
Within that same year, planetary scientist Francis McCubbin of the University Of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues published a study on Martian meteorites containing hydrated minerals which allowed them to estimate how much water exists today in the Martian mantle. The authors of the study determined that Mars has enough water in its mantle to submerge the planet for as deep as 200 to 1000 meters. This means the planet is currently shrouding around 70 to 300 parts per million of liquid water somewhere beneath its surface.
Then there’s also the study published by the international journal Icarus in 2014 which revealed that a team of geologists found evidence of a vast ancient underground ocean located beneath the surface of Aram Chaos, one of the impact craters on Mars. Around 2.5 billion years ago, about 93,000 cubic kilometers of water supposedly broke through and flooded the surface after the lake ice – which was concealed underground – melted and its ceiling suddenly collapsed.
Here’s an idea how much water reached the Martian surface at the time: they say it is equivalent to around 80% of the free-flowing fresh water that exists on our own planet today.
In 2015, researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, led by planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva, developed infrared maps of water isotopes on Mars which showed the distribution of atmospheric water on the planet - H2O and its deuterated form, HDO. In doing so, they were able to estimate how much liquid water Mars used to have. According to their findings, Mars may have once had enough water to cover up to 20 percent or about a fifth of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. They also suggested that the planet could still contain some subterranean water reservoirs and that the key to finding them lies in refining the infrared maps they had developed.
That same year, another study revealed that NASA’s Curiosity rover – which landed on Mars’s Gale Crater back in 2012 – managed to measure estimates of the concentration of subterranean water on the planet. The new measurements suggested that the soil in Mars is moist with liquid brine. The presence of this liquid brine is supposedly caused by the perchlorate salts found in the soil as it is known to reduce the freezing point of water. The salt is the one responsible for absorbing the water vapor from the atmosphere which then precipitated under the surface. The researchers considered this find as an indirect evidence of transient liquid water on the planet though they insist that the presence of liquid brine is not enough to deem Mars equipped to support terrestrial organisms.
A similar finding was reached that same year by examining the data and images gathered from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO. At the time, the researchers believed that the dark streaks found on Martian craters is actually Martian soil being dampened by briny water, which may have been enough to allow microbial life to thrive on the planet. However, authors of a later study argued against the hypothesis that there is liquid water on the Martina surface, suggesting instead that the dark streaks captured by the MRO’s powerful camera were just grains of sand and dust that occasionally slipped downhill.
An underground layer of water ice was also detected within the planet’s Utopia Planitia region. Researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter again, particularly its ground-penetrating Shallow Radar instrument, which is also referred to as SHARAD. After they analyzed the data provided by the high-powered radar, they discovered a massive deposit of water ice in the area that is much bigger than the State of Mexico. This subterranean ice deposit runs deep – between an estimated thickness of 260 feet to around 560 feet. Fifty to eight-five percent of the deposit is made of ice while the rest is made up of dust and rock particles.
The water ice deposit in Utopia Planitia managed to elude the danger of being vaporized by the planet’s hostile atmosphere because of the thick soil that successfully separated the two. Estimates of the soil’s thickness in this region range between 3 to 33 feet.
Another compelling evidence that supports the theory that an ancient underground ocean is hidden beneath the Red Planet’s surface comes from the reanalyzed data from NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft which has been orbiting the planet since 2001. Researchers found patches of water ice in regions at surprisingly lower latitudes. Should this equatorial ice eventually melt and reach the surface, it is presumed that it would very likely result to the formation of a more accommodating environment that could be perfect for the survival and growth of microbial life.
Despite the vast amount of research that has gone into finding water and life on Mars, many of the missing pieces needed to complete the entire picture of what happened to this unique Red Planet and what remains there now have yet to be found. However, it is safe to say that we know more about our neighbor planet now more than we did before, and most of the information we have learned about Mars has only strengthened our scientific community’s conviction that liquid water once filled a sizeable portion of the planet’s surface and may still be lurking beneath its porous subterranean rocks.
Since the first Apollo mission in 1969, astronauts have since reported strange flashes of light on the surface of the moon that seems to come out of nowhere.
Many scientists have made speculations about the cause and possible origins of the flashing lights but none of them have ever come close to being a definitive explanation.
However, there are some theories that may hold a little weight in explaining the occurrence of these strange flashes. So, in today’s video we are exploring some of the theories as we try to figure out these mysterious flashes of light on the surface of the moon.
As mentioned earlier, astronauts since the first moon landing by Apollo 11 have reported sighting s of flashing lights on the moon’s surface. What’s strange about it is that they have reported these flashes even when their eyes are closed.
In one documentary, the lights were allegedly seen by several of the Apollo astronauts as they approached the moon.
Astronauts who have encountered the lights would describe it as white flashes but there are others that have reported back after encountering lights in different colours such as blue and yellow; and in almost all instances, after they have come back home to earth, astronauts who have come across these lights would still see these flashes under various lighting conditions.
A theory explains why these astronauts are seeing what they were seeing and it all points towards cosmic rays.
Defined as a “highly energetic atomic nucleus or particle that travels through space at a speed close to that of light”, these rays – and how they interacted with the human optic nerve – are responsible for the eyes seeing strange lights in varying degrees of colours depending on how much radiation from cosmic rays the optic nerve has absorbed.
To test this theory, engineers put together an experiment involving a black box that can be worn as a helmet. The box would then have sensors that would detect the presence of cosmic rays.
Astronaut Charles Duke wore the helmet on his next mission and reported back seeing clusters of lights and white streaks the same time the box detected the presence of cosmic rays in his immediate environment.
Another theory explaining the flashes of lights is the existence of cold spots on the moon’s surface. These cold spots have been discovered to have layers of thin ice and frost that, when lights from the sun reflects on it, creates flashing or blinking that may trick the eye into believing that the lights are coming from the moon itself.
Revealed from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO, the data brought back helped researches identify certain areas on the moon’s south pole that are cold enough to have frost formations. These formations are suspected to be located in craters where temperatures can drop to negative 163 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore, the research suggests that the icy deposits on the moon appear to be thin and in patches and may be mixed in with the moon’s soil and dust. Also, the evidence of frost suggests that the moon may either have water deposits for millions of years or may have been brought by colliding asteroids which may also explain how water was delivered on the surface of the earth.
Although, another hypothesis points out that hydrogen may have been present in a different form on the surface of the moon – but the idea that the moon could store water ice is still difficult to confirm and is being looked into for over 50 years now and since 2009 understanding the main composition of these icy deposits are still being studied and remains one of the main goals of the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter.
This is a controversial area of study that mainly involves looking into bright sparks on the moon’s surface, discolourations, or misty patches of lunar fog.
Transient Lunar Phenomenon was a term created by Sir Patrick Moore in 1968 in order to give the sightings credence in the scientific community. However, these sightings have existed for more than a millennium according to studies on the subject.
One of the early records of this phenomenon was traced back to a mistake made in the 16th Century when early astronomers spotted a “daytime star” near the moon but was later on discovered to be the planet Venus.
Fast forward to 1969 to a time when astronomy has made larger strides since the 16th Century; during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong remarked that there was “an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area” of the moon.
After several studies conducted by NASA after the Apollo 11 mission, various photographs and images have been taken and produced in order to find the root cause of the strange lights.
Unfortunately, unlike the sudden flashes caused by asteroids on impact, the illumination on the surface of the moon appears to be much more subtle and harder to trace.
In a study conducted by the British Astronomical Association led by Jill Scrambler, the amount of data used between 1700 and 2010 were impressive and the studies conducted on each of them were extremely thorough as each data from different observers – from amateur to seasoned astronomers – were weighed for reliability.
The result was that at least 2% of the TLP sightings were considered “definitive” and unambiguous”. To put it simply: there really is something happening on the surface of the moon, we just aren’t sure what it is. To this very day, researchers are not clear as to what the real cause of TLPs is.
Fortunately for scientists and astronomers continuing to conduct their research on the phenomenon, a new spacecraft called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer was launched in the summer of 2013 to better explore the surface of the moon and provide clearer explanations about these mysterious illuminations and flashing lights.
SYDNEY (AP) — One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I.
No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week.
While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.
"It was the first loss for the RAN and the first Allied submarine loss in World War I — a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies," Payne said in a statement.
The AE1 made final contact with an Australian ship at 2:30 p.m. the day it disappeared. Mystified villagers on a nearby island at the time spoke of seeing a "monster" or "devil fish" that appeared and quickly disappeared into the water.
For years, the United States government has always tried to maintain a safe and somewhat skeptical position when it concerns the possibility of alien life and likelihood that extraterrestrial beings may try to visit our planet or have already succeeded in doing so. Whenever footage or information on unexpected sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs are released and made known to the public, government institutions are quick to refute the possibility that the origins of these aerial objects are not of this world. Instead, they offer explanations that they deem more plausible, completely veering the public’s attention and curiosity from topics they feel are best left undiscussed. Perhaps this is to prevent the public from descending into chaos because of their misguided fears. Or, perhaps it is to spare the rest of us from having to deal with difficult truths while those in the government covertly act with our best interests supposedly always in mind.
Usually, it’s the former. Most of the time, our excessively creative imaginations and our tendency to get ahead of ourselves are our own worst enemies. Rarely do we get to learn some of the things our government has been secretly doing on our behalf to deal with difficult truths, including exploring anomalous phenomena like UFOs. But every now and then, earth-shaking revelations are made by top-ranking officials of the government about the secrets the institutions they serve are keeping from the tax-paying public. And among such revelations is the recent acknowledgment by the Pentagon that it formed and funded a top-secret and long-running UFO investigation program.
On Saturday, December 16th, the New York Times and Politico published articles which revealed that the U.S. government – more specifically, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – had been funding a secret investigatory program that studied unexplained aerial phenomena or UAPs. It supposedly operated from the year 2007 until 2012 and taxpayers supposedly shelled out around $22 million during its entire five-year run.
Called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, this clandestine effort to study UAPs was initiated by former U.S. Senator and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate majority leader. Reid’s proposed UFO investigation program was backed by the late Senators Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Most of the budget allotted for the program went to an aerospace research company run by Nevada businessman and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow. Not only is he allegedly a close friend of Reid, he is also a passionate believer in the existence of aliens and is said to be the one who sparked the senator’s interest in UFOs and all things extraterrestrial in the first place. Reports also noted that Bigelow provided financial support to Reid’s campaign for Senate reelection in 2004 as well as in 2010.
The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was led by a U.S. military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo. As for what members of the program actually accomplished during its five-year existence, it was revealed that the secret UFO program mainly investigated the accounts of military and commercial pilots who claimed to have witnessed or encountered unexplained aircraft phenomena. Their reported sightings qualified as such if the aircraft they saw appeared to show no obvious or typical signs of propulsion or its flight pattern seemingly defied the fundamental laws of physics. This was not just to find proof of extraterrestrial presence on Earth but also to ascertain if some of the mysterious flying objects were actually secretly deployed by other powerful countries like Russia or China.
The officials in the program also interviewed and evaluated individuals who claimed to have felt or experienced some physical effects from their UFO encounters. But aside from interviewing people, the program supposedly recovered metal alloys and other physical evidence from discovered UAPs and stored them somewhere in Las Vegas.
Out of the program’s efforts, they managed to write a 490-page report about alleged UFO sightings all over the world for the past several decades. This report has yet to be disclosed to the public, and though the program did not manage to yield irrefutable proof of aliens visiting Earth, those who are part of the program, particularly Elizondo, believe that their findings warranted serious attention.
Funding of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was terminated by the United States Department of Defense back in 2012. As for why it had to end, Politico’s article mentioned a former congressional staffer who revealed that while the effort was a worthy endeavor in the beginning, the program failed to find anything of substance. And because they could no longer justify spending taxpayer money to investigate UFO sightings, the program was given a slow death.
However, some of those who supported the program believe that Pentagon is still allowing it to operate in some form and that officials even today are still investigating UAP or UFO sightings reported by service members while also attending to their other duties in the Defense Department.
Luis Elizondo, in particular, resigned from his position last October 2017, and he expressed his frustration regarding Pentagon’s indifference over the merits of the UFO investigatory program and the government organization’s refusal to fund its operations further. Elizondo also decried the government’s excessive secrecy over the subject matter and the internal opposition the program constantly faced. He also revealed that after his resignation, a new official had already been appointed to continue the covert UFO investigations of the U.S. government.
As for what Pentagon has to say about these revelations, the Defense Department, in response to an inquiry by Reuters, confirmed the existence and subsequent termination of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. According to the Pentagon’s spokeswoman Laura Ochoa, the UFO investigatory program ended in 2012 because the department found that there were more pressing, high-priority issues that deserved the funding the UFO program received. As such, the Department of Defense thought it was in the government and the public’s interest to make a change by terminating the program.
But on whether the Pentagon really ceased investigating UFO and UAP sightings, the U.S. defense department’s response is pretty much a non-answer. The organization neither confirmed nor denied that some of its officials are still handling UFO-related issues. Instead, it stressed that it takes “all threats and potential threats” very seriously and that the department promises to take action when they find “credible information” about such threats.
This is not the first time that it was revealed to the public that their government has been secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In fact, the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program is not the only UFO-related project initiated by the U.S. government. Some of this program’s known predecessors include Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, and they all shared similar objectives of gathering data about UFOs and determining whether they posed potential threats to national security and public safety.
Needless to say, this recently revealed UFO investigatory program is not the first of its kind and we can surely expect it won’t be the last. But of course, one can’t help but wonder what other shocking things the government is secretly doing without our knowledge.

  The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only relatively tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars). The Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, being 27% the size of Earth. The giant-impact theory hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a Mars-sized body, dubbed Theia, with the young Earth.

 The current scientific understanding of the origins of life on Earth suggests the concept of universal common ancestry (UCA), which proposes that all life on Earth shares a single common ancestor. While the theory of UCA has gathered compelling circumstantial evidence, there has been no statistical test performed to confirm this hypothesis among the three domains of life (eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes) using molecular sequences.

However, a recent study by Theobald attempted to address this problem by conducting a formal statistical test. The study concluded that the UCA hypothesis holds based on the evidence gathered. It is important to note that while Theobald's study is a significant step towards establishing UCA with a solid statistical basis, some scientists have expressed reservations. They believe that Theobald's test may not be sufficient to reject the alternative hypothesis of separate origins of life.

In summary, the scientific understanding of the origins of life on Earth leans towards the concept of universal common ancestry. While more research and statistical tests are needed to fully validate this hypothesis, current evidence suggests a shared ancestry among all forms of life on our planet.

 1 -7.20635  The laws of gravity, chemistry, and physics that explain the formation and rounding of Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks. From these laws, the amount of mass Earth contains is known, as is the fact that a non-spherical planet the size of Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity. A disk the size of Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape. On a disk strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disk, contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would cause major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk). Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth conjecturists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards. Such a conjecture would also leave open for explanation the tides seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

["The cornea is the clear, outer layer of the eye. It is responsible for sensing visual things. The cornea is made up of several layers, including the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. The epithelium is the outermost layer and is made up of cells that are constantly being replaced. The stroma is the thickest layer and is responsible for most of the cornea's optical properties. The endothelium is the innermost layer and is responsible for maintaining the cornea's shape and hydration. The cornea is unique in that it is the only part of the eye that is not supplied with blood vessels. Instead, it receives nutrients and oxygen through diffusion from the surrounding tissues. The cornea is also responsible for refracting light, which is essential for vision. The curvature of the cornea, along with the lens, helps to focus light on the retina, allowing us to see clearly. In addition to its role in vision, the cornea also plays a critical role in protecting the eye from injury and infection. The cornea is the most sensitive part of the eye, and any damage to the cornea can result in significant vision loss. Injuries to the cornea can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, and exposure to environmental factors such as wind and dust.

  The human cornea is a transparent membrane which allows light to pass through it. The word corneal opacification literally means loss of normal transparency of cornea. The term corneal opacity is used particularly for the loss of transparency of cornea due to scarring. Transparency of the cornea is dependent on the uniform diameter and the regular spacing and arrangement of the collagen fibrils within the stroma. Alterations in the spacing of collagen fibrils in a variety of conditions including corneal edema, scars, and macular corneal dystrophy is clinically manifested as corneal opacity. The term "corneal blindness" is commonly used to describe blindness due to corneal opacity.

 episclera ; stroma ; lamina fusca ; endothelium The collagen of the sclera is continuous with the cornea. From outer to innermost, the four layers of the sclera are: The sclera is opaque due to the irregularity of the Type I collagen fibers, as opposed to the near-uniform thickness and parallel arrangement of the corneal collagen. Moreover, the cornea bears more mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate that has among its repeating units a nitrogenous sugar, hexosamine) to embed the fibrils. The cornea, unlike the sclera, has five layers. The middle, thickest layer is also called the stroma. The sclera, like the cornea, contains a basal endothelium, above which there is the lamina fusca, containing a high count of pigment cells. Sometimes, very small gray-blue spots can appear on the sclera, a harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis.

  It is a faint opacity which results due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial stroma. A nebular corneal opacity allows the details of the iris to be seen through the opacity. A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than a strictly localized dense leucoma, so long as the latter does not block the whole pupillary area. This is because the leucoma stops all the light which falls upon it, whereas the nebula refracts it irregularly, allowing many of the rays to fall upon the retina where they blur the image formed by the regularly refracted rays.

  The sclera, also known as the white of the eye or, in older literature, as the tunica albuginea oculi, is the opaque, fibrous, protective, outer layer of the human eye containing mainly collagen and some crucial elastic fiber. In humans, and some other vertebrates, the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in most mammals, the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show while other vertebrates have distinct colors for both of them. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. People with dark skin can have naturally darkened sclerae, the result of melanin pigmentation. The human eye is relatively rare for having a pale sclera (relative to the iris). This makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking, and the cooperative eye hypothesis suggests this has evolved as a method of nonverbal communication.

  The sclera forms the posterior five-sixths of the connective tissue coat of the globe. It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate (lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers (fasciculi) pass.

 The cornea is an essential structure in the eye that plays a crucial role in vision. It is the transparent outermost layer of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. There are several key characteristics and functions of the cornea that make it unique.

Firstly, the cornea is responsible for refracting, or bending, incoming light to focus it onto the retina. This bending of light allows for clear vision and enables us to see objects sharply. Along with the lens, the cornea plays a significant role in the eye's overall focusing power.

Secondly, the cornea is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels. This avascularity ensures the cornea remains transparent and allows light to pass through it smoothly. Instead of relying on blood vessels for nourishment, the cornea receives oxygen and nutrients from tears and the aqueous humor, the clear fluid filling the anterior chamber of the eye.

Thirdly, the cornea is highly sensitive due to the presence of numerous nerve endings. This sensitivity helps to protect the eye by triggering a blink reflex and causing us to close our eyes when an object comes too close. The corneal nerves also contribute to our ability to perceive pain in the eye, alerting us to potential issues or infections.

Additionally, the cornea is composed of several layers, each with its own specific functions. These layers include the epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium. The epithelium acts as a protective barrier against foreign substances and aids in the refractive properties of the cornea. The stroma, located beneath the epithelium, makes up the majority of the cornea's thickness and is responsible for its strength and stability.

It is important to note that various conditions can affect the cornea, such as corneal abrasions, infections, inflammation, or dystrophies. When these conditions arise, they can cause vision problems, discomfort, or even loss of vision. Treatment options for corneal conditions depend on the specific issue but may involve medications, contact lenses, or surgical intervention like corneal transplant.

In summary, the cornea is a vital part of the eye that contributes to clear vision by refracting light and protecting the delicate structures within the eye. Its transparency, avascularity, sensitivity, and layered structure all play essential roles in maintaining its functionality. Understanding the true nature and characteristics of the cornea helps us appreciate its significance in vision and the potential impact of various corneal conditions. The answer is D.

 the clear, transparent anterior covering of the eye (see also color plates). The cornea is subject to injury by foreign bodies in the eye, bacterial infection, and viral infection, especially by the herpesvirus that causes herpes simplex. The herpesvirus that causes herpes zoster (shingles) can also infect the cornea. Prompt treatment of any corneal injury or infection is essential to avoid ulceration and loss of vision.
The transparent tissue constituting the anterior sixth of the outer wall of the eye, with a 7.7-mm radius of curvature as contrasted with the 13.5 mm of the sclera; it consists of stratified squamous epithelium continuous with that of the conjunctiva, a substantia propria, substantially regularly arranged collagen imbedded in mucopolysaccharide, and an inner layer of endothelium. It is the chief refractory structure of the eye.
The transparent convex anterior portion of the outer fibrous coat of the eyeball that covers the iris and the pupil and is continuous with the sclera.
the convex, transparent anterior part of the eye, comprising one sixth of the outermost tunic of the eye bulb. It allows light to pass through it to the lens. The cornea is a fibrous structure with five layers: the anterior corneal epithelium, continuous with that of the conjunctiva; the anterior limiting layer (Bowman's membrane); the substantia propria; the posterior limiting layer (Descemet's membrane); and the endothelium of the anterior chamber (keratoderma). It is dense, uniform in thickness, and nonvascular, and it projects like a dome beyond the sclera, which forms the other five sixths of the eye's outermost tunic. The degree of corneal curvature varies among different individuals and in the same person at different ages; the curvature is more pronounced in youth than in advanced age. corneal, adj.

It is the chief refractory structure of the eye.
The outer, and principle, lens of the eye through which the coloured iris with its central hole (the pupil) can be seen. The cornea performs most of the focusing of the eye. Fine adjustment (ACCOMMODATION) is done by the internal crystalline lens.
that part of the SCLERA at the front of the eye of vertebrates overlaying the iris and lens. It is a transparent layer of EPITHELIUM and CONNECTIVE TISSUE through which light enters the eye and is refracted so that the lens can then focus it on the retina. The cornea contains no blood vessels, oxygen coming directly from air dissolved in tear secretions, and is therefore easy to transplant as no tissue-typing is required.
Clear, bowl-shaped structure at the front of the eye. It is located in front of the colored part of the eye (iris). The cornea lets light into the eye and partially focuses it.
The transparent anterior portion of the fibrous coat of the globe of the eye. It has a curvature somewhat greater than the rest of the globe, so a slight furrow marks its junction with the sclera. Looked at from the front the cornea is about 12 mm horizontally and 11 mm vertically. It is the first and most important refracting surface of the eye, having a power of about 42 D. The anterior surface has a radius of curvature of about 7.8 m, the posterior surface 6.5 mm, and the central thickness is about 0.5 mm. It consists of five layers, starting from the outside: (1) the stratified squamous epithelium; (2) Bowman's layer; (3) the stroma (substantia propria); (4) Descemet's membrane; and (5) the endothelium. The cornea is avascular, receiving its nourishment by permeation through spaces between the lamellae. The sources of nourishment are the aqueous humour, the tears and the limbal capillaries. The cornea is innervated by the long ciliary and other nerves of the surrounding conjunctiva, which are all branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Innervation is entirely sensory. Within the cornea there are only unmyelinated nerve endings. The density of nerves in the cornea is very high, making it the most sensitive structure in the body. The major structural component of the cornea is collagen, mostly type I, and most of the ground substance between the collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma is proteoglycans whose core proteins bind with keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B). The cornea owes its transparency to the regular arrangement of the collagen fibrils, but any factor that affects this lattice structure (e.g. swelling, pressure) results in a loss of transparency. The cornea contains some 78% water, some 15% collagen and some 5% of other proteins (Fig. C18).

cornea farinata A bilateral corneal degeneration characterized by faint dust-like opacities in the deep stroma. They do not impair vision and are usually age-related.
cornea guttata Dystrophy of the endothelial cells of the cornea which may result from corneal trauma, cataract surgery, keratic precipitates, tonography, ageing, continuous contact lens wear, or as part of the early stages of Fuch's endothelial dystrophy (a disease associated with ageing and with females more than males). It is seen clinically by slit-lamp examination as black spherules in the endothelial pattern. The condition is bilateral, although one eye may be affected more than the other. As the condition progresses the cornea becomes oedematous with a consequent loss of vision and eventually turns into bullous keratopathy. If the degenerated cells are located at the periphery of the cornea they are called Hassall-Henle bodies and are of no clinical significance except as an indication of ageing. Syn. corneal guttae; endothelial corneal dystrophy. See specular reflection illumination; keratic precipitates.
optical zone of cornea See optical zone of cornea.
cornea plana A rare, congenital, usually bilateral condition in which the corneal curvature is flatter than normal with a significant decrease in refractive power. The eye is usually hyperopic with a shallow anterior chamber often resulting in angle-closure glaucoma. There is some degree of peripheral scleralization and it is closely associated with sclerocornea.
Transparent tissue constituting the anterior sixth of the outer wall of the eye, with a 7.7-mm radius of curvature.
n the transparent anterior part of the eye.
the clear, transparent anterior segment of the fibrous tunic of the eye. The cornea is subject to injury by foreign bodies in the eye, and bacterial and viral infections. See also corneal, keratitis, keratopathy.
a congenital flattening of the cornea.
Q. Has anyone had experience with a corneal transplant because of keratoconus?
One of the most common reasons for a cornea transplant is a condition called keratoconus, which causes the cornea to change shape.
This surgery transplants the affected front area of the cornea with a healthy layer imported from an eye bank in the United States.
Many people in Oman who are suffering from infections in their corneas need transplants, but only a few are being admitted to Omani hospitals due to eye injuries.
Although there are some differences between the human and rabbit cornea in the recovering of endothelial function (faster in rabbits thanks to cell proliferation), the efficacy of stem cell treatment of alkali-injured cornea on the renewal of physiological levels of corneal hydration and on the restoration of transparency compared to untreated injured corneas or injured corneas treated with nanofibers free of cells was clearly shown in our rabbit model.
The cornea consists of the epithelium, which are the cells in the outermost layer; the stroma, which is comprised of connective tissue cells; the endothelium, a single layer of cells whose primary function is to maintain the cornea in a dehydrated state to help achieve optical clarity; and the Descemet's membrane, a thin, strong tissue that protects against infection and injury.
Surgeons often seek the youngest corneal tissue available regardless of patient age but historically, some surgeons set extremely restricting upper age limits, NIH said, and pointed out that when the study began in 2000, many surgeons would not accept corneas from donors over 65.
Having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea, we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients.
Before evaluation, cornea should be allowed to come to room temperature.
Transplantation of a donor cornea is the therapy of choice for a great number of those patients.
Corneal Collagen Cross Linking is a technique that strengthens the chemical bonds in one's cornea by applying Vitamin B2 followed by treatment with UV Light.
STEM cells, the body's "building blocks", are taken from the cornea of a dead donor and grown in a lab for around two weeks.

["As the sun began to rise over the vast expanse of the desert, a group of adventurers set out on a journey to explore the unknown. Among them was a young woman named Lily, who carried with her a small, red balloon.\n\nLily had always been fascinated by the way balloons worked, and she had spent countless hours studying the science behind them. She knew that when a balloon is heated, the air inside expands, causing the balloon to grow larger.\n\nAs the group trekked through the scorching desert, Lily's balloon began to heat up. The sun beat down on it, causing the air inside to expand rapidly. The balloon grew larger and larger, until it was nearly twice its original size.\n\nThe other adventurers watched in amazement as Lily's balloon continued to grow, lifting her off the ground and carrying her higher and higher into the sky. They cheered and clapped as she soared above them, her red balloon a bright and vibrant sight against the backdrop of the desert.\n\nBut as the sun began to set, Lily's balloon began to cool down. The air inside contracted, causing the balloon to shrink back down to its original size. Lily landed gently back on the ground, her heart racing with excitement and adrenaline.\n\nThe other adventurers gathered around her, marveling at the incredible feat", 'What would happen when balloons heat up?What would happen when balloons heat up?\nA. they get bigger\nB. they get smaller\nC. nothing happens\nD. they fall down']

The mystical man gives Jerry a cake that tastes of whatever the eater likes best, and replenishes itself whenever the eater takes a bite. However, when Jerry returns to Chubby after finding food for her, the two children realize the kite is gone. At this time it is dark out and night has begun. It is also at this time that Jerry and Chubby meet another mystical creature called a wymp.

  A young boy named Jerry made the largest kite in the town with his own hands. His friend, Chubby – the woodcutter's daughter – painted a moon and several stars on the kite. Jerry feels proud of the kite, and heads to the field to make it fly to the moon. Jerry attempts to fly the kite in the day with all the other boys and girls watching, but unfortunately the kite fails to fly. Jerry feels defeated and embarrassed as the village children laugh at him, and he goes to find Chubby. Together, Jerry and Chubby take the kite and proceed to go on a quest to find someone who knows why Jerry's kite will not fly. As the two set off further into the woods, Chubby becomes unbearably hungry, forcing

The two children and the wymp ride a comet up to the moon, where they find Jerry's kite and meet the shimmering, delicate Lady of the Moon. The wymp disappears, for it is frightened of The Lady of the Moon. The stern Lady of the Moon is not happy the children have entered her territory, and she tells them to leave. Before they are swallowed up by the setting of the moon, the children ride the kite back home, showing all the other children in the village that the kite really could fly. The kite, however, returns to the sky and remains a comet for the rest of time.

At midnight, a dark cloud blinded them, and Dotterine's godmother appeared. She told the king that Dotterine had never been his sister by birth, she was, instead, a princess from a neighboring kingdom, entrusted to his mother by her to raise to protect her from an evil wizard. She vanished, and so did the basket, but Dotterine lived happily with the king ever after.

  The book tells the story of Patricia, her brother Steve, and her cousin Steve spending the summer at their grandparents' farm in Union City, Michigan. Late one night while sitting in their cozy home, a bright light falls from the sky landing in the Gaw's farm with a loud crash. Curiosity overcomes the family as they set foot outside to find a fallen star in their backyard. One line in the book reads, “Of all the places on earth a meteor could have fallen, it landed smack-dab in the middle of our yard, Gramma exclaimed.” This was such a huge deal for the residents of Mudsock Medow. Word gets around quickly, and before long there is a carnival at the Gaw farm. There is a band, a circus, a hot air balloon, and more. The entire town gathers to celebrate the meteor. Many residents touched the meteor claiming it was magical. It seemed like magic to all that the fallen star, which flew through the galaxy, had landed in Union City and brought such joy to all.

 If you’ve got excess pounds to lose but don’t qualify for bariatric surgery, a new non-surgical, fully reversible weight loss option will soon be offered at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
The Obalon balloon system — three swallowable balloons that remain inside the stomach during treatment — was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration following a national clinical trial at 15 sites, including VUMC. The treatment will be offered at the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss by early 2017.
Before participating in a clinical trial for a non-surgical weight loss treatment, Anissa Sanborn had tried multiple diets to lose weight. The photo above was taken before the trial. Below: Sanborn lost 32 pounds during the study and continues to lose weight due to changes she’s made in her diet and daily activities.
Typically, an individual with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 with two comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, or a BMI of more than 40 without comorbidities, is eligible for bariatric surgery. The balloon system is available to individuals with a lower BMI of 30-40, so it is an earlier intervention for treating obesity.
“After gaining weight to a BMI of 30 or greater, there is a significant increase in the number of medical problems that develop — such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol — and there are significant costs associated with taking care of those medical problems,” said Wayne English, M.D., director of the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss and principal investigator for the clinical trial at Vanderbilt.
The system consists of a balloon inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia necessary.
When the balloon reaches the stomach and the capsule dissolves, it is inflated with gas through a micro-catheter still attached to the balloon. The catheter is then removed, leaving the balloon behind. The inflated balloon is about the size of a small orange.
Over the next three months, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. The balloons take up space in the stomach, limiting how much a person can eat. At the end of a six-month treatment period, the balloons are removed through an outpatient endoscopy.
In the clinical trial, 387 patients received either three balloons or three placebo devices similar to the balloon-filled capsules but filled with sugar. Patients in both groups also received dietary and lifestyle counseling. Approximately 65 percent of patients who received the balloon system experienced clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5 percent of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the placebo-control group.
Being overweight was a genetic fact of life in Anissa Sanborn’s family, but after watching 11 family members go through gastric bypass surgery to lose their excess pounds, the 47-year-old working mother decided she wanted to lose weight before surgery became one of the few options to do so.
When knee and joint problems worsened and she struggled with high blood pressure, Sanborn wanted to get the pounds off before she developed more issues. Through the years, she had cycled through many diets and weight loss programs, with little long-term success.
Because her BMI was in the 30-40 range, she didn’t qualify for gastric bypass surgery.
That’s when she signed up for the clinical trial offered by English and his team at Vanderbilt.
Though she wound up being in the placebo group, after her initial trial period was complete Sanborn received the actual balloons for treatment. She received dietary and lifestyle counseling at the center, and she especially credits the advice she received from VUMC registered dietitian Erin Grayson for her success.
Sanborn lost 32 pounds at the study’s conclusion, and through dietary management and increased exercise, she continues to shed weight, having lost 50 pounds to date. In addition, her blood pressure has lowered, so she has decreased the medication she takes.
Sanborn now tracks her caloric intake, finds ways to sneak in exercise such as adding a mini-cycle to peddle under her desk, and looks forward to walks with her husband, Doug, daughter, Kate, and their energetic goldendoodle dog, Charlie.
English is hopeful that the balloon-based weight loss procedure will get patients in the door earlier for help in reversing weight gain, and he is heartened by the possibility that he will perform fewer gastric surgeries in the future because of this option.
Those interested in this weight loss option should contact Andrea Reed at andrea.w.reed@vanderbilt.edu.

On 20 June 2012, Allen tweeted that she was in the studio working with Greg Kurstin on new music. She changed her professional name from Lily Allen to Lily Rose Cooper. In August 2013, she changed her professional name back to Lily Allen and tweeted new music would be arriving "soon". Following the release of Sheezus, Allen experienced an identity crisis and opined that she had lost agency to her label, Parlophone. In 2018, Allen described "Air Balloon" as her least favourite song, and agreed with a fan who suggested that it "stunk of label pressure as a lead single".

 But the vast majority of invasive cardiology procedures aren't aimed at saving lives.About eight hundred thousand of those catheterizations are performed on people in the throes of a heart attack, the patients who generally have the most to gain from an angioplasty or stent.I see it, I see it." "Puff." On the screen, the stent is now in place inside the stenosis. "Inflate," Altschuler says sharply. The technician switches on a handheld hydraulic pump to inflate a tiny balloon inside the stent, expanding the stent to push against the vessel walls. "Fourteen," says Altschuler. "Sixteen." He is counting out the balloon inflation pressure inside the stent. "Down!" The technician turns off the pump with a loud click, and Altschuler quickly extracts the balloon and wire from Crofton's blood vessel leaving the stent behind. At the next puff of contrast, everyone looks to the screen. In the spot where the last picture showed nothing, not a branch or a twig below the blockage, Crofton's arteries are once again filling and emptying rhythmically with each beat of her heart. Crofton's coronary artery is doing its job once again, supplying the heart muscle, that fist-sized pump that keeps us going, beat by beat, day in and day out, with life-giving blood. Technicians and nurses resume their activities around the room. The red line on the heart monitor that had been shooting up and down wildly is now oscillating within normal range. Without comment, Altschuler turns back to his task, rethreading the wire up the catheter into the next blocked artery. Today, more than two million Americans a year find themselves lying on a catheterization table as a flexible wire is threaded through their femoral arteries and into their hearts. About eight hundred thousand of those catheterizations are performed on people in the throes of a heart attack, the patients who generally have the most to gain from an angioplasty or stent. But the vast majority of invasive cardiology procedures aren't aimed at saving lives.Of those 1.2 million elective cardiac procedures, at least 160,000 are "inappropriate," meaning they should not have been done, according to cardiologists' own rules for when to put in a stent or do an angioplasty.When outside cardiologists looked at the patient records from Redding Medical Center, they found hundreds of such inappropriate cases.

All the women said that this was the lost princess. At midnight, a dark cloud blinded them, and Dotterine's godmother appeared. She told the king that Dotterine had never been his sister by birth, she was, instead, a princess from a neighboring kingdom, entrusted to his mother by her to raise to protect her from an evil wizard. She vanished, and so did the basket, but Dotterine lived happily with the king ever after.
 2 -11.32469 If you’ve got excess pounds to lose but don’t qualify for bariatric surgery, a new non-surgical, fully reversible weight loss option will soon be offered at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
The Obalon balloon system — three swallowable balloons that remain inside the stomach during treatment — was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration following a national clinical trial at 15 sites, including VUMC. The treatment will be offered at the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss by early 2017.
Before participating in a clinical trial for a non-surgical weight loss treatment, Anissa Sanborn had tried multiple diets to lose weight. The photo above was taken before the trial. Below: Sanborn lost 32 pounds during the study and continues to lose weight due to changes she’s made in her diet and daily activities.
Typically, an individual with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 with two comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, or a BMI of more than 40 without comorbidities, is eligible for bariatric surgery. The balloon system is available to individuals with a lower BMI of 30-40, so it is an earlier intervention for treating obesity.
“After gaining weight to a BMI of 30 or greater, there is a significant increase in the number of medical problems that develop — such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol — and there are significant costs associated with taking care of those medical problems,” said Wayne English, M.D., director of the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss and principal investigator for the clinical trial at Vanderbilt.
The system consists of a balloon inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia necessary.
When the balloon reaches the stomach and the capsule dissolves, it is inflated with gas through a micro-catheter still attached to the balloon. The catheter is then removed, leaving the balloon behind. The inflated balloon is about the size of a small orange.
Over the next three months, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. The balloons take up space in the stomach, limiting how much a person can eat. At the end of a six-month treatment period, the balloons are removed through an outpatient endoscopy.
In the clinical trial, 387 patients received either three balloons or three placebo devices similar to the balloon-filled capsules but filled with sugar. Patients in both groups also received dietary and lifestyle counseling. Approximately 65 percent of patients who received the balloon system experienced clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5 percent of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the placebo-control group.
Being overweight was a genetic fact of life in Anissa Sanborn’s family, but after watching 11 family members go through gastric bypass surgery to lose their excess pounds, the 47-year-old working mother decided she wanted to lose weight before surgery became one of the few options to do so.
When knee and joint problems worsened and she struggled with high blood pressure, Sanborn wanted to get the pounds off before she developed more issues. Through the years, she had cycled through many diets and weight loss programs, with little long-term success.
Because her BMI was in the 30-40 range, she didn’t qualify for gastric bypass surgery.
That’s when she signed up for the clinical trial offered by English and his team at Vanderbilt.
Though she wound up being in the placebo group, after her initial trial period was complete Sanborn received the actual balloons for treatment. She received dietary and lifestyle counseling at the center, and she especially credits the advice she received from VUMC registered dietitian Erin Grayson for her success.
Sanborn lost 32 pounds at the study’s conclusion, and through dietary management and increased exercise, she continues to shed weight, having lost 50 pounds to date. In addition, her blood pressure has lowered, so she has decreased the medication she takes.
Sanborn now tracks her caloric intake, finds ways to sneak in exercise such as adding a mini-cycle to peddle under her desk, and looks forward to walks with her husband, Doug, daughter, Kate, and their energetic goldendoodle dog, Charlie.
English is hopeful that the balloon-based weight loss procedure will get patients in the door earlier for help in reversing weight gain, and he is heartened by the possibility that he will perform fewer gastric surgeries in the future because of this option.
Those interested in this weight loss option should contact Andrea Reed at andrea.w.reed@vanderbilt.edu.

She changed her professional name from Lily Allen to Lily Rose Cooper. In August 2013, she changed her professional name back to Lily Allen and tweeted new music would be arriving "soon". Following the release of Sheezus, Allen experienced an identity crisis and opined that she had lost agency to her label, Parlophone. In 2018, Allen described "Air Balloon" as her least favourite song, and agreed with a fan who suggested that it "stunk of label pressure as a lead single".

These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft's on-board radar. On 30 December 1978, a television crew from Australia recorded background film for a network show of interviews about the sightings. For many minutes at a time on the flight to Christchurch, unidentified lights were observed by five people on the flight deck, were tracked by Wellington Air Traffic Controllers, and filmed in colour by the television crew.

  The Kaikoura lights is a name given by the New Zealand media to a series of UFO sightings that occurred in December 1978, over the skies above the Kaikoura mountain ranges in the northeast of New Zealand's South Island. The first sightings were made on 21 December when the crew of a Safe Air Ltd cargo aircraft began observing a series of strange lights around their Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy aircraft, which tracked along with their aircraft for several minutes before disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere. The UFO was very large and had five white flashing lights that were visible on the craft. Some people say that they could see some little disks drop

Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission.

 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force.
For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death.
Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world.
"We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S.
Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection.
Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention."
The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years.
Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England.
Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly.
"Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis .
The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone."
"For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah."
Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
"A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash."
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two.
The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two."
While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera.
The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence.
The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996.
"There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive.
"For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen."
These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root.
Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.
Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path.
If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth.
Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds.
"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light.
"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now.
In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water.
The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space.
The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now.
All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago?
To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years.
In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in this region is indicative that this area may have once been an ocean. The agency’s findings using subsurface radar are not surprising but they have added to the existing data gathered from images, atmospheric measurements and mineralogical study of the planet which already previously pinpointed the northern plains to be the site of ancient Martian shorelines.
2012 STUDY ON MARTIAN METEORITES BY MCCUBBIN ET AL.
Within that same year, planetary scientist Francis McCubbin of the University Of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues published a study on Martian meteorites containing hydrated minerals which allowed them to estimate how much water exists today in the Martian mantle. The authors of the study determined that Mars has enough water in its mantle to submerge the planet for as deep as 200 to 1000 meters. This means the planet is currently shrouding around 70 to 300 parts per million of liquid water somewhere beneath its surface.
Then there’s also the study published by the international journal Icarus in 2014 which revealed that a team of geologists found evidence of a vast ancient underground ocean located beneath the surface of Aram Chaos, one of the impact craters on Mars. Around 2.5 billion years ago, about 93,000 cubic kilometers of water supposedly broke through and flooded the surface after the lake ice – which was concealed underground – melted and its ceiling suddenly collapsed.
Here’s an idea how much water reached the Martian surface at the time: they say it is equivalent to around 80% of the free-flowing fresh water that exists on our own planet today.
In 2015, researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, led by planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva, developed infrared maps of water isotopes on Mars which showed the distribution of atmospheric water on the planet - H2O and its deuterated form, HDO. In doing so, they were able to estimate how much liquid water Mars used to have. According to their findings, Mars may have once had enough water to cover up to 20 percent or about a fifth of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. They also suggested that the planet could still contain some subterranean water reservoirs and that the key to finding them lies in refining the infrared maps they had developed.
That same year, another study revealed that NASA’s Curiosity rover – which landed on Mars’s Gale Crater back in 2012 – managed to measure estimates of the concentration of subterranean water on the planet. The new measurements suggested that the soil in Mars is moist with liquid brine. The presence of this liquid brine is supposedly caused by the perchlorate salts found in the soil as it is known to reduce the freezing point of water. The salt is the one responsible for absorbing the water vapor from the atmosphere which then precipitated under the surface. The researchers considered this find as an indirect evidence of transient liquid water on the planet though they insist that the presence of liquid brine is not enough to deem Mars equipped to support terrestrial organisms.
A similar finding was reached that same year by examining the data and images gathered from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO. At the time, the researchers believed that the dark streaks found on Martian craters is actually Martian soil being dampened by briny water, which may have been enough to allow microbial life to thrive on the planet. However, authors of a later study argued against the hypothesis that there is liquid water on the Martina surface, suggesting instead that the dark streaks captured by the MRO’s powerful camera were just grains of sand and dust that occasionally slipped downhill.
An underground layer of water ice was also detected within the planet’s Utopia Planitia region. Researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter again, particularly its ground-penetrating Shallow Radar instrument, which is also referred to as SHARAD. After they analyzed the data provided by the high-powered radar, they discovered a massive deposit of water ice in the area that is much bigger than the State of Mexico. This subterranean ice deposit runs deep – between an estimated thickness of 260 feet to around 560 feet. Fifty to eight-five percent of the deposit is made of ice while the rest is made up of dust and rock particles.
The water ice deposit in Utopia Planitia managed to elude the danger of being vaporized by the planet’s hostile atmosphere because of the thick soil that successfully separated the two. Estimates of the soil’s thickness in this region range between 3 to 33 feet.
Another compelling evidence that supports the theory that an ancient underground ocean is hidden beneath the Red Planet’s surface comes from the reanalyzed data from NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft which has been orbiting the planet since 2001. Researchers found patches of water ice in regions at surprisingly lower latitudes. Should this equatorial ice eventually melt and reach the surface, it is presumed that it would very likely result to the formation of a more accommodating environment that could be perfect for the survival and growth of microbial life.
Despite the vast amount of research that has gone into finding water and life on Mars, many of the missing pieces needed to complete the entire picture of what happened to this unique Red Planet and what remains there now have yet to be found. However, it is safe to say that we know more about our neighbor planet now more than we did before, and most of the information we have learned about Mars has only strengthened our scientific community’s conviction that liquid water once filled a sizeable portion of the planet’s surface and may still be lurking beneath its porous subterranean rocks.
Since the first Apollo mission in 1969, astronauts have since reported strange flashes of light on the surface of the moon that seems to come out of nowhere.
Many scientists have made speculations about the cause and possible origins of the flashing lights but none of them have ever come close to being a definitive explanation.
However, there are some theories that may hold a little weight in explaining the occurrence of these strange flashes. So, in today’s video we are exploring some of the theories as we try to figure out these mysterious flashes of light on the surface of the moon.
As mentioned earlier, astronauts since the first moon landing by Apollo 11 have reported sighting s of flashing lights on the moon’s surface. What’s strange about it is that they have reported these flashes even when their eyes are closed.
In one documentary, the lights were allegedly seen by several of the Apollo astronauts as they approached the moon.
Astronauts who have encountered the lights would describe it as white flashes but there are others that have reported back after encountering lights in different colours such as blue and yellow; and in almost all instances, after they have come back home to earth, astronauts who have come across these lights would still see these flashes under various lighting conditions.
A theory explains why these astronauts are seeing what they were seeing and it all points towards cosmic rays.
Defined as a “highly energetic atomic nucleus or particle that travels through space at a speed close to that of light”, these rays – and how they interacted with the human optic nerve – are responsible for the eyes seeing strange lights in varying degrees of colours depending on how much radiation from cosmic rays the optic nerve has absorbed.
To test this theory, engineers put together an experiment involving a black box that can be worn as a helmet. The box would then have sensors that would detect the presence of cosmic rays.
Astronaut Charles Duke wore the helmet on his next mission and reported back seeing clusters of lights and white streaks the same time the box detected the presence of cosmic rays in his immediate environment.
Another theory explaining the flashes of lights is the existence of cold spots on the moon’s surface. These cold spots have been discovered to have layers of thin ice and frost that, when lights from the sun reflects on it, creates flashing or blinking that may trick the eye into believing that the lights are coming from the moon itself.
Revealed from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO, the data brought back helped researches identify certain areas on the moon’s south pole that are cold enough to have frost formations. These formations are suspected to be located in craters where temperatures can drop to negative 163 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore, the research suggests that the icy deposits on the moon appear to be thin and in patches and may be mixed in with the moon’s soil and dust. Also, the evidence of frost suggests that the moon may either have water deposits for millions of years or may have been brought by colliding asteroids which may also explain how water was delivered on the surface of the earth.
Although, another hypothesis points out that hydrogen may have been present in a different form on the surface of the moon – but the idea that the moon could store water ice is still difficult to confirm and is being looked into for over 50 years now and since 2009 understanding the main composition of these icy deposits are still being studied and remains one of the main goals of the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter.
This is a controversial area of study that mainly involves looking into bright sparks on the moon’s surface, discolourations, or misty patches of lunar fog.
Transient Lunar Phenomenon was a term created by Sir Patrick Moore in 1968 in order to give the sightings credence in the scientific community. However, these sightings have existed for more than a millennium according to studies on the subject.
One of the early records of this phenomenon was traced back to a mistake made in the 16th Century when early astronomers spotted a “daytime star” near the moon but was later on discovered to be the planet Venus.
Fast forward to 1969 to a time when astronomy has made larger strides since the 16th Century; during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong remarked that there was “an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area” of the moon.
After several studies conducted by NASA after the Apollo 11 mission, various photographs and images have been taken and produced in order to find the root cause of the strange lights.
Unfortunately, unlike the sudden flashes caused by asteroids on impact, the illumination on the surface of the moon appears to be much more subtle and harder to trace.
In a study conducted by the British Astronomical Association led by Jill Scrambler, the amount of data used between 1700 and 2010 were impressive and the studies conducted on each of them were extremely thorough as each data from different observers – from amateur to seasoned astronomers – were weighed for reliability.
The result was that at least 2% of the TLP sightings were considered “definitive” and unambiguous”. To put it simply: there really is something happening on the surface of the moon, we just aren’t sure what it is. To this very day, researchers are not clear as to what the real cause of TLPs is.
Fortunately for scientists and astronomers continuing to conduct their research on the phenomenon, a new spacecraft called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer was launched in the summer of 2013 to better explore the surface of the moon and provide clearer explanations about these mysterious illuminations and flashing lights.
SYDNEY (AP) — One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I.
No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week.
While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.
"It was the first loss for the RAN and the first Allied submarine loss in World War I — a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies," Payne said in a statement.
The AE1 made final contact with an Australian ship at 2:30 p.m. the day it disappeared. Mystified villagers on a nearby island at the time spoke of seeing a "monster" or "devil fish" that appeared and quickly disappeared into the water.
For years, the United States government has always tried to maintain a safe and somewhat skeptical position when it concerns the possibility of alien life and likelihood that extraterrestrial beings may try to visit our planet or have already succeeded in doing so. Whenever footage or information on unexpected sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs are released and made known to the public, government institutions are quick to refute the possibility that the origins of these aerial objects are not of this world. Instead, they offer explanations that they deem more plausible, completely veering the public’s attention and curiosity from topics they feel are best left undiscussed. Perhaps this is to prevent the public from descending into chaos because of their misguided fears. Or, perhaps it is to spare the rest of us from having to deal with difficult truths while those in the government covertly act with our best interests supposedly always in mind.
Usually, it’s the former. Most of the time, our excessively creative imaginations and our tendency to get ahead of ourselves are our own worst enemies. Rarely do we get to learn some of the things our government has been secretly doing on our behalf to deal with difficult truths, including exploring anomalous phenomena like UFOs. But every now and then, earth-shaking revelations are made by top-ranking officials of the government about the secrets the institutions they serve are keeping from the tax-paying public. And among such revelations is the recent acknowledgment by the Pentagon that it formed and funded a top-secret and long-running UFO investigation program.
On Saturday, December 16th, the New York Times and Politico published articles which revealed that the U.S. government – more specifically, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – had been funding a secret investigatory program that studied unexplained aerial phenomena or UAPs. It supposedly operated from the year 2007 until 2012 and taxpayers supposedly shelled out around $22 million during its entire five-year run.
Called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, this clandestine effort to study UAPs was initiated by former U.S. Senator and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate majority leader. Reid’s proposed UFO investigation program was backed by the late Senators Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Most of the budget allotted for the program went to an aerospace research company run by Nevada businessman and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow. Not only is he allegedly a close friend of Reid, he is also a passionate believer in the existence of aliens and is said to be the one who sparked the senator’s interest in UFOs and all things extraterrestrial in the first place. Reports also noted that Bigelow provided financial support to Reid’s campaign for Senate reelection in 2004 as well as in 2010.
The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was led by a U.S. military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo. As for what members of the program actually accomplished during its five-year existence, it was revealed that the secret UFO program mainly investigated the accounts of military and commercial pilots who claimed to have witnessed or encountered unexplained aircraft phenomena. Their reported sightings qualified as such if the aircraft they saw appeared to show no obvious or typical signs of propulsion or its flight pattern seemingly defied the fundamental laws of physics. This was not just to find proof of extraterrestrial presence on Earth but also to ascertain if some of the mysterious flying objects were actually secretly deployed by other powerful countries like Russia or China.
The officials in the program also interviewed and evaluated individuals who claimed to have felt or experienced some physical effects from their UFO encounters. But aside from interviewing people, the program supposedly recovered metal alloys and other physical evidence from discovered UAPs and stored them somewhere in Las Vegas.
Out of the program’s efforts, they managed to write a 490-page report about alleged UFO sightings all over the world for the past several decades. This report has yet to be disclosed to the public, and though the program did not manage to yield irrefutable proof of aliens visiting Earth, those who are part of the program, particularly Elizondo, believe that their findings warranted serious attention.
Funding of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was terminated by the United States Department of Defense back in 2012. As for why it had to end, Politico’s article mentioned a former congressional staffer who revealed that while the effort was a worthy endeavor in the beginning, the program failed to find anything of substance. And because they could no longer justify spending taxpayer money to investigate UFO sightings, the program was given a slow death.
However, some of those who supported the program believe that Pentagon is still allowing it to operate in some form and that officials even today are still investigating UAP or UFO sightings reported by service members while also attending to their other duties in the Defense Department.
Luis Elizondo, in particular, resigned from his position last October 2017, and he expressed his frustration regarding Pentagon’s indifference over the merits of the UFO investigatory program and the government organization’s refusal to fund its operations further. Elizondo also decried the government’s excessive secrecy over the subject matter and the internal opposition the program constantly faced. He also revealed that after his resignation, a new official had already been appointed to continue the covert UFO investigations of the U.S. government.
As for what Pentagon has to say about these revelations, the Defense Department, in response to an inquiry by Reuters, confirmed the existence and subsequent termination of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. According to the Pentagon’s spokeswoman Laura Ochoa, the UFO investigatory program ended in 2012 because the department found that there were more pressing, high-priority issues that deserved the funding the UFO program received. As such, the Department of Defense thought it was in the government and the public’s interest to make a change by terminating the program.
But on whether the Pentagon really ceased investigating UFO and UAP sightings, the U.S. defense department’s response is pretty much a non-answer. The organization neither confirmed nor denied that some of its officials are still handling UFO-related issues. Instead, it stressed that it takes “all threats and potential threats” very seriously and that the department promises to take action when they find “credible information” about such threats.
This is not the first time that it was revealed to the public that their government has been secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In fact, the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program is not the only UFO-related project initiated by the U.S. government. Some of this program’s known predecessors include Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, and they all shared similar objectives of gathering data about UFOs and determining whether they posed potential threats to national security and public safety.
Needless to say, this recently revealed UFO investigatory program is not the first of its kind and we can surely expect it won’t be the last. But of course, one can’t help but wonder what other shocking things the government is secretly doing without our knowledge.

Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports that it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw. Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART at Area 51 agree that their work inadvertently

  Identifying unidentified flying objects is a difficult task due to the normally poor quality of the evidence provided by those who report sighting the unknown object. Observations and subsequent reporting are often made by those untrained in astronomy, atmospheric phenomena, aeronautics, physics, and perception. Nevertheless, most officially investigated UFO sightings, such as from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, have been identified as being due to honest misidentifications of natural phenomena, aircraft, or other prosaic explanations. In early U.S. Air Force attempts to explain UFO sightings, unexplained sightings routinely numbered over one in five reports. However, in early 1953, right after the CIA's Robertson Panel, percentages of unexplained sightings dropped precipitously, usually being only a few percent in any given year. When Project Blue Book closed down in 1970, only 6% of all cases were classified as being truly unidentified. UFOs that can be explained are sometimes termed "IFOs" or Identified Flying Objects.

Allen Greenfield confessed in Magonia in 1979 he had become disenchanted with the divisive emotionality and groupthink of ufo culture and worried about the influence of belief he eventually saw in his early work advocating the ETH. He was starting to think the bigger mystery was not what ufos were, but "What are we to make of the whole world-wide rumor complex…what are we to make of the rumor – the ufo mythos?" What was the meaning of all the mythologizing that attends the spread of the ufo rumor?

  UFOs have been reported on Winter Hill. In 1950, a witness described a "dark flat iron shaped object hovering close to the ground" and an encounter with a being that returned to a craft before disappearing. In 1999, in what became known as the "Murphy Incident", a farmer said he saw an object hovering over his cattle field. On investigation, the object moved away and the farmer reported the incident to the police. The farmer returned to the field and discovered the object had reappeared. He reported the incident to the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team (MAPIT), who investigated it. While MAPIT was conducting its investigation, they alleged they were being followed by a man in a vehicle. The farmer reported that he was warned by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but has not been traced since the incident, and the current owner has not spoken about it. The UK government released previously classified information on UFO sightings in May 2006; one picture appeared to show an unidentified object over Winter Hill.

["Inheritance of fur coloration is a common trait in mammals, and it is often passed down from generation to generation. This can be seen in many different species, from domestic cats and dogs to wild animals like lions and tigers.\n\nFor example, in domestic cats, the color of a kitten's fur is often similar to that of its mother. This is because fur coloration is an inherited characteristic, meaning that it is passed down from parent to offspring through genes.\n\nIn some cases, the coloration of fur can also be influenced by environmental factors. For example, a cat that is born with a light-colored coat may become darker if it spends most of its time outdoors in the sun. However, the basic coloration of the fur is still determined by genetics.\n\nIn addition to cats and dogs, other mammals also exhibit inherited fur coloration. For example, in lions, the color of a cub's fur is often similar to that of its mother and father. This is because lions have a complex system of inheritance, with multiple genes affecting fur coloration.\n\nOverall, the coloration of fur is a fascinating and complex trait that is passed down from generation to generation through inheritance. By studying the genetics of fur coloration, scientists can gain insights into the evolution of mammals and the role of genetics in shaping their physical characteristics.", 'How can we see that the coloration of fur is an inherited characteristic?How can we see that the coloration of fur is an inherited characteristic?\nA. puppies have soft fur\nB. kittens look like their parents\nC. all mammals are born with fur\nD. baby rats are mostly bald']

  If one or more genes cannot be expressed because of another genetic factor hindering their expression, this epistasis can make it impossible even for dominant alleles on certain other gene-loci to have an effect on the phenotype. An example in dog coat genetics is the homozygosity with the allele "e e" on the Extension-locus making it impossible to produce any other pigment than pheomelanin. Although the allele "e" is a recessive allele on the extension-locus itself, the presence of two copies leverages the dominance of other coat colour genes. Domestic cats have a gene with a similar effect on the X-chromosome.

   Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible. There are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colours. Camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view. Animals use colour to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to

  attacks by startling predators. Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle, confusing a predator's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly. Some animals are coloured for physical protection, with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn, while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation. Finally, animals can be coloured incidentally. For example, blood is red because the haem pigment needed to carry oxygen is red. Animals coloured in these ways can have striking natural patterns. Animals produce colour in both direct and indirect ways. Direct production occurs through the presence of visible coloured cells known as pigment which are particles of coloured material such as freckles. Indirect production occurs by virtue of cells known as

  In cases of co-dominance, the genetic traits of both different alleles of the same gene-locus are clearly expressed in the phenotype. For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers. Heterozygous chickens have a colour described as "erminette", speckled with black and white feathers appearing separately. Many human genes, including one for a protein that controls cholesterol levels in the blood, show co-dominance too. People with the heterozygous form of this gene produce two different forms of the protein, each with a different effect on cholesterol levels.

  The only difference between hair and fur is semantics. Technically, both are made from keratin, which is also the protein that makes up skin, feathers, nails, hooves, claws, and horns. "'The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles,' says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. 'So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it.'"This remains

   Pigments are coloured chemicals (such as melanin) in animal tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), an example of seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In the case of the flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.

  Coat colors range from pure white to solid black and many other variations. Above is a white American Eskimo dog and a black Belgian Shepherd (Groenendael). A Stanford University School of Medicine study published in Science in October, 2007 found the genetics that explain coat colors in other mammals such as in horse coats and in cat coats, did not apply to dogs. The project took samples from 38 different breeds to find the gene (a beta defensin gene) responsible for dog coat color. One version produces yellow dogs, and a mutation produces black. All dog coat colors are modifications of black or yellow. For example, the white in white miniature schnauzers is a cream color, not albinism (a genotype of e/e at MC1R.) Today, dogs exhibit a diverse array of fur coats, including dogs without fur, such as the Mexican Hairless Dog. Dog coats vary in texture, color, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has evolved to describe each characteristic.

   Agouti is a type of fur coloration in which each hair displays two or more bands of pigmentation. As a result, the overall appearance of agouti fur is usually gray or dull brown, although dull yellow is also possible. Agouti fur is characterized by an appearance of being composed of hairs of different colors, separate from definite markings (although agouti can appear in combination with other markings, such as spots, stripes or patches). This effect is caused by different portions of each hair being visible, such that different colors of the hair's banding is seen, despite hairs actually having similar coloration. This effect produces a very distinctive, finely "speckled" appearance similar to "salt and pepper" hair, as well as an iridescent effect very similar to shot silk which causes the overall color to appear to shift subtly depending on the angle of the light or when the animal moves. Agouti fur is the wild type pigmentation for many domesticated mammals. It is a highly recognized characteristic trait of several animals, including many wild canids, wild rabbits, and the namesake agouti.

 1 April 2006: There is substantial evidence that a pregnant mother's exposure to environmental substances can affect her young. Now researchers have uncovered the first direct evidence that maternal exposure to a phytoestrogen in soy can cause lifelong epigenetic changes--that is, changes in gene activity from processes other than changes in the DNA sequence--in mouse offspring [EHP 114:567-572; Dolinoy et al.]. If the findings hold up, there eventually could be repercussions in several important arenas, including recommendations about what pregnant women and infants should eat.
The researchers made their observations in genetically identical yellow mice. The mothers in the test group ate a diet modified to include a concentration of genistein typical of what people eating a high-soy diet would consume, while the control group mothers ate the same food without the genistein. The diets began two weeks before mating and continued through pregnancy and lactation. At 21 days after birth, the offspring were weaned to a stock maintenance diet, which they ate for the rest of the study period.
The researchers assessed offspring coat color and body weight, traits that can vary with methylation (a mechanism in which methyl groups attach to DNA where cytosine bases occur consecutively). The offspring exhibited wide color differences, ranging from yellow to brown, with varying degrees of mottling in between. The researchers found that these differences corresponded closely with methylation in a DNA region upstream of the offspring's Agouti gene, which determines coat color. The 44 genistein-fed offspring were more than twice as likely as the 52 controls to have brown fur and to have much higher methylation, while they were only one-third as likely to have yellow fur and much lower methylation. Animals that had a blend of yellow and brown fur had progressively increased methylation as brown became more dominant.
For weight gain, the brown mice showed by far the least propensity to become overweight. The other groups, with yellow or various combinations of yellow-brown fur, had roughly the same trend toward becoming significantly overweight. The researchers also found that methylation was evident in many parts of the body, including the brain, liver, kidney, and tail.
The team speculates that the ability of genistein to increase DNA methylation provides a plausible explanation for the lower incidence of certain cancers in Asians compared to Westerners. Nevertheless, the pathway by which these changes occurred suggests there could also be significant adverse interactions between genistein and common dietary supplements such as folic acid, which is added to many foods and recommended for pregnant women. Soy-based infant formulas might also be a concern because of the high levels of genistein present in these products. More research is needed to determine if these worrisome possibilities are correct.

  Brindle is a coat coloring pattern in animals, particularly dogs, cattle, guinea pigs, cats, and, rarely, horses. It is sometimes described as "tiger-striped", although the brindle pattern is more subtle than that of a tiger's coat. Brindle typically appears as black stripes on a red base. The stripes are eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and the base is phaeomelanin (red/yellow pigment), so the appearance of those pigments can be changed by any of the genes which usually affect them. - Eumelanin (the pigment making up the stripes) can be affected by: merle (and harlequin), liver, dilution, greying, and recessive red. - Phaeomelanin

['The amount of friction and the speed of an object have a direct relationship. As the speed of an object increases, the amount of friction also increases. This is because the faster an object is moving, the more force is required to stop it or change its direction. Conversely, if an object is moving slowly, less force is required to stop it or change its direction, resulting in less friction.\n\nIn other words, when an object is moving at a high speed, the force of friction is greater than when it is moving at a low speed. This is why it is more difficult to stop a car that is moving quickly than one that is moving slowly.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if an object is moving through a fluid (such as air or water), the amount of friction decreases as the speed increases. This is because the fluid offers less resistance to the object as it moves faster.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between friction and speed is direct, but there are some exceptions depending on the medium through which the object is moving.\n"""\n\n\nIn this passage, the relationship between friction and speed is described as "direct." This means that as the speed of an object increases, the amount of friction also increases. The passage explains that this is because the faster an object is moving, the more force is required to stop it or change its direction.

  vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats. The expression "1 g = 9.807 m/s2" means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes 9.807 metres per second (≡35.304 km/h). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as 9.807 (metres per second) per second, or 9.807 m/s2. For example: An acceleration of 1 g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 km/h for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of

  Force–velocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched – force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum. This intrinsic property of active muscle tissue plays a role in the active damping of joints that are actuated by simultaneously-active opposing muscles. In such cases, the force-velocity profile enhances the force produced by the lengthening muscle at the expense of the shortening muscle. This favoring of whichever muscle returns the joint to equilibrium effectively increases the damping of the joint. Moreover, the strength of the damping increases with muscle force. The motor system can thus actively control joint damping via the simultaneous contraction (co-contraction) of opposing muscle groups.

  at 1 g and is traveling at 35 km/h, it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1 g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105 km/h, can brake to a standstill in three seconds. In the case of an increase in speed from 0 to v with constant acceleration within a distance of s this acceleration is v2/(2s). Preparing an object for g-tolerance (not getting damaged when subjected to a high g-force) is called g-hardening. This may apply to, e.g., instruments in a projectile shot by a gun.

  Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: "violent" or "unnatural motion", such as that of a thrown stone, in the Physics (254b10), and "natural motion", such as of a falling object, in On the Heavens (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address friction. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation  Aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that

 velocity is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's displacement (distance from the original position) ; acceleration is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position. Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called differential equations. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the "time derivative" &mdash; the rate of change over time &mdash; is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in Newtonian physics:  For example, if an object's position on a line is given by  which is constant.

  The speed of light in a fluid is slower than the speed of light in vacuum, and it changes if the fluid is moving along with the light. In 1851, Fizeau measured the speed of light in a fluid moving parallel to the light using an interferometer. Fizeau's results were not in accord with the then-prevalent theories. Fizeau experimentally correctly determined the zeroth term of an expansion of the relativistically correct addition law in terms of V⁄c as is described below. Fizeau's result led physicists to accept the empirical validity of the rather unsatisfactory theory by Fresnel that a fluid moving with respect to the stationary aether partially drags light with it, i.e. the speed is

  In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. If an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase; and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes. In all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, such as frictional forces, will be present, but if they are of negligible magnitude, the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation. In elastic collisions, the kinetic energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy may be converted into thermal energy. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy (dissipation) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule. Many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy, e.g. an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a heat engine converts heat to mechanical energy.

 The effects of representational friction, target size, and memory averaging on memory for vertically moving targets were investigated in a study. The observers watched an animated target moving either upwards or downwards, with variations in size and velocity on different trials. The target appeared in three different conditions: (a) in isolation, (b) sliding along one side of a single larger stationary object, or (c) sliding between two larger stationary objects.

The study found that the displacement, which refers to the difference between the actual and remembered final position of the target, showed specific patterns. Firstly, forward displacement decreased with an increase in implied friction. This suggests that the perception and memory of the target's position were influenced by the perception of resistance or friction during its upward or downward movement.

Secondly, the effect of target size varied depending on the direction of the target's movement. For descending targets, forward displacement increased with increases in target size. On the other hand, for ascending targets, forward displacement decreased with increases in target size. This indicates that the perception and memory of the target's position were influenced by its size, but the direction of movement played a role in the specific effect.

Thirdly, when a larger stationary object was positioned on one side of the target, orthogonal displacement occurred towards that object. In other words, the remembered position of the target had a bias towards the nearby object. However, when there was no object or when objects were present on both sides of the target, orthogonal displacement was close to zero. This suggests that the presence and location of larger stationary objects influenced the perception and memory of the target's position in relation to those objects.

Overall, these findings provide insights into the effects of representational friction, target size, and memory averaging on memory for vertically moving targets. The study supports previous research and speculations regarding these factors and their impact on memory.

  Fish & Geddes state: "Contact with 20 mA of current can be fatal". The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. Death can occur from any shock that carries enough sustained current to stop the heart. Low currents (70–700 mA) usually trigger fibrillation in the heart, which is reversible via defibrillator but is nearly always fatal without help. Currents as low as 30 mA AC or 300–500 mA DC applied to the body surface can cause fibrillation. Large currents (> 1 A) cause permanent damage via burns and cellular damage.

  An electrical burn is a burn that results from electricity passing through the body causing rapid injury. Approximately 1000 deaths per year due to electrical injuries are reported in the United States, with a mortality rate of 3-5%. Electrical burns differ from thermal or chemical burns in that they cause much more subdermal damage. They can exclusively cause surface damage, but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result, electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose, and many people underestimate the severity of their burn. In extreme cases, electricity can cause shock to the brain, strain to the heart,

  In the Netherlands in 1746 Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from man-made electricity. By the mid-19th century high-voltage electrical systems came into use to power arc lighting for theatrical stage lighting and lighthouses leading to the first recorded accidental death in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France, touched a 250-volt wire. The spread of arc light–based street lighting systems (which at the time ran at a voltage above 3,000 volts) after 1880 led to many people dying from coming in contact with these high-voltage lines, a strange new phenomenon which seemed to kill instantaneously

 The man experienced a life-threatening heart rhythm called torsades des pointes, which occurs when the heart's two lower chambers beat faster than the upper chambers.
A 60-year-old man came to the emergency department after he passed out in public. According to bystanders, the fall happened so quickly that no one was able to catch him before he hit the ground and sustained a facial injury.
In the ED, he was awake, but the fainting spell caused the man to break his nose. We gave him medication for the pain.
He reported having a fever for several days before his fainting. Blood work and a CT scan were ordered, along with a standard electrocardiogram. Results of the testing indicated the man had an infection, which was in line with his symptoms.
When we returned to his ED room after the testing, the man experienced a life-threatening heart rhythm called torsades de pointes, or “twisting of the points.” This particular type of tachycardia occurs when the heart’s two lower chambers beat faster than the upper chambers. He went into cardiac arrest because of the erratic rhythm in his heart.
His care team quickly administered one electrical shock to his heart and began CPR until his heart returned to its normal rhythm. The team continued to monitor the man closely.
This serious development in symptoms signaled to the doctors that something more than an infection was going on. So what could it be?
We took a closer look at the electrocardiogram and the man’s family history. The man had passed out two other times in a similar situation when he had a fever. Further investigation revealed several members of his family suffered unexplained deaths while young.
We determined that the man had a genetic condition known as long QT syndrome. The QT interval is a measurement on the electrocardiogram used to assess electrical properties of the heart. When it is longer than it should be, the result can be lethal heart rhythms, passing out, and sudden death.
There are three main types of long QT syndrome, each with different triggers. One such trigger is fever, as was the case with this patient. In addition, long QT syndrome is passed on from generation to generation in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that there is a 50 percent chance of passing it along. This explained the unexpected deaths of several of the man’s family members.
The man was treated with beta blockers to prevent abnormal heart rhythms, and an internal cardioverter defibrillator, to restore normal heart rhythm in the event he suffers another life-threatening arrhythmia. We also treated him with antibiotics to clear up a urinary tract infection. He was discharged from the hospital three days later.
Passing out without any warning.
Passing out with fever, from startling noises, during sleep, or with beginning new medications.
Any passing out that appears to bystanders like a seizure.
Family history of unexpected death in otherwise young, healthy people.
The man’s case was unique in that typically it is the younger generation that presents with passing out or sudden death, which leads to genetic testing of the older generations. In this instance, the diagnosis of the entire family was made by looking backward.

  Electrocution is death or severe injury by electric shock, electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from "electro" and "execution", but it is also used for accidental death. The term "electrocution" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred only to electrical execution and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.

  In 1983 and 1984, Wimber said, "I had suffered minor chest pains every four or five months. I suspected they had something to do with my heart but did nothing about them. Nobody, not even Carol, my wife, knew about my condition." In October 1985 while in England he was very tired and had chest pains. His wife insisted he get tested. "I had what doctors later suspected were a series of coronary attacks." The next month his cardiologist confirmed he had a damaged heart and told him that his weight and schedule put him at risk of imminent death. "In 1985 I was away from home for over forty weeks." "All my life," Wimber confessed,

  Gage was thrown onto his back and gave some brief convulsions of the arms and legs, but spoke within a few minutes, walked with little assistance, and sat upright in an oxcart for the 3/4 mi ride to his lodgings in town. About 30 minutes after the accident, physician Edward H. Williams found Gage sitting in a chair outside the hotel and was greeted with "one of the great understatements of medical history": "When I drove up he said, "Doctor, here is business enough for you."

Harlow took charge of the case around 6 p.m.: "You will excuse me for remarking here, that the picture presented was, to one unaccustomed to military surgery, truly terrific; but the patient bore his sufferings with the most heroic firmness. He recognized me at once, and said he hoped he was not much hurt. He seemed to be perfectly conscious, but was getting exhausted from the hemorrhage. His person, and the bed on which he was laid, were literally one gore of blood." Gage was also swallowing blood, which he regurgitated every 15 or 20 minutes.

  and was having trouble breathing. "And then Perryhis eyes looked up to the left which I recognize as a neurological sign and then the heart monitor went flat and the team converged". After 45 minutes the team gave up trying to resuscitate him. Rogue Jay Novella remembered conversations he had had with DeAngelis about his health and diagnosis. "He would basically say he's living his life the way he wants to. It was kind of the subtext was 'cause he knew that he didn't have a lot of time and he was doing everything in his power to just make himself happy."

Through the decades, a cup of clover tea was taken, sipped slowly to treat bronchitis, whooping cough, arthritis, gout, psoriasis and eczema, and as a treatment to soothe chronic cough and a postnasal drip. For the postnasal drip, clover tea was often combined with violet tea (see Violet). The cooled tea was used as a wash or lotion for psoriasis, eczema and sunburn. To make clover tea, take ¼ cup fresh leaves and flowers, pour over this 1 cup of boiling water, leave it to stand for five minutes, then strain. The flowers of the red clover, particularly, are used in anticancer treatments, extracts are used in medicines and in creams for external application in skin cancers, and as both are so easy to grow we need to have them growing in our gardens for frequent cups of health-giving teas. Once used extensively as a treatment for constipation, clover tea is still a favourite country remedy in Europe today, and a cup a day of winter tea made by combining rosehips, dried clover flowers, dried mint and honey, is still taken to ward off winter flu, chills and coughs, just as the medieval monks prepared it.

  terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the solvent. Thus, a

Already research has verified lucerne's excellence in treating menstrual problems, menopause discomfort, particularly hot flushes, hot sweats and heart palpitations during menopause, as it has superb oestrogenic activity. It also contributes to the building up of body strength, energy and vitality – it literally acts like a tonic. The high content of vitamins A, D, E, G and K and iron boost energy levels quickly, and students during exam times find lucerne tablets (available from health shops and chemists) invaluable. Arthritic pains are eased and soothed by lucerne tea and alfalfa sprouts eaten in the daily salad, and a particularly potent energiser, very useful after a debilitating illness, and a pain-relieving tea, can be made by pouring 1 cup of boiling water over ¼ cup fresh lucerne sprigs and flowers and 1 tablespoon of fresh alfalfa sprouts. Stand for three to five minutes, then strain and sip slowly. Any lucerne tea left over can be cooled and watered into an ailing plant. It will quickly revive it and promote new growth. **CAUTION:** Doctors suggest that those suffering from auto-immune diseases should not take lucerne frequently. #### **Lucerne vitality boost tea – liquid energy**

Take ¼ cup of fresh lucerne sprigs with flowers, 3 fresh pennywort leaves, 1 sprig of sacred basil with about 4 leaves on it. Pour over this 1 cup of boiling water. Crush a little and stir well with the spoon. Sweeten with a little honey if liked, and/or add a little fresh lemon juice and a little bit of lemon zest. Strain. Sip slowly. This tea will wake you up and get you running smoothly! ### Maidenhair fern

_Adiantum capillus-veneris_

Who would have thought this exquisite pot plant, so loved for centuries in every conservatory and on every shady verandah, could be made into a tea?Sweeten if liked with a touch of honey, and sip slowly to ease coughs, colds, asthma, shortness of breath, catarrh, runny nose, sore throats, chronic postnasal drip, bronchitis and exhaustion.The Zulu people take the tea for measles and chicken pox too!

 Strain, sweeten with a touch of honey, if liked, and sip slowly.Alternatively, make a tea of fresh leaves and flowers by steeping ¼ cup of the leaves and flowers in 1 cup of boiling water for three to four minutes.(The old-fashioned sage tea with honey and lemon is still one of the most popular sore-throat treatments today.) Honey is a wonderful unwinding, calming, soothing and relaxing addition to the herbal teas! ### Anise

_Pimpinella anisum_

Anise is a pretty, quick-growing little annual and the whole plant – flowers included – makes a deliciously comforting tea, and the seeds (aniseed) have been treasured through the centuries as a medicine. One of the best digestive herbs, aniseed has been used to treat heartburn, sour belching, wind, colic and nausea. It will quickly ease hiccoughs, dissipate bloating and is a superbly effective antispasmodic, countering and soothing menstrual cramps, spasmodic tight coughing, whooping cough, bronchitis, pneumonia and heat prostration. Many a nursing mother has sipped cups of aniseed tea to increase her breast milk production (which benefits the baby's colic too). **CAUTION:** Do not take anise in any form during pregnancy. New research is finding that anise tea is beneficial in treating frigidity and impotence and for the easing of the menstrual cycle. The ancient Greeks used aniseeds and fresh flowers for pain relief and recorded that aniseed warms, dries, dissolves, facilitates breathing, provokes urine, eases thirst and relieves pain – and modern research verifies this. Make a tea of 2 teaspoons of aniseeds, pour over this 1 cup of boiling water, leave it to stand for four to five minutes, give it a good stir, then either strain and sip slowly, or chew the seeds well with the tea – they are delicious. Alternatively, make a tea of fresh leaves and flowers by steeping ¼ cup of the leaves and flowers in 1 cup of boiling water for three to four minutes. Strain, sweeten with a touch of honey, if liked, and sip slowly.#### **Aniseed and orange winter warmer**

Serves 2

Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 teaspoons of aniseed and a twist of orange zest.Stand for 5 minutes.Simmer 1 cup of orange juice freshly squeezed with 2 teaspoons of honey for 1 minute.Stir to dissolve the honey.Add the aniseed tea to the pot of orange juice and stir for 1 minute.Strain.

  4._Kushmanda ghruta_ made by cooking _ghruta_ with 18 times its quantity of _kushmanda_ juice and paste of _yashtimadhu_
  3._Samshamana_ therapy does not work well if purification is not made a priority.6 A study by Nagashayana et al.16 establishes the necessity of _panchakarma_ therapy in Ayurveda medication before palliative therapy. Primary therapy described in epileps **y** is oleation ( _snehana_ ) where _narayan tail_ is commonly used followed by fomentation ( _swedana_ ). These are also the preparatory measures for the _panchakarma_ described in Chapter 4. Keeping in mind the particular patient, a physician may use emesis therapy in epilepsy where drugs are suitably prepared; a common vehicle is honey and rock salt followed by a postemesis regimen. Nasal insufflation ( _nasya_ ) is also an important treatment wherein herbal powders and medicated oils are administered in the nostrils as per the case; _vacha_ powder and oil, _anu tail, panchendriya_ _vardhan tail,_ and fresh juice of _nirgundi_ are commonly used formulations.17 _Shirodhara_ is another part of the treatment ( _shiro_ = head and _dhara_ = slow uniform dripping of a liquid substance). This is basically the pacificatory therapy wherein liquid medicaments like medicated oil, _ghrita_ (clarified butter made out of cow's milk), decoctions of various suitable herbs, and buttermilk are allowed to trickle slowly on the forehead of the patient in a supine posture. Formulations used in the treatment are as follows:

  1. _Brahmi ghruta_ containing _vacha, brahmi, kushtha, shankhpushpi_ , and _ghruta_
  2. _Kushmanda ghruta_ made by cooking _ghruta_ with 18 times its quantity of _kushmanda_ juice and paste of _yashtimadhu_
  3. _Kalyanaka churna_ containing 17 herbs 
  4. _Sarasvata churna_ containing 12 ingredients having _vacha_ as the main constituent

The treatment of chronic epilepsy includes garlic with oil, _brahmi_ juice with honey or _vacha_ powder with honey, and _shatavari_ with milk.In the current practice, Ayurvedic physicians use conventional medicines in the acute phase and subsequently _panchakarma_ therapy followed by _rasayana_ therapy to get the optimum benefit for the patient.It is shown that the blood histamine level decreased from 0.9 to 0.37 μg/ml by _vamana,_ and the same is emitted in vomitus.

  The safety testing of explosives involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and safety in use. It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and

  fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world. Thermal safety testing

  impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the Bruceton analysis and Neyer d-optimal test. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will "go"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells. Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that

The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined. Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives: The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance.

  Natural explosions can occur for a variety of reasons. Post-mortem explosions, like that of a beached whale, are the result of the build-up of natural gases created by methane-producing bacteria inside the carcass during the decomposition process. Natural explosions which occur while an animal is living may be defense-related. A number of toads in Germany and Denmark exploded in April 2005. The Los Angeles Herald in 1910 reported a duck which exploded after consuming yeast.

  figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.

  In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as tensile testing, finite element analysis (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.

 In an urban gas setting, several factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage. Firstly, the inadvertent human operation can lead to pentane leakage, which is one of the main causes of the explosions. These operations can include accidents, equipment failure, or improper handling of pentane. 

Secondly, excessive leakage of pentane is often the case when an explosion occurs. This means that a large amount of pentane is released into the environment, creating a highly flammable atmosphere. When an ignition source is present, such as sparks or flames, the pentane-air mixture can ignite and cause an explosion.

Thirdly, the concentration of oxygen plays a crucial role in the severity of the explosion. When an explosion occurs, oxygen in the surrounding air is rapidly consumed, leading to a depletion of oxygen supply. This depletion enhances the severity of the explosion because oxygen is necessary for the combustion process. 

Additionally, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) is another important factor. When a pentane explosion occurs, the high temperature generated can cause carbon dioxide (CO2) to react with carbon atoms, forming carbon monoxide through the reaction CO2 + C = 2CO. The sudden rise in carbon monoxide concentration can have harmful effects on humans in the area, as carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and can cause asphyxiation.

In summary, factors that contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage in an urban gas setting include inadvertent human operation, excessive leakage of pentane, depletion of oxygen, and the rise in carbon monoxide concentration. It is important to prevent pentane leakage, ensure proper ventilation, and have safety measures in place to mitigate the risks of such explosions.

 One of the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives is its effectiveness in assessing the heat damage effect of these explosives. The high temperature and destructive power of thermo-baric explosives make it challenging to measure their explosion temperature accurately. However, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system helps overcome this difficulty.

This system calculates the emissivity and true temperature of the explosion flame using a secondary measurement method. By analyzing the emissions across multiple spectrums, it can determine the true temperature of the explosive reaction more accurately. This capability allows for a more precise evaluation of the heat damage caused by thermo-baric explosives.

Furthermore, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system ensures participant safety during the testing process. It accomplishes this through the use of optical fiber sensing technology and a data acquisition system. By combining these technologies, data collection and transmission can occur up to 500 meters away from the explosion site. This remote operation minimizes the risk to participants, as they can maintain a safe distance from the potentially hazardous environment.

In conclusion, the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives include its ability to accurately assess heat damage and its high level of participant safety. The system's simplicity of operation and better application prospects further enhance its usefulness in this context.

 A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.

Classification

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

Primary injuries
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves. Total body disruption is the most severe and invariably fatal primary injury. Primary injuries are especially likely when a person is close to an exploding munition, such as a land mine. The ears are most often affected by the overpressure, followed by the lungs and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal injuries may present after a delay of hours or even days. Injury from blast overpressure is a pressure and time dependent function. By increasing the pressure or its duration, the severity of injury will also increase.

Extensive damage can also be inflicted upon the auditory system. The tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum) may be perforated by the intensity of the pressure waves. Furthermore, the hair cells, the sound receptors found within the cochlea, can be permanently damaged and can result in a hearing loss of a mild to profound degree. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. Therefore, affected individuals can have auditory processing deficits while having normal hearing thresholds. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound.

In general, primary blast injuries are characterized by the absence of external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion.

Secondary injuries
Secondary injuries are ballistic trauma caused by impacts of flying shrapnels and other objects propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma with visible bleeding. At times the propelled object may become embedded in the body, obstructing the loss of blood to the outside. However, there may be extensive blood loss within the body cavities. Secondary blast wounds may be lethal and therefore many anti-personnel explosive devices are designed to generate fast-flying fragments.

Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries as shrapnels generally affect a larger area than the primary blast area, because as debris can easily be propelled for hundreds or even thousands of meters.  Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries.  In other instances, the target provides the raw material for the fragments thrown into surrounding, e.g., shattered glass from a blasted-out window or the glass facade of a building.

Tertiary injuries
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. Children are at particularly high risk of tertiary injury due to their relatively smaller body weight.

Quaternary injuries
Quaternary injuries, or other miscellaneous named injuries, are all other injuries not included in the first three classes. These include flash burns, crush injuries, and respiratory injuries.

Traumatic amputations quickly result in death, unless there are available skilled medical personnel or others with adequate training nearby who are able to quickly respond, with the ability for rapid ground or air medical evacuation to an appropriate facility in time, and with tourniquets (for compression of bleeding sites) and other needed equipment (standard, or improvised; sterile, or not) also available, to treat the injuries. Because of this, injuries of this type are generally rare, though not unheard of, in survivors. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries.  The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast.  Psychiatric injury, some of which may be caused by neurological damage incurred during the blast, is the most common quaternary injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder may affect people who are otherwise completely uninjured.

Mechanism
Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.

Neurotrauma
Blast injuries can cause hidden sensory and brain damage, with potential neurological and neurosensory consequences. It is a complex clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. Blast injuries usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced neurotrauma.

Individuals exposed to blast frequently manifest loss of memory of events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation.

Blast wave PTSD research
   
In addition to known posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas; in early 2018, it was reported by 60 Minutes that neuropathology specialist Dr. Daniel "Dan" Perl had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), discovering a cause-and-effect relationship between IED blast waves and PTSD. Dr. Perl was recruited to the faculty of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as a Professor of Pathology and to establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine mandated by Congress in 2008.

Casualty estimates and triage
Explosions in confined spaces or which cause structural collapse usually produce more deaths and injuries. Confined spaces include mines, buildings and large vehicles. For a rough estimate of the total casualties from an event, double the number that present in the first hour. Less injured patients often arrive first, as they take themselves to the nearest hospital. The most severely injured arrive later, via emergency services ("upside-down" triage). If there is a structural collapse, there will be more serious injuries that arrive more slowly.

 3 -8.49726  The safety testing of explosives involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and safety in use. It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested.

Thirdly, the concentration of oxygen plays a crucial role in the severity of the explosion. When an explosion occurs, oxygen in the surrounding air is rapidly consumed, leading to a depletion of oxygen supply. This depletion enhances the severity of the explosion because oxygen is necessary for the combustion process. Additionally, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) is another important factor. When a pentane explosion occurs, the high temperature generated can cause carbon dioxide (CO2) to react with carbon atoms, forming carbon monoxide through the reaction CO2 + C = 2CO. The sudden rise in carbon monoxide concentration can have harmful effects on humans in the area, as carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and can cause asphyxiation. It is important to prevent pentane leakage, ensure proper ventilation, and have safety measures in place to mitigate the risks of such explosions. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. Classification

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion. Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries. Tertiary injuries
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries. The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast. Mechanism
Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation. Blast wave PTSD research
   
In addition to known posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas; in early 2018, it was reported by 60 Minutes that neuropathology specialist Dr. Daniel "Dan" Perl had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), discovering a cause-and-effect relationship between IED blast waves and PTSD. Confined spaces include mines, buildings and large vehicles. For a rough estimate of the total casualties from an event, double the number that present in the first hour. If there is a structural collapse, there will be more serious injuries that arrive more slowly. See also

['Frosted window film is a popular choice for many homeowners and businesses due to its ability to provide privacy and reduce glare. Unlike non-treated windows, frosted window film is designed to diffuse light and create a frosted or etched appearance. This not only adds a decorative touch to windows but also provides a number of practical benefits.\n\nOne of the main benefits of using frosted window film is that it can significantly reduce glare. This is particularly useful in areas where there is a lot of sunlight, such as near windows that face the sun. By diffusing the light, frosted window film can help to reduce eye strain and make it easier to see computer screens or read in bright light.\n\nAnother benefit of frosted window film is that it can provide privacy. This is particularly useful in areas where there is a lot of foot traffic, such as in offices or retail spaces. By creating a frosted or etched appearance, frosted window film can help to obscure the view from outside, making it more difficult for people to see inside.\n\nIn addition to these practical benefits, frosted window film can also add a decorative touch to windows. This is particularly useful in areas where there is a lot of natural light, as frosted window film can help to create a more subtle and sophisticated look.\n\nOverall, the benefits of using frosted window film over non-treated windows are clear.

It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. “Superwindows,” mentioned in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and

  Armor Glass International, Inc. was founded by Michael Fjetland, BBA/JD, to "armor glass" under the trademark Armor Glass® to provide security from breach of the glass by natural disasters, explosions, burglars, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, golf balls or other harmful events. One of the main products offered by this company is security film. This type of film is 8 mil thick, is rated for a Large Missile Impact (Level C 4.5 lb.) and is placed on the inside of a window or other source of glass, the weakest link of every building, to create a more durable and defensive layer. Studies have shown that breach of a window by wind-borne debris hurled by hurricane-force winds is what leads to roof uplift and structural collapse. This protective film is used on many buildings in Washington D.C. such as the Pentagon, Smithsonian, Congress, etc. but is also used commercially throughout the world for any person or company striving for extra protection against specific unpredictable encounters.

  therefore have an entire wall that is made of glass, half of which is a floor to ceiling sliding-glass door. The living room actually has three such doors because there is so much glass. When this home was built, insulated glass was not as common as it is today - especially for windows as large as 8½ by 10 feet - and so all the glazing in the house is 1/4" plate glass, with an R-value of 1. Replacing it all with insulated glass to save energy would have a payback period several times the warranty for the new glazing - which has a perimeter seal between its two or more panes, subject to eventual failure.  The original glass, which has no such failure mode, remains clear after 50 years.

Privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window translucent but not transparent. Privacy films for automobiles are available in gradients of darkness, with the darker tints commonly known as "limo tint." Correctly applied mirror film can create one-way mirrors. Note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance. For example, the buildings in a city,

  Thin-film layers are common in the natural world. Their effects produce colors seen in soap bubbles and oil slicks, as well as the structural coloration of some animals. The wings of many insects act as thin-films, because of their minimal thickness. This is clearly visible in the wings of many flies and wasps. In butterflies, the thin-film optics is visible when wing itself is not covered by wing scales, which is the case in the blue wing spots of the Aglais io and the blue-green patches of the Graphium sarpedon. In buttercups, the flower's gloss is due to a thin-film, which enhances the flower's visibility to pollinating insects and aids in temperature regulation of the plant's reproductive organs.

  heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home. Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between

  Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a conducting material with the unusual property that it is transparent, so it is widely used in the flat panel display industry. Reflectance and transmittance measurements of the uncoated glass substrate were needed in order to determine the previously unknown n(λ) and k(λ) spectra of the glass. The reflectance and transmittance of ITO deposited on the same glass substrate were then measured simultaneously, and analyzed using the Forouhi–Bloomer equations. As expected, the k(λ) spectrum of ITO is zero in the visible wavelength range, since ITO is transparent. The behavior of the k(λ) spectrum of ITO in the near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelength ranges resembles that of a metal: non-zero in the NIR range of 750–1000 nm (difficult to discern in the graphics since its values are very small) and reaching a maximum value in the IR range (λ>1000 nm). The average k value of the ITO film in the NIR and IR range is 0.05.

 Smart windows with visible and infrared optical modulation have potential applications in various fields such as environmental protection, energy management, smart camouflage, and display. These windows offer several advantages compared to traditional windows.

One advantage is that smart windows can help in energy management. By modulating the transmission of visible and infrared light, these windows can control the amount of heat and light entering a building. This can help reduce the reliance on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, thereby saving energy and reducing costs.

Smart windows can also contribute to environmental protection. By blocking a significant portion of infrared light, these windows can reduce the amount of heat entering a building during hot weather. This can lead to a decrease in the use of air conditioning systems, resulting in reduced energy consumption and lower carbon emissions.

In the field of smart camouflage, these windows can be used to create adaptive camouflage systems. By modulating their transparency and reflectivity, smart windows can imitate the surrounding environment, making objects or structures blend in seamlessly. This can have applications in military operations, surveillance, and other areas where concealment is desired.

Additionally, smart windows with visible and infrared optical modulation can provide enhanced privacy and security. By controlling the transparency of the window, occupants can have control over the visibility from outside. This can be particularly useful in residential and commercial buildings, where privacy is important.

Overall, the broad optical modulation capabilities offered by smart windows doped with ATO nanoparticles allow for a wide range of applications and provide advantages in energy management, environmental protection, smart camouflage, and privacy.

  covering of old prism transom lights often leaves characteristically tall signage spaces over shop windows (see pictures). Daylight redirecting window film was initially made of one redirecting film and one glare-reducing diffusing film, often located on different interior surfaces of a double-glazed window, but integrated single films are now available. Some daylight redirecting films reflect incoming light upwards off tiny near-horizontal reflectors, so at high sun angles they bend it sharply, throwing it upwards to the ceiling, where a typical ceiling diffuses the daylight somewhat deeper into the space. Other daylight redirecting films refract light at any specified angle, ideally sending it nearly horizontally into the room. Redirecting films can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.

  Window frost (also called fern frost or ice flowers) forms when a glass pane is exposed to very cold air on the outside and warmer, moderately moist air on the inside. If the pane is a bad insulator (for example, if it is a single-pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass, forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear on the bottom of the window even with double-pane energy-efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles, the frost usually forms on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences

['In the darkness, they move with a grace and fluidity that belies their blindness. They navigate through unfamiliar terrain with ease, their bodies twisting and turning as they follow the sound of their own footsteps. They are blind, but they see with their ears.\n\nThese are the echolocating blind, a small but growing group of people who have learned to use sound to navigate their world. They emit a series of clicks or chirps, and listen for the echoes that bounce back to them. By analyzing the time and intensity of these echoes, they can determine the size, shape, and distance of nearby objects.\n\nThe echolocating blind have been studied by scientists for decades, and their abilities have been compared to those of bats. But unlike bats, who emit high-frequency sounds that are beyond the range of human hearing, the echolocating blind use sounds that are within the range of human hearing.\n\nTheir skills are not limited to navigation. They can also identify objects by their sound signature, and can distinguish between different types of surfaces based on the way sound bounces off them. They can even detect the presence of people or animals by the sound of their breathing or heartbeat.\n\nThe echolocating blind have been trained through a process called auditory training, which involves teaching them to listen for specific sounds and to analyze the echoes that', "Some blind people have demonstrated bat-like skills by:Some blind people have demonstrated bat-like skills by:\nA. sensing shapes by light and shadows\nB. having a unusually strong sense of smell\nC. sensing nearby objects by temperature change\nD. using sound to 'see'"]

  Most blind and visually impaired students now attend their neighborhood schools, often aided in their educational pursuits by regular teachers of academics and by a team of professionals who train them in alternative skills: Orientation and Mobility (O and M) training - instruction in independent travel - is usually taught by contractors educated in that area, as is Braille. Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do. Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable vision, many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes. A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student and solid academics goes a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

  People with extreme hearing loss may communicate through sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. "Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information". Deaf culture refers to a tight-knit cultural group of people whose primary language is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or

  Louis Braille attended Haüy's school in 1819 and later taught there. He soon became determined to fashion a system of reading and writing that could bridge the critical gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army. Barbier's "night writing" was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions

  The Riddoch syndrome is a term coined by Zeki and Ffytche (1998) in a paper published in Brain. The term acknowledges the work of George Riddoch who was the first to describe a condition in which a form of visual impairment, caused by lesions in the occipital lobe, leaves the sufferer blind but able to distinguish visual stimuli with specific characteristics when these appear in the patient's blind field. The most common stimuli that can be perceived consciously are the presence and direction of fast moving objects (moving at a speed in excess of 10 degrees per second); in his work these moving objects were described as "vague and shadowy". Riddoch concluded from his observations that

 Humans with echolocation abilities detect objects in their environment by actively creating sounds and sensing the echoes that bounce back from those objects. This is achieved through various methods such as tapping canes, lightly stomping their foot, snapping fingers, or making clicking noises with their mouths. By emitting these sounds and listening to the returning echoes, individuals trained in echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects.

Through this process, they are able to accurately identify the location and size of objects in their surroundings. The ability to perceive these echoes allows them to navigate and interact with their environment effectively.

 Some examples of animals that use their ears for echolocation are bats and certain species of dolphins. Bats have specialized ears that allow them to emit high-frequency sounds and then listen for the echoes that bounce back from objects in their environment. This helps them navigate, locate prey, and avoid obstacles while flying. Dolphins also use echolocation by emitting clicks or whistles and listening for the echoes to determine the location and distance of objects in the water. They rely on their highly developed hearing abilities, including their ears, to interpret these echoes and navigate their surroundings effectively.

 One common misconception about ear ossicles is that they have highly developed muscles, similar to bats for echolocation. However, this statement is not true. Ear ossicles are a group of three small bones located in the middle ear, namely the malleus, incus, and stapes. These bones play a crucial role in transmitting sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.

While the ossicles do possess tiny muscles, it is important to note that their role is limited to dampening excessive vibrations. These muscles include the tensor tympani, which is attached to the malleus, and the stapedius, which is connected to the stapes. Their primary function is to protect the delicate structures of the inner ear by reducing the transmission of loud sounds. However, these muscles are not highly developed like those used by bats for echolocation.

Echolocation is a unique ability found in certain animals where they emit sound waves and interpret the echoes bouncing back to navigate and locate objects in their environment. Bats, for example, use echolocation to navigate and hunt for prey. The muscles associated with their hearing apparatus are highly specialized to produce and interpret these high-frequency sounds.

In contrast, the muscles associated with the ear ossicles in humans are not adapted for echolocation. Our hearing system is designed to process a wide range of sounds but does not possess the capabilities for echolocation like bats or other animals do. Instead, the ear ossicles, together with the cochlea in the inner ear, play a vital role in converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

Therefore, it is not true that the muscles of the ear ossicles are highly developed like those found in bats or other animals that utilize echolocation.

  A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the

['The Cassini spacecraft has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, and has been capturing stunning images of the planet and its moons ever since. One of its most recent discoveries is a new geological feature on the moon Enceladus, which has been dubbed "Tiger Stripes." These are long, narrow cracks in the icy surface that spew out water vapor and ice particles.\n\nThe Cassini spacecraft has also been studying the moon Titan, which has a thick atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and other hydrocarbons. Scientists believe that there may be lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons on the moon\'s surface, and that life as we know it may be possible in such an environment.\n\nIn addition to its scientific discoveries, Cassini has also been used to study the dynamics of Saturn\'s rings. The spacecraft has revealed that the rings are not solid, but rather made up of countless small particles. These particles are constantly being bombarded by the planet\'s magnetic field, which causes them to spiral and collide with each other.\n\nOverall, the Cassini spacecraft has been a major success in the field of space exploration, and has provided us with a wealth of new knowledge and insights about our solar system.\n\n"""\n\n\nThe pull the human planet space rock orbiter has', 'The pull the human planet space rock orbiter has on certain bodies of dihydrogen monooxide results in?The pull the human planet space rock orbiter has on certain bodies of dihydrogen monooxide results in?\nA. telescope views\nB. water level fluctuations\nC. animal\nD. plant harvesting']

  The study of the outer planets has since been revolutionized by the use of unmanned space probes. The arrival of the Voyager spacecraft at Saturn in 1980–1981 resulted in the discovery of three additional moons &ndash; Atlas, Prometheus and Pandora, bringing the total to 17. In addition, Epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from Janus. In 1990, Pan was discovered in archival Voyager images. The Cassini mission, which arrived at Saturn in the summer of 2004, initially discovered three small inner moons including Methone and Pallene between Mimas and Enceladus as well as the second trojan moon of Dione &ndash; Polydeuces. It also observed three suspected but unconfirmed moons in the F Ring. In November 2004

 Rhea is the second-largest of Saturn's moons. In 2005 Cassini detected a depletion of electrons in the plasma wake of Rhea, which forms when the co-rotating plasma of Saturn's magnetosphere is absorbed by the moon. The depletion was hypothesized to be caused by the presence of dust-sized particles concentrated in a few faint equatorial rings. Such a ring system would make Rhea the only moon in the Solar System known to have rings. Subsequent targeted observations of the putative ring plane from several angles by Cassini's narrow-angle camera turned up no evidence of the expected ring material, leaving the origin of the

 Map the surface compositions of Pluto and Charon ; Characterize the geologies and morphologies of Pluto and Charon ; Characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate ; Search for an atmosphere around Charon ; Map surface temperatures on Pluto and Charon ; Search for rings and additional satellites around Pluto ; Conduct similar investigations of one or more Kuiper belt objects The goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the Plutonian system, the Kuiper belt, and the transformation of the early Solar System. The spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres, surfaces, interiors, and environments of Pluto and its moons. It will also study other objects in the Kuiper belt. "By way of comparison, New Horizons gathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at the Red Planet." Some of the questions the mission attempts to answer are: What is Pluto's atmosphere made of and how does it behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How do solar wind particles interact with Pluto's atmosphere? Specifically, the mission's science objectives are to:

No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe &ndash; the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe. Because the disk particles, like

The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies, with two exceptions. One of these is Phoebe (part of the Norse group but named for a Greek Titaness), the ninth moon of Saturn and largest irregular, discovered at the end of the 19th century; the other is Bebhionn, which, though in the Gallic group, is named after an Irish goddess.

On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze, shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young. It contains a pattern of light and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds, where

 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force.
For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death.
Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world.
"We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S.
Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection.
Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention."
The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years.
Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England.
Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly.
"Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis .
The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone."
"For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah."
Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
"A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash."
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two.
The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two."
While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera.
The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence.
The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996.
"There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive.
"For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen."
These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root.
Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.
Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path.
If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth.
Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds.
"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light.
"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now.
In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water.
The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space.
The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now.
All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago?
To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years.
In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in this region is indicative that this area may have once been an ocean. The agency’s findings using subsurface radar are not surprising but they have added to the existing data gathered from images, atmospheric measurements and mineralogical study of the planet which already previously pinpointed the northern plains to be the site of ancient Martian shorelines.
2012 STUDY ON MARTIAN METEORITES BY MCCUBBIN ET AL.
Within that same year, planetary scientist Francis McCubbin of the University Of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues published a study on Martian meteorites containing hydrated minerals which allowed them to estimate how much water exists today in the Martian mantle. The authors of the study determined that Mars has enough water in its mantle to submerge the planet for as deep as 200 to 1000 meters. This means the planet is currently shrouding around 70 to 300 parts per million of liquid water somewhere beneath its surface.
Then there’s also the study published by the international journal Icarus in 2014 which revealed that a team of geologists found evidence of a vast ancient underground ocean located beneath the surface of Aram Chaos, one of the impact craters on Mars. Around 2.5 billion years ago, about 93,000 cubic kilometers of water supposedly broke through and flooded the surface after the lake ice – which was concealed underground – melted and its ceiling suddenly collapsed.
Here’s an idea how much water reached the Martian surface at the time: they say it is equivalent to around 80% of the free-flowing fresh water that exists on our own planet today.
In 2015, researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, led by planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva, developed infrared maps of water isotopes on Mars which showed the distribution of atmospheric water on the planet - H2O and its deuterated form, HDO. In doing so, they were able to estimate how much liquid water Mars used to have. According to their findings, Mars may have once had enough water to cover up to 20 percent or about a fifth of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. They also suggested that the planet could still contain some subterranean water reservoirs and that the key to finding them lies in refining the infrared maps they had developed.
That same year, another study revealed that NASA’s Curiosity rover – which landed on Mars’s Gale Crater back in 2012 – managed to measure estimates of the concentration of subterranean water on the planet. The new measurements suggested that the soil in Mars is moist with liquid brine. The presence of this liquid brine is supposedly caused by the perchlorate salts found in the soil as it is known to reduce the freezing point of water. The salt is the one responsible for absorbing the water vapor from the atmosphere which then precipitated under the surface. The researchers considered this find as an indirect evidence of transient liquid water on the planet though they insist that the presence of liquid brine is not enough to deem Mars equipped to support terrestrial organisms.
A similar finding was reached that same year by examining the data and images gathered from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO. At the time, the researchers believed that the dark streaks found on Martian craters is actually Martian soil being dampened by briny water, which may have been enough to allow microbial life to thrive on the planet. However, authors of a later study argued against the hypothesis that there is liquid water on the Martina surface, suggesting instead that the dark streaks captured by the MRO’s powerful camera were just grains of sand and dust that occasionally slipped downhill.
An underground layer of water ice was also detected within the planet’s Utopia Planitia region. Researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter again, particularly its ground-penetrating Shallow Radar instrument, which is also referred to as SHARAD. After they analyzed the data provided by the high-powered radar, they discovered a massive deposit of water ice in the area that is much bigger than the State of Mexico. This subterranean ice deposit runs deep – between an estimated thickness of 260 feet to around 560 feet. Fifty to eight-five percent of the deposit is made of ice while the rest is made up of dust and rock particles.
The water ice deposit in Utopia Planitia managed to elude the danger of being vaporized by the planet’s hostile atmosphere because of the thick soil that successfully separated the two. Estimates of the soil’s thickness in this region range between 3 to 33 feet.
Another compelling evidence that supports the theory that an ancient underground ocean is hidden beneath the Red Planet’s surface comes from the reanalyzed data from NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft which has been orbiting the planet since 2001. Researchers found patches of water ice in regions at surprisingly lower latitudes. Should this equatorial ice eventually melt and reach the surface, it is presumed that it would very likely result to the formation of a more accommodating environment that could be perfect for the survival and growth of microbial life.
Despite the vast amount of research that has gone into finding water and life on Mars, many of the missing pieces needed to complete the entire picture of what happened to this unique Red Planet and what remains there now have yet to be found. However, it is safe to say that we know more about our neighbor planet now more than we did before, and most of the information we have learned about Mars has only strengthened our scientific community’s conviction that liquid water once filled a sizeable portion of the planet’s surface and may still be lurking beneath its porous subterranean rocks.
Since the first Apollo mission in 1969, astronauts have since reported strange flashes of light on the surface of the moon that seems to come out of nowhere.
Many scientists have made speculations about the cause and possible origins of the flashing lights but none of them have ever come close to being a definitive explanation.
However, there are some theories that may hold a little weight in explaining the occurrence of these strange flashes. So, in today’s video we are exploring some of the theories as we try to figure out these mysterious flashes of light on the surface of the moon.
As mentioned earlier, astronauts since the first moon landing by Apollo 11 have reported sighting s of flashing lights on the moon’s surface. What’s strange about it is that they have reported these flashes even when their eyes are closed.
In one documentary, the lights were allegedly seen by several of the Apollo astronauts as they approached the moon.
Astronauts who have encountered the lights would describe it as white flashes but there are others that have reported back after encountering lights in different colours such as blue and yellow; and in almost all instances, after they have come back home to earth, astronauts who have come across these lights would still see these flashes under various lighting conditions.
A theory explains why these astronauts are seeing what they were seeing and it all points towards cosmic rays.
Defined as a “highly energetic atomic nucleus or particle that travels through space at a speed close to that of light”, these rays – and how they interacted with the human optic nerve – are responsible for the eyes seeing strange lights in varying degrees of colours depending on how much radiation from cosmic rays the optic nerve has absorbed.
To test this theory, engineers put together an experiment involving a black box that can be worn as a helmet. The box would then have sensors that would detect the presence of cosmic rays.
Astronaut Charles Duke wore the helmet on his next mission and reported back seeing clusters of lights and white streaks the same time the box detected the presence of cosmic rays in his immediate environment.
Another theory explaining the flashes of lights is the existence of cold spots on the moon’s surface. These cold spots have been discovered to have layers of thin ice and frost that, when lights from the sun reflects on it, creates flashing or blinking that may trick the eye into believing that the lights are coming from the moon itself.
Revealed from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO, the data brought back helped researches identify certain areas on the moon’s south pole that are cold enough to have frost formations. These formations are suspected to be located in craters where temperatures can drop to negative 163 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore, the research suggests that the icy deposits on the moon appear to be thin and in patches and may be mixed in with the moon’s soil and dust. Also, the evidence of frost suggests that the moon may either have water deposits for millions of years or may have been brought by colliding asteroids which may also explain how water was delivered on the surface of the earth.
Although, another hypothesis points out that hydrogen may have been present in a different form on the surface of the moon – but the idea that the moon could store water ice is still difficult to confirm and is being looked into for over 50 years now and since 2009 understanding the main composition of these icy deposits are still being studied and remains one of the main goals of the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter.
This is a controversial area of study that mainly involves looking into bright sparks on the moon’s surface, discolourations, or misty patches of lunar fog.
Transient Lunar Phenomenon was a term created by Sir Patrick Moore in 1968 in order to give the sightings credence in the scientific community. However, these sightings have existed for more than a millennium according to studies on the subject.
One of the early records of this phenomenon was traced back to a mistake made in the 16th Century when early astronomers spotted a “daytime star” near the moon but was later on discovered to be the planet Venus.
Fast forward to 1969 to a time when astronomy has made larger strides since the 16th Century; during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong remarked that there was “an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area” of the moon.
After several studies conducted by NASA after the Apollo 11 mission, various photographs and images have been taken and produced in order to find the root cause of the strange lights.
Unfortunately, unlike the sudden flashes caused by asteroids on impact, the illumination on the surface of the moon appears to be much more subtle and harder to trace.
In a study conducted by the British Astronomical Association led by Jill Scrambler, the amount of data used between 1700 and 2010 were impressive and the studies conducted on each of them were extremely thorough as each data from different observers – from amateur to seasoned astronomers – were weighed for reliability.
The result was that at least 2% of the TLP sightings were considered “definitive” and unambiguous”. To put it simply: there really is something happening on the surface of the moon, we just aren’t sure what it is. To this very day, researchers are not clear as to what the real cause of TLPs is.
Fortunately for scientists and astronomers continuing to conduct their research on the phenomenon, a new spacecraft called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer was launched in the summer of 2013 to better explore the surface of the moon and provide clearer explanations about these mysterious illuminations and flashing lights.
SYDNEY (AP) — One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I.
No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week.
While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.
"It was the first loss for the RAN and the first Allied submarine loss in World War I — a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies," Payne said in a statement.
The AE1 made final contact with an Australian ship at 2:30 p.m. the day it disappeared. Mystified villagers on a nearby island at the time spoke of seeing a "monster" or "devil fish" that appeared and quickly disappeared into the water.
For years, the United States government has always tried to maintain a safe and somewhat skeptical position when it concerns the possibility of alien life and likelihood that extraterrestrial beings may try to visit our planet or have already succeeded in doing so. Whenever footage or information on unexpected sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs are released and made known to the public, government institutions are quick to refute the possibility that the origins of these aerial objects are not of this world. Instead, they offer explanations that they deem more plausible, completely veering the public’s attention and curiosity from topics they feel are best left undiscussed. Perhaps this is to prevent the public from descending into chaos because of their misguided fears. Or, perhaps it is to spare the rest of us from having to deal with difficult truths while those in the government covertly act with our best interests supposedly always in mind.
Usually, it’s the former. Most of the time, our excessively creative imaginations and our tendency to get ahead of ourselves are our own worst enemies. Rarely do we get to learn some of the things our government has been secretly doing on our behalf to deal with difficult truths, including exploring anomalous phenomena like UFOs. But every now and then, earth-shaking revelations are made by top-ranking officials of the government about the secrets the institutions they serve are keeping from the tax-paying public. And among such revelations is the recent acknowledgment by the Pentagon that it formed and funded a top-secret and long-running UFO investigation program.
On Saturday, December 16th, the New York Times and Politico published articles which revealed that the U.S. government – more specifically, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – had been funding a secret investigatory program that studied unexplained aerial phenomena or UAPs. It supposedly operated from the year 2007 until 2012 and taxpayers supposedly shelled out around $22 million during its entire five-year run.
Called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, this clandestine effort to study UAPs was initiated by former U.S. Senator and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate majority leader. Reid’s proposed UFO investigation program was backed by the late Senators Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Most of the budget allotted for the program went to an aerospace research company run by Nevada businessman and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow. Not only is he allegedly a close friend of Reid, he is also a passionate believer in the existence of aliens and is said to be the one who sparked the senator’s interest in UFOs and all things extraterrestrial in the first place. Reports also noted that Bigelow provided financial support to Reid’s campaign for Senate reelection in 2004 as well as in 2010.
The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was led by a U.S. military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo. As for what members of the program actually accomplished during its five-year existence, it was revealed that the secret UFO program mainly investigated the accounts of military and commercial pilots who claimed to have witnessed or encountered unexplained aircraft phenomena. Their reported sightings qualified as such if the aircraft they saw appeared to show no obvious or typical signs of propulsion or its flight pattern seemingly defied the fundamental laws of physics. This was not just to find proof of extraterrestrial presence on Earth but also to ascertain if some of the mysterious flying objects were actually secretly deployed by other powerful countries like Russia or China.
The officials in the program also interviewed and evaluated individuals who claimed to have felt or experienced some physical effects from their UFO encounters. But aside from interviewing people, the program supposedly recovered metal alloys and other physical evidence from discovered UAPs and stored them somewhere in Las Vegas.
Out of the program’s efforts, they managed to write a 490-page report about alleged UFO sightings all over the world for the past several decades. This report has yet to be disclosed to the public, and though the program did not manage to yield irrefutable proof of aliens visiting Earth, those who are part of the program, particularly Elizondo, believe that their findings warranted serious attention.
Funding of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was terminated by the United States Department of Defense back in 2012. As for why it had to end, Politico’s article mentioned a former congressional staffer who revealed that while the effort was a worthy endeavor in the beginning, the program failed to find anything of substance. And because they could no longer justify spending taxpayer money to investigate UFO sightings, the program was given a slow death.
However, some of those who supported the program believe that Pentagon is still allowing it to operate in some form and that officials even today are still investigating UAP or UFO sightings reported by service members while also attending to their other duties in the Defense Department.
Luis Elizondo, in particular, resigned from his position last October 2017, and he expressed his frustration regarding Pentagon’s indifference over the merits of the UFO investigatory program and the government organization’s refusal to fund its operations further. Elizondo also decried the government’s excessive secrecy over the subject matter and the internal opposition the program constantly faced. He also revealed that after his resignation, a new official had already been appointed to continue the covert UFO investigations of the U.S. government.
As for what Pentagon has to say about these revelations, the Defense Department, in response to an inquiry by Reuters, confirmed the existence and subsequent termination of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. According to the Pentagon’s spokeswoman Laura Ochoa, the UFO investigatory program ended in 2012 because the department found that there were more pressing, high-priority issues that deserved the funding the UFO program received. As such, the Department of Defense thought it was in the government and the public’s interest to make a change by terminating the program.
But on whether the Pentagon really ceased investigating UFO and UAP sightings, the U.S. defense department’s response is pretty much a non-answer. The organization neither confirmed nor denied that some of its officials are still handling UFO-related issues. Instead, it stressed that it takes “all threats and potential threats” very seriously and that the department promises to take action when they find “credible information” about such threats.
This is not the first time that it was revealed to the public that their government has been secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In fact, the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program is not the only UFO-related project initiated by the U.S. government. Some of this program’s known predecessors include Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, and they all shared similar objectives of gathering data about UFOs and determining whether they posed potential threats to national security and public safety.
Needless to say, this recently revealed UFO investigatory program is not the first of its kind and we can surely expect it won’t be the last. But of course, one can’t help but wonder what other shocking things the government is secretly doing without our knowledge.

 The evidence supporting the existence of a geologically active province at the south pole of Enceladus includes several observations made by the Cassini spacecraft. The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has captured images that reveal a distinct region at approximately 55 degrees S latitude, which is circumscribed by a chain of folded ridges and troughs. This region exhibits unique characteristics such as albedo and color contrasts, elevated temperatures, extreme geologic youth, and narrow tectonic rifts with coarse-grained ice.

Additionally, the presence of jets of fine icy particles that supply Saturn's E ring is another piece of evidence for the geologically active nature of this province. These jets are carried aloft by water vapor, which is likely venting from subsurface reservoirs of liquid water. This suggests that Enceladus has internal processes that cause the release of water vapor and fine icy particles.

Furthermore, the shape of Enceladus itself provides further support for the existence of an intense heating epoch in the past. It is believed that Enceladus may have experienced a period of intense heating due to capture into a 1:4 secondary spin/orbit resonance.

Taken together, these observations and phenomena provide compelling evidence for the existence of a geologically active province at the south pole of Enceladus.

Of these, Europa and Enceladus have the highest priority because their icy shells are thinner than the others (Europa's is less than 10 km; Enceladus' is about 40 km) and there is some evidence their oceans are in contact with the rocky mantle, which could provide both energy and chemicals for life to form. Enceladus' ice crust has fractures at the south pole that allow ice and gas from the ocean to escape to space, where it has been sampled by mass spectrometers aboard the Cassini Saturn orbiter with tantalizing results. Titan's ocean is the deepest, at 50 to 100 km, and no evidence for active plumes or ice volcanism have been observed.

  In physics, action at a distance is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the non-local interaction of objects that are separated in space. This term was used most often in the context of early theories of gravity and electromagnetism to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, Coulomb's law and Newton's law of universal gravitation are such early theories. More generally "action at a distance" describes the failure of early atomistic and mechanistic theories which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of quantum entanglement and the mediator particles of the Standard Model.

  Newton's classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. Kepler's observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a Euclidean geometry.) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass. From a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as "a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other

Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall. The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may

 If the force applied at the bracket is doubled, the moment would indeed double as well. Moment, also known as torque, is a measure of the rotational force exerted on an object around a certain point or axis. It depends on two factors: the force applied and the distance from the point of rotation.

In this case, if the force is doubled, it means that there is double the amount of force being applied to the bracket. As a result, the moment or rotational force experienced by the bracket would also double. This relationship is known as the direct proportionality between force and moment.

It's important to note that moment is influenced not only by the applied force but also by the distance from the point of rotation. If the force remains constant but the distance increases, the moment would also increase. Similarly, if the force remains constant but the distance decreases, the moment would decrease.

So, to summarize, if the force applied at the bracket is doubled, the moment would double as well. This relationship between force and moment is essential in understanding the rotational dynamics of objects.

  In the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is g = 9.8 m⋅s−2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is Fg = mg. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object. If an object with weight mg is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance y2 − y1, the work W done on the object is: where Fg is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δy is the change in height y. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.

 A foot-pound is a unit of measurement used to quantify work or energy. It represents the amount of work required to move 1 pound a distance of 1 foot in the same direction as the applied force. In other words, if you exert a force of 1 pound on an object and move it a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work. It is commonly used in the field of mechanics and engineering to measure the energy or work involved in various tasks or systems.

   Energy is defined as the ability to do work on an object; for example, the work required to lift a one-pound weight, one foot against the pull of gravity defines a foot-pound of energy (One joule is equal to the energy needed to move a body over a distance of one meter using one newton of force). If we were to modify the graph to reflect force (the pressure exerted on the base of the bullet multiplied by the area of the base of the bullet) as a function of distance, the area under that curve would be the total energy imparted to the bullet. Increasing the energy of the bullet requires increasing the area under that curve, either by raising the average pressure, or increasing the distance the bullet travels under pressure. Pressure is limited by the strength of the firearm, and duration is limited by barrel length.

2024-06-12 05:09:37 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:This relationship is known as the direct proportionality between force and moment. It's important to note that moment is influenced not only by the applied force but also by the distance from the point of rotation. If the force remains constant but the distance increases, the moment would also increase. Similarly, if the force remains constant but the distance decreases, the moment would decrease. This relationship between force and moment is essential in understanding the rotational dynamics of objects. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of

['Cellular respiration is the process by which cells in living organisms convert glucose and other molecules into energy. This process occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, which are then converted into acetyl-CoA. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, occurs in the mitochondria and involves a series of chemical reactions that convert acetyl-CoA into ATP and carbon dioxide. Oxidative phosphorylation, which also occurs in the mitochondria, involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient that is used to produce ATP.\n\nAll cells in living organisms use cellular respiration to release energy. This energy is used to power various cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell division. Cellular respiration is essential for the survival of all living organisms, as it provides the energy needed to maintain cellular functions and carry out essential processes.\n\nIn summary, cellular respiration is a process that occurs in all living cells and is essential for the release of energy. This process involves three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle,', 'all cells use cellular respiration toall cells use cellular respiration to\nA. photosynthesize\nB. release waste\nC. perform meiosis\nD. release energy']

  In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively), generating additional ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP.

  A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.

  In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH are also produced, which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle. Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. In phase 1, "the preparatory phase", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as "Priming Steps". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates. In Step 7, two ATP are produced. Also, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs is formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.

  majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2 and provides the chemical energy driving the process. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite

 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) plays a crucial role in cellular respiration as the universal energy molecule in cells. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process.

There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. Pyruvate then enters the mitochondrion for further processing.

During the formation of acetyl-CoA, each pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the release of CO2 and the production of NADH, a molecule that carries energy.

The acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle, where it undergoes a series of chemical reactions that generate more energy-carrying molecules including NADH and FADH2.

The final stage, oxidative phosphorylation, occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. NADH and FADH2 donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, which creates a proton gradient across the membrane. This proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.

In summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion.

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is no direct reaction that converts to a sugar because all

 The first substrate of the Krebs cycle is pyruvate. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of cells. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 

Pyruvate is produced through the process of glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. Pyruvate then enters the mitochondria and is converted into acetyl-CoA, which is the first substrate of the Krebs cycle.

The Krebs cycle ultimately produces NADH and FADH2, which carry electrons to the electron transport chain for further energy production.

Therefore, pyruvate serves as the initial substrate of the Krebs cycle, playing a crucial role in the generation of ATP through cellular respiration.

 The conversion of fuel to usable energy in cells involves several processes and reactions. One of the main processes is glycolysis, which breaks down glucose into pyruvate and generates a small amount of ATP. Anaerobic respiration, also known as fermentation, can then occur in the absence of oxygen, converting pyruvate into either lactic acid or ethanol, depending on the organism.

In aerobic respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and undergoes the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During this cycle, carbon molecules are oxidized, releasing energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 then proceed to the final step, oxidative phosphorylation.

Oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain. This process generates a proton gradient, which is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.

Overall, the conversion of fuel to usable energy in cells is a complex series of interconnected reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. These processes generate ATP molecules, which provide the energy necessary for various cellular activities.

  Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions, resulting in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrates substrates. The beginning of this process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, where pyruvate molecules are found. A pyruvate molecule is carboxylated by a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, activated by a molecule each of ATP and water. This reaction results in the formation of oxaloacetate. NADH reduces oxaloacetate to malate. This transformation is needed to transport the molecule out of the mitochondria. Once in the cytosol, malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate again using NAD+. Then oxaloacetate remains in the cytosol, where the rest of reactions will take place. Oxaloacetate is later decarboxylated and phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and becomes 2-phosphoenolpyruvate using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as phosphate source. Glucose is obtained after further downstream processing.

Glycolysis is the initial step in the breakdown of glucose, where glucose is converted into pyruvate. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules.

After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide.

The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient. The flow of protons through ATP synthase leads to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

Overall, these three components work together to convert glucose into ATP, providing the cells with the energy they need to carry out essential functions.

["The Earth's seasons are caused by the tilt of its axis as it rotates around the sun. This tilt, which is approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the amount of sunlight that reaches different parts of the planet to vary throughout the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, during the summer months, the North Pole tilts towards the sun, resulting in longer days and more sunlight. This causes the temperature to rise, and the snow and ice to melt. In the winter months, the North Pole tilts away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and less sunlight. This causes the temperature to drop, and the snow and ice to accumulate. The opposite is true for the Southern Hemisphere. In the summer months, the South Pole tilts away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and less sunlight. This causes the temperature to drop, and the snow and ice to accumulate. In the winter months, the South Pole tilts towards the sun, resulting in longer days and more sunlight. This causes the temperature to rise, and the snow and ice to melt. The changing of the seasons is a natural and cyclical process that has been occurring for millions of years. It is a reminder of the Earth's delicate balance and the importance of preserving it for future generations.", 'Seasons are caused by what rotating on its axis?Seasons are caused by what rotating on its axis?\nA.

  North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun. Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the March and September equinoxes, when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

  Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring

  warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat. Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming. Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.

  On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time. Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter. Places north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year. Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times. The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the axial tilt of Earth. The imaginary line around which Earth spins, which goes between

  Under the right conditions, the normal vertical temperature gradient is inverted so that the air is colder near the surface of the Earth. This can occur when, for example, a warmer, less-dense air mass moves over a cooler, denser air mass. This type of inversion occurs in the vicinity of warm fronts, and also in areas of oceanic upwelling such as along the California coast in the United States. With sufficient humidity in the cooler layer, fog is typically present below the inversion cap. An inversion is also produced whenever radiation from the surface of the earth exceeds the amount of radiation received from the sun, which commonly occurs at night, or during the winter when the sun is very low in the sky. This effect is virtually confined to land regions as the

   The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In

  The North American Arctic's climate is characterized by extremely cold temperatures throughout the year. It also experiences high seasonal fluctuations in daylight, and severe winds due to the Earth's tilt and its polar location. During the year, temperatures can span a widespread range with average lows that reach around -38 °C (-36.4 °F) in winter to average highs that reach approximately 10 °C (50 °F) in summer. The warmest month is July while the coldest month is January. Winters have long dark days without sunlight while summers have days where the sun doesn't set. Parts of the region are covered in ice for most of the year and it can snow during any month of the year. Average annual precipitation is 250mm.

  Because of Earth's axial tilt (often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle, an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called polar night and midnight sun, respectively. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the seasons.

  2.9 days longer than autumn due to the Milankovitch cycles. Apsidal precession also slowly changes the place in Earth's orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur. This is a slow change in the orbit of Earth, not the axis of rotation, which is referred to as axial precession. Over the next 10,000 years, the northern hemisphere winters will become gradually longer and summers will become shorter. However, any cooling effect in one hemisphere is balanced by warming in the other, and any overall change will be counteracted by the fact that the eccentricity of Earth's orbit will be almost halved. This will reduce the mean orbital radius and raise temperatures in both hemispheres closer to the mid-interglacial peak.

  the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean. The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents. The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole

   The core–mantle boundary (CMB) of Earth lies between the planet's silicate mantle and its liquid iron-nickel outer core. This boundary is located at approximately 2891 km (1796 miles) depth beneath Earth's surface. The boundary is observed via the discontinuity in seismic wave velocities at that depth due to the differences between the acoustic impedances of the solid mantle and the molten outer core. P-wave velocities are much slower in the outer core than in the deep mantle while S-waves do not exist at all in the liquid portion of the core. Recent evidence suggests a distinct boundary layer directly above the CMB possibly made of a novel

  The earth is made up of different structures: the crust, the mantle, the inner core and the outer core. The crust, mantle, and inner core are typically solid; however, the outer core is entirely liquid. A liquid outer core was first shown in 1906 by Geologist Richard Oldham. Oldham observed seismograms from various earthquakes and saw that some seismic stations did not record direct S waves, particularly ones that were 120° away from the hypocenter of the earthquake. In 1913, Beno Gutenberg noticed the abrupt change in seismic velocities of the P waves and disappearance of S waves at the core-mantle boundary. Gutenberg attributed this due to a solid mantle and liquid outer core, calling it the Gutenberg discontinuity.

  of the basic perovskite mineralogy of the deep mantle named post-perovskite. Seismic tomography studies have shown significant irregularities within the boundary zone and appear to be dominated by the African and Pacific Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVP). The uppermost section of the outer core is thought to be about 500–1800 K hotter than the overlying mantle, creating a thermal boundary layer. The boundary is thought to harbor topography, much like Earth's surface, that is supported by solid-state convection within the overlying mantle. Variations in the thermal properties of the core-mantle boundary may affect how the outer core's iron-rich fluids flow, which are ultimately responsible for Earth's magnetic field.

   Roughly 97% of the planet's water is in its oceans, and the oceans are the source of the vast majority of water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere and falls as rain or snow on the continents. The tremendous heat capacity of the oceans moderates the planet's climate, and its absorption of various gases affects the composition of the atmosphere. The ocean's influence extends even to the composition of volcanic rocks through seafloor metamorphism, as well as to that of volcanic gases and magmas created at subduction zones. From sea level, the oceans are far deeper than the continents are tall; examination of the Earth's hypsographic curve shows that the average elevation of Earth's landmasses is only 840 m, while the ocean's average depth is 3800 m. Though this apparent discrepancy is great, for both land and sea, the respective extremes such as mountains and trenches are rare.

   The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. On land the crust is known as the continental crust while under the sea it is known as the oceanic crust. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath

   Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth. Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able

  Ocean crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is removed by subduction. The top half kilometer or so is a series of basaltic flows, and only this layer has enough porosity and permeability to allow fluid flow. Less suitable for life are the layers of sheeted dikes and gabbros underneath. Mid-ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. High-temperature interactions between water and rock reduce sulfates, producing abundant sulfides that serve as energy sources; they also strip the rock of metals that can be sources of energy or toxic. Along with degassing from magma, water interactions also produce a

   The simplest model for the shape of the entire Earth is a sphere. The Earth's radius is the distance from Earth's center to its surface, about 6371 km. While "radius" normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the Earth deviates from spherical by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term "the radius of the Earth". The concept of a spherical Earth dates back to around the 6th century BC, but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century BC. The first scientific estimation of the radius of the Earth was given

The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The crust, mantle, and inner core are typically solid; however, the outer core is entirely liquid. A liquid outer core was first shown in 1906 by Geologist Richard Oldham. Gutenberg attributed this due to a solid mantle and liquid outer core, calling it the Gutenberg discontinuity. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical 

  Roughly 97% of the planet's water is in its oceans, and the oceans are the source of the vast majority of water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere and falls as rain or snow on the continents. From sea level, the oceans are far deeper than the continents are tall; examination of the Earth's hypsographic curve shows that the average elevation of Earth's landmasses is only 840 m, while the ocean's average depth is 3800 m. Though this apparent discrepancy is great, for both land and sea, the respective extremes such as mountains and trenches are rare. Earth's outer core is a fluid layer about 2,400 km thick and composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Unlike the inner (or solid ) core, the outer core is liquid.

['In order for crops to grow food safely, pesticides are used on them. However, when it floods, this can cause runoff, which can make the water poisonous. Runoff is the water that flows off of land, usually after a heavy rain or snowmelt. When pesticides are used on crops, they can seep into the soil and be carried away by the runoff. This can lead to contamination of nearby water sources, which can have serious health consequences for people and animals that rely on those water sources.\n\nTo prevent this, farmers can take steps to reduce runoff. For example, they can plant cover crops, which help to absorb excess water and prevent erosion. They can also use practices like conservation tillage, which involves leaving the soil undisturbed as much as possible, and using buffer strips, which are areas of vegetation that help to filter out pollutants before they reach water sources.\n\nIn addition, farmers can work with local governments and conservation organizations to develop and implement programs that help to reduce runoff and prevent contamination of water sources. These programs can include things like building retention ponds, which can help to slow down the flow of water and allow it to soak into the ground, and implementing best management practices, which are practices that are designed to reduce pollution and protect water quality.\n\nBy taking these steps, farmers can help to ensure that the food they produce is', 'In order for crops to grow food safely, pesticides are used on them.

  waters. There are four major routes through which pesticides reach the water: it may drift outside of the intended area when it is sprayed, it may percolate, or leach through the soil, it may be carried to the water as runoff, or it may be spilled, for example accidentally or through neglect. They may also be carried to water by eroding soil. Factors that affect a pesticide's ability to contaminate water include its water solubility, the distance from an application site to a body of water, weather, soil type, presence of a growing crop, and the method used to apply the chemical.

  Agricultural run-off is one of the leading causes of water pollution in the United States. Funding from Clean Water Grants are available to farmers to install projects to help control agricultural pollution before it enters water sources. Methods to minimize and contain water pollution from agriculture in the United States include watershed efforts, nutrient management, cover crops, buffers, management of livestock waste, and drainage management. Buffers are small strips of land covered in plants that are able to remove pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment prior to discharge in a water body. Both buffers and crop covers are used to remove these pollutants from agricultural runoff.

  Discharges and chemicals from agriculture greatly contributes to water pollution in the US, as rainwater flows through fields and into bodies of water. The application of chemical fertilizers, collection of animal manure, and use of chemicals used by farmers results in nitrogen and phosphorus. When washed away from farming fields, nitrogen and phosphorus found in fertilizers can cause eutrophication of water bodies. Eutrophication results in algal blooms which deplete oxygen in bodies of water, resulting in dead zones where life can no longer be sustained. Excessive use or improper use of fertilizers, pesticides, and various types of chemicals during farming contribute to water pollution, and are currently the third largest source for water pollution in lakes, second largest source of water pollution in wetlands, and a major contributor to pollution in estuaries and ground water.

   Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths. Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide. An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The Push–pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).

  In the United States, pesticides were found to pollute every stream and over 90% of wells sampled in a study by the US Geological Survey. Pesticide residues have also been found in rain and groundwater. Studies by the UK government showed that pesticide concentrations exceeded those allowable for drinking water in some samples of river water and groundwater. Pesticide impacts on aquatic systems are often studied using a hydrology transport model to study movement and fate of chemicals in rivers and streams. As early as the 1970s quantitative analysis of pesticide runoff was conducted to predict amounts of pesticide that would reach

  loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations. Fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients. Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources

  soil ecosystem. In general, long-term pesticide application can disturb the biochemical processes of nutrient cycling. Many of the chemicals used in pesticides are persistent soil contaminants, whose impact may endure for decades and adversely affect soil conservation. The use of pesticides decreases the general biodiversity in the soil. Not using the chemicals results in higher soil quality, with the additional effect that more organic matter in the soil allows for higher water retention. This helps increase yields for farms in drought years, when organic farms have had yields 20-40% higher than their conventional counterparts. A smaller content of organic matter in the soil increases the amount of pesticide that will leave the area of application, because organic matter binds to and helps break

  The environmental effects of pesticides describe the broad series of consequences of using pesticides. The unintended consequences of pesticides is one of the main drivers of the negative impact of modern industrial agriculture on the environment. Pesticides, because they are toxic chemicals meant to kill pest species, can effect non-target species, such as plants, animals and humans. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields. Other agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, can also have negative effects on the environment. The negative effects of pesticides are not just in the area of application. Runoff and pesticide drift can carry pesticides into distant aquatic environments or other fields, grazing areas, human settlements and undeveloped areas. Other problems emerge from poor production, transport, storage and disposal practices. Over

 Surface runoff from farm fields during heavy rainstorms can have several potential consequences. One major concern is the erosion of topsoil. When heavy rains occur, the water can wash away the fertile top layer of soil, which is essential for plant growth and agriculture. This can lead to reduced crop productivity and loss of valuable nutrients.

Additionally, surface runoff can carry agricultural fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can contribute to water pollution, leading to eutrophication (excessive nutrient enrichment) and harmful algal blooms. These blooms can deplete oxygen levels in the water, causing harm to aquatic organisms and disrupting the balance of ecosystems.

Moreover, surface runoff may transport sediment and other pollutants such as bacteria or pathogens from livestock waste into streams, rivers, or lakes. This can pose risks to human health if these contaminated waters are used for drinking or recreational purposes.

To mitigate these consequences, various best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented on farms. These include contour plowing, strip cropping, cover crops, and buffer zones along water bodies. These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality.

Overall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.

 The major sources of pollution in the Lake Kinneret watershed include pollution from anthropogenic sources and water abstraction for domestic and agricultural uses. Point-source pollution has been greatly reduced with the development of wastewater treatment facilities. However, diffuse pollution from agricultural activities remains a significant concern.

To protect the water quality in the lake, several management strategies should be implemented. Firstly, there should be a focus on reducing nutrients originating from septic systems, which are considered point sources of pollution. This can be achieved through proper maintenance and regular inspection of septic systems to prevent leakages and ensure their effective functioning.

Additionally, efforts should be made to control pollution from pasture and cropland areas, which are considered diffuse sources of pollution. Implementing best management practices in agriculture, such as the use of cover crops, conservation tillage, and precision nutrient management, can help minimize nutrient runoff and sediment erosion.

Furthermore, promoting sustainable agriculture practices that prioritize soil conservation and minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides can also contribute to protecting the water quality in the lake.

Overall, a comprehensive approach involving cooperation between watershed managers, agricultural stakeholders, and local communities is essential for implementing these management strategies effectively and safeguarding the water quality of the Lake Kinneret watershed.

Methods to minimize and contain water pollution from agriculture in the United States include watershed efforts, nutrient management, cover crops, buffers, management of livestock waste, and drainage management. In the United States, pesticides were found to pollute every stream and over 90% of wells sampled in a study by the US Geological Survey. Pesticide impacts on aquatic systems are often studied using a hydrology transport model to study movement and fate of chemicals in rivers and streams. As early as the 1970s quantitative analysis of pesticide runoff was conducted to predict amounts of pesticide that would reach 

Surface runoff from farm fields during heavy rainstorms can have several potential consequences. One major concern is the erosion of topsoil. Moreover, surface runoff may transport sediment and other pollutants such as bacteria or pathogens from livestock waste into streams, rivers, or lakes. These include contour plowing, strip cropping, cover crops, and buffer zones along water bodies. These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality. Overall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.

["In the animal kingdom, laying eggs is a common reproductive method for many species. However, it is not a typical behavior for all adult animals. While some animals, such as birds and reptiles, lay eggs throughout their lives, others, such as mammals, do not.\n\nFor mammals, the process of reproduction involves the development of a fetus inside the mother's womb. This is a complex and lengthy process that requires a significant amount of resources and energy. As a result, mammals typically have fewer offspring than animals that lay eggs.\n\nIn contrast, animals that lay eggs can produce many offspring at once. This is because the eggs are already fully formed and do not require the same level of resources and energy as fetuses. As a result, animals that lay eggs can reproduce more frequently than mammals.\n\nHowever, while laying eggs is a common reproductive method for many species, it is not a typical behavior for all adult animals. For example, some mammals, such as kangaroos and wallabies, have a unique reproductive system that involves laying eggs in the early stages of development. These animals are known as marsupials, and they have a pouch in which the young develop after hatching.\n\nIn general, it is not normal for an adult animal to lay eggs if it is not a reptile, bird, or marsupial. While", 'is it normal for an adult animal to lay eggs?is it normal for an adult animal to lay eggs?\nA. it has never happened\nB. yes it is standard\nC. it is abnormal and weird\nD. all of these']

Most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation. Caecilians, some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented. In the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6 C-change warmer than its surroundings, which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat. The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are

  in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.

   The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides. This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held, but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs, even when they are unfertilised.

 Some examples of oviparous animals include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, monotremes (egg-laying mammals), and most insects and arachnids. Oviparous animals have different reproductive methods depending on their habitat and species.

Land-dwelling oviparous animals, such as reptiles and insects, undergo internal fertilization before laying eggs. This means that the male's sperm fertilizes the female's eggs inside her body before they are laid. The eggs are then protected by a shell or other protective covering until they hatch.

On the other hand, water-dwelling oviparous animals like fish and amphibians lay their eggs before fertilization takes place. In a process called external fertilization, the male releases his sperm onto the newly laid eggs. This typically occurs in aquatic environments where it is easier for the sperm to reach the eggs.

It is important to note that while most oviparous animals follow these general patterns of reproduction, there can be variations within each group. For example, some reptiles may retain their eggs inside their bodies until they are ready to hatch (ovoviviparity) rather than laying them externally.

Overall, understanding the reproductive methods of oviparous animals helps us appreciate the diversity and adaptability of different species in nature.

  spurs and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.

 In oviparous animals, such as birds, most fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, the development of eggs involves several stages. The ova, or egg cells, undergo a process called oogenesis where they develop protective layers within the female's body. These protective layers help to ensure the survival and development of the embryo inside.

Once the eggs are fully developed, they pass through the oviduct and are either fertilized internally by male sperm (in birds) or externally (in many fishes). Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg cell and combines its genetic material with that of the egg.

After fertilization, an embryo begins to form within the egg. The embryo is nourished by nutrients contained in the yolk of the egg. These nutrients provide essential energy and building blocks for the developing embryo.

As development progresses, various structures and organs form within the embryo. This process is regulated by genetic instructions encoded in the DNA of both parents. The cytoplasm and mitochondria present in the egg cell play a crucial role in supporting this development.

Eventually, after a period of incubation specific to each species, the fully developed embryo hatches from the egg. Hatching typically occurs outside of the mother's body. At this point, it transitions into an independent organism capable of surviving on its own.

It's important to note that while oviparous animals reproduce through eggs and external fertilization or internal fertilization followed by laying eggs, not all animals follow this reproductive strategy. Different species have evolved diverse reproductive strategies based on their environmental adaptations and evolutionary history.

  Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage. Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. Older sources, particularly before the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as "higher vertebrates" and anamniotes as "lower vertebrates", based on the antiquated idea of the evolutionary great chain of being. The term amniote comes from the Greek ἀμνίον amnion, "membrane surrounding the fetus", and earlier "bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught", from ἀμνός amnos, "lamb". The amnion comprises several extensive membranes. In eutherian mammals (such as humans), these include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. The

  While workers cannot produce other workers or queens, the unfertilized eggs that they lay can become males. At around the same time that the queen begins to lay eggs that will develop into males, the workers' ovaries, those "house bees" who stay in the nest, begin to develop. As workers try to lay eggs of their own, there is increased aggression among workers and among workers and queens. These workers may even try to eat the eggs laid by the queen and if they are persistent enough, will be successful in laying eggs of their own.

 The process of birth in mammals, also known as parturition, is initiated by hormones that cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract. These contractions help expel the fetus when it has reached a developmental stage where it is ready to feed and breathe on its own. The mother typically goes through stages of labor, including dilation of the cervix and contractions, until the fetus is delivered.

In some mammalian species, such as sheep (lambing), the mother licks the first lamb while giving birth to the second. This behavior helps stimulate breathing and bonding with the newborns. 

It's important to note that not all animals give birth in the same way as mammals. In marsupials, such as kangaroos and koalas, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period. The underdeveloped offspring then continues to develop further inside its mother's pouch.

Additionally, there are other animal species like reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates that carry their developing young inside them. Some of these species are ovoviviparous, meaning that eggs hatch inside the mother's body before being born. Others are viviparous, where embryos develop internally until they are ready for birth.

Overall, different animal species have evolved various ways to bring forth their offspring based on their specific reproductive strategies and environmental adaptations.

  What makes these frogs unique among all frog species is their form of parental care. Following external fertilization by the male, the female would take the eggs or embryos into her mouth and swallow them. It is not clear whether the eggs were laid on the land or in the water, as it was never observed before their extinction. Eggs found in females measured up to 5.1 mm in diameter and had large yolk supplies. These large supplies are common among species that live entirely off yolk during their development. Most female frogs had around 40 ripe eggs, almost double that of the number of juveniles ever found in the stomach (21–26).

  The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides. In some mammalian species, such as sheep (lambing), the mother licks the first lamb while giving birth to the second. It's important to note that not all animals give birth in the same way as mammals. Additionally, there are other animal species like reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates that carry their developing young inside them. Some of these species are ovoviviparous, meaning that eggs hatch inside the mother's body before being born. Overall, different animal species have evolved various ways to bring forth their offspring based on their specific reproductive strategies and environmental adaptations. Reference:
- Lambing: The mother licks...the case of mammals

In oviparous animals, such as birds, most fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, the development of eggs involves several stages. Once the eggs are fully developed, they pass through the oviduct and are either fertilized internally by male sperm (in birds) or externally (in many fishes). Eventually, after a period of incubation specific to each species, the fully developed embryo hatches from the egg. It's important to note that while oviparous animals reproduce through eggs and external fertilization or internal fertilization followed by laying eggs, not all animals follow this reproductive strategy. Different species have evolved diverse reproductive strategies based on their environmental adaptations and evolutionary history. Reference:

['In a lake environment, organic remains are preserved through a process called fossilization. This occurs when the remains become buried under sediment and are protected from decay and erosion. Over time, the sediment compresses and hardens, forming rock layers that contain the fossils. Fossilization is a slow and rare process, but it can result in the preservation of incredibly detailed and intricate specimens.\n\nThe key factors that contribute to fossilization in a lake environment are the presence of sediment, the absence of oxygen, and the lack of disturbance. The sediment helps to protect the remains from scavengers and other natural processes that would otherwise break them down. The absence of oxygen prevents the growth of bacteria and other organisms that would otherwise decompose the remains. And the lack of disturbance ensures that the remains remain in place and are not dislodged or moved.\n\nIn addition to fossilization, a lake environment can also result in the bleaching of organic remains. This occurs when the remains are exposed to sunlight and other environmental factors that cause them to lose their color and become discolored. However, bleaching does not necessarily result in the destruction of the remains, and they can still be preserved through other means.\n\nOverall, a lake environment is an ideal setup for the preservation of organic remains through fossilization. The slow and steady process of sedimentation and compression can result in', 'A lake environment is a good setup for what to happen to organic remains?A lake environment is a good setup for what to happen to organic remains?\nA. bleaching\nB. burning\nC. fossilization\nD. drying']

  The rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the overlying sediment was cemented, whereupon ash or sand slumped in to fill the void, leaving a cast of the organism's underside. Conversely, quilted fossils tended to decompose after the cementation of the overlying sediment; hence their upper surfaces are preserved. Their more resistant nature is reflected in the fact that, in rare occasions, quilted fossils are found within storm beds as the high-energy sedimentation did not destroy them as it would have the less-resistant discs. Further, in some cases, the bacterial precipitation of minerals formed a "death mask", ultimately leaving a positive, cast-like impression of the organism.

  Wood recovered from a marine environment is referred to archaeological waterlogged wood. Waterlogged wood is defined as wood that does not contain or contains a small amount of air within its cells (capillaries and micro-capillaries). Archaeological Waterlogged normally looks well preserved; however, it is very weak and deteriorates because of the soluble water substance making it dissolve in marine environments. The cellulose of the wood goes through the process of hydrolysis and attacked by anaerobic bacteria that decompose the wood, leaving it only with the lignin network. Over an extended period of time the lignin network will also decompose. The result of the decomposition of cellulose and lignin will increase in the space between cells and the molecules within cells, this will render the wood

The artifacts found on-site are also susceptible to these agents of deterioration, mainly air, humidity, natural light, and climatic changes. In Herculaneum, the carbonized remains of objects once exposed deteriorated within days. Only when a protective agent (lampblack) was applied were they able to survive in the open. In Herculaneum, the skeletal remains of 300 humans were found along the ancient shoreline left exposed to the elements, due to a lack of funding, they are at risk of further deterioration. While some of the damage is irreparable, the issues of funding and threat mitigation have prompted conservation and restoration specialists to reexamine and enact proper protocol in order to prevent future harm to the objects and the site itself

  The term subfossil can be used to refer to remains, such as bones, nests, or defecations, whose fossilization process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal involved was living is too short (less than 10,000 years) or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization. Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years. The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA, protein, or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology. Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering can alter the state of preservation.

When wood is found in a marine environment, it is recommended to have secured the required conditions for its conservation (water-filled pool or vessel) to extract the wood from water, to prevent the wood from dehydration.

   Permineralization is a process of fossilization that occurs when an organism is buried. The empty spaces within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich groundwater. Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying the empty spaces. This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the cell wall of a plant cell. Small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by scavengers or decomposition. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of skin, feathers or even soft tissues. This is a form of diagenesis.

  The preservation of these fossils is one of their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them

Other than ancient studies, this approach can be used to understand current animal diversity with relatively high sensitivity. While typical water samples can have the DNA degrade relatively quickly, the aquatic sediment samples can have useful DNA two months after the species was present. One problem with aquatic sediments is that it is unknown where the organism deposited the eDNA as it could have moved in the water column.

  Analyses of ancient DNA preserved in various archives have transformed understanding of the evolution of species and ecosystems. Whilst earlier studies have concentrated on DNA extracted from taxonomically constrained samples (such as bones or frozen tissue), advances in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics now allow the analysis of ancient DNA extracted from sedimentary archives, so called sedaDNA. The accumulation and preservation of sedaDNA buried in land and lake sediments have been subject to active research and interpretation. However, studying the deposition of DNA on the ocean floor and its preservation in marine sediments is more complex because the DNA has to travel

['In the heart of the Sahara, a man-made kite is changing lives.\nThe Berber people of the Sahara have long used camels to carry water from distant oases. But now, thanks to a new invention, they can harness the power of the wind to do the same.\nThe kite, called a "Berber Kite for Water," is the brainchild of French engineer Artemis Rousseau. It\'s a 1,000-square-foot kite that can be flown by a single person.\nThe kite is made of lightweight materials, including a carbon-fiber frame, ripstop nylon fabric, and a kevlar line. It\'s designed to fly at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, where the winds are strongest.\nThe kite is equipped with a water pump that can draw water from a well or other source and deliver it to a storage tank. The tank can hold up to 1,000 liters of water, which is enough to provide a family of four with drinking water for a month.\nThe Berber Kite for Water has already been tested in the Sahara, and the results have been impressive. In one test, the kite was able to pump 1,000 liters of water in just 10 hours.\nThe', 'What type of useful product can be made from the moving winds?What type of useful product can be made from the moving winds?\nA. wood\nB. bananas\nC. electricity\nD. metal']

  A variant of towed tubing dubbed "kite tubing" has begun to emerge. When tubes being towed on water reach high speeds, they may take flight. This is because the body of the tube acts as an airfoil and creates lift. In this way, the tube becomes a kite. A tube's ability to achieve and maintain flight depends on a number of factors including the speed at which the tube is traveling, the shape and size of the tube, the weight of the rider, and how the tube itself is oriented. As most tubes are not designed for flight, the rider often has little or no control over a tube after it

  of the tribe. Today, the prize is money and prestige. The equestrian display is thought to represent the relationship between man and nature and man and horse. For male riders, it is a representation of their warrior prowess, but there is a single woman who participates in the practice. The practice is rumored to be a variation of the Afghan buzkashi game that the Moulay Abdeslam saw in Asia and brought to Morocco where it was integrated with local customs. For the past nine years, the Baraka family, descendants of Moulay Abdeslam, have revitalized the tradition and sponsored the annual competition in association with the Alamiya Laaroussia Association and the UNESCO International Festival of Cultural Diversity. The festival also exhibits over 45 cooperatives in the region to promote the local handicrafts and products.

   Designs often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed polyester rather than silk. Tails are used for some single-line kite designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a turbine. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be 50 feet long or more. Modern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.

  Mata is an equestrian game and performance performed by the Beni Arous tribe typically in May or June in the village of Znied, in the municipality of Larbaa Aicha, in the province of Larache, Morocco. The competition takes place in the hills upon the tomb of the Sufi saint Moulay Abdeslam ben Machich with over 200 participants. Over the course of three days, tribal teams on horses ride bareback and vie for control of a female puppet, which symbolizes the fertility of the spring season, and take it across the finish line. Women typically fashion the puppet out of tissue and traditional fabrics, making it smell of roses and drawing a face on the doll. Historically, the rider who brought the puppet across the finish line was given the hand of the most beautiful

  A Bermuda kite is a kite made using traditional geometric designs, are quite colorful, and is an art form as much as a recreational tool. They are traditionally flown in Bermuda only at Easter. The kites are typically hexagonal, though larger examples, particularly, may be octagonal, or have even more sides. They are constructed from flat sticks arrayed like spokes of a wheel, with a nail at the axis. A string passes around the ends of the sticks, marking out the edges, and concentric strings are arranged inside of this, all contributing to the rigidity of the structure. Colored tissue paper is glued into the spaces created between strings and sticks. Using different colors, patterns are created. The kite has a single stick secured at one end to the axis, and rising at a

 Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes ; Kites may be maneuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically ; There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together  Kites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient foil-type kites such as power kites can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, kite boating and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years. Kite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:

  foils are closed-cell, where a one-way valve locks the air inside the cells, giving some increased water relaunch capability. Leading edge inflatable kites (LEIs) are made of a single skin of fabric with, as the name suggests, an inflated tubular leading edge and inflated ribs. The leading edge and ribs are inflated by the user with a pump prior to launching the kite. The profile of an LEI type kite comes from the inflatable edge and ribs. LEI kites are primarily used for kitesurfing, as they retain their structure when wet and can be easily relaunched from the water after sitting on the surface for an extended period. Conversely, an open-celled foil kite crashed into the sea immediately becomes saturated with water and unflyable.

  Takoba (also takuba or takouba) is the sword that is used across the western Sahel and among ethnic groups such as the Tuareg, the Hausa, and the Fulani. It usually measures about one meter in length. Takoba blades are straight and double edged with a pronounced tapering from the guard towards the tip; they can exhibit several notable features, including three or more hand-ground fuller grooves and a rounded point. Since the Tuareg have an aversion to touching iron, the takoba's hilt, like many iron implements, is fully covered. Typically the simple but deep crossguard is of iron sheet, or iron-framed wood, covered in tooled leather, and occasionally sheathed in brass or silver; the grip is also often leather-covered but the pommel is always of metal, often brass or copper, sometimes iron or silver.

From an initial one-cell model, Bell advanced to a 3,393-cell "Cygnet" model in 1907. This 40-foot-long (12.2 m), 200-pound (91 kilogram) kite was towed by a steamer offshore near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, on December 6, 1907, and carried a man 168 feet (51.2 metres) above the water. Bell also experimented with a large circular "tetrahedral truss" design during the same period. The tetrahedral kite is stable and easy to fly, but is not a light-wind kite. The large number of structural spars makes it relatively heavy and it requires moderate to strong winds.

Kites of related design are used for sailing, including speed sailing. Jacob's Ladder, a kite-powered boat, set the C-Class world sailing speed record with a speed of 25 kn in 1982, a record that stood for six years. A kiteboard was the first sailing craft to exceed a speed of 50 kn in October 2008. Power kites range in size from 1.2 to 50 m2.

["The Earth's hemispheres experience summer and winter due to the planet's tilted axis. During the summer months, the hemisphere tilted towards the sun receives more direct sunlight, causing warmer temperatures and longer days. This is known as the Northern Hemisphere's summer, which occurs between June and August in the Northern Hemisphere and December to February in the Southern Hemisphere. Conversely, during the winter months, the opposite hemisphere receives less direct sunlight, resulting in colder temperatures and shorter days. This is known as the Northern Hemisphere's winter, which occurs between December and February in the Northern Hemisphere and June to August in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn terms of the question, the answer is D. The Earth's hemispheres experience summer and winter due to the planet's tilted axis, which causes the hemispheres to spin counter clockwise on Earth's axis. This tilt causes the hemispheres to receive more or less direct sunlight, resulting in the seasonal changes.\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere's summer occurs between June and August, while the Southern Hemisphere's summer occurs between December and February. During these months, the hemispheres tilted towards the sun receive more direct sunlight, causing warmer temperatures and longer days.

  Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring

  North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun. Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the March and September equinoxes, when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

  once every sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds), whether visible at night or obscured in daylight. Unlike the stars, the Sun and Moon do not have a fixed declination. Since Earth's rotational axis is tilted about 23.5° with respect to a line perpendicular to its orbital plane (the ecliptic), the Sun's declination ranges from +23.5° on the June solstice to −23.5° on the December solstice, as Earth orbits the Sun once every tropical year. Therefore in June, in the Northern Hemisphere, the midday Sun is higher in the sky, and daytime then is longer than in December. In the Southern Hemisphere, the

  On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time. Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter. Places north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year. Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times. The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the axial tilt of Earth. The imaginary line around which Earth spins, which goes between

  The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of Earth, which is not possible if Earth is a single-sided disk, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell). The North Pole is in continuous night for six months of the year. The same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible while it is dark, making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star Polaris (the "North Star") is almost directly overhead and therefore at the center of this rotation.

   The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In

  2.9 days longer than autumn due to the Milankovitch cycles. Apsidal precession also slowly changes the place in Earth's orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur. This is a slow change in the orbit of Earth, not the axis of rotation, which is referred to as axial precession. Over the next 10,000 years, the northern hemisphere winters will become gradually longer and summers will become shorter. However, any cooling effect in one hemisphere is balanced by warming in the other, and any overall change will be counteracted by the fact that the eccentricity of Earth's orbit will be almost halved. This will reduce the mean orbital radius and raise temperatures in both hemispheres closer to the mid-interglacial peak.

  The length of the day varies because as Earth rotates, some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle. In locations just outside the polar circles, there are so-called "white nights" in the middle of summer, in which the sun is never more than a few degrees below the horizon in June such that a bright twilight persists from sunset to sunrise. In Russia, Saint Petersburg uses this phenomenon in its tourist marketing.

  Compared to axial tilt, other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes. The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the Sun because of its elliptical orbit. In fact, Earth reaches perihelion (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches aphelion (the point farthest from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of orbital eccentricity opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received. Orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun. This is because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern, and land warms more readily than sea. Any noticeable intensification of southern winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere.

["The skin is the largest organ in the human body, and it serves as a protective barrier against external factors. It is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is the outermost layer and is responsible for protecting the body from physical and chemical damage. It is composed of several layers, including the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer and provides a waterproof barrier. The dermis, or middle layer, is composed of connective tissue and provides support and elasticity to the skin. It also contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerve endings. The subcutaneous tissue, or innermost layer, is composed of fat and connective tissue and provides insulation and cushioning.\n\nThe skin also plays a crucial role in protecting the body from pathogens. The skin's acidic pH, which is around 5.5, creates an unfavorable environment for many bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the skin's natural defense mechanisms, such as the production of antimicrobial peptides and the presence of immune cells, help to prevent infections.\n\nIn terms of skin protection, Eucerin pH5 range is a term that refers to a line of skincare products that have a pH level of around 5.5. This pH level is similar to that of", 'Which term is involved with protection by skin?Which term is involved with protection by skin?\nA. Eucerin pH5 range\nB.

  Although the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose. The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. harmful substances and microorganisms) and to contain all body fluids. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis. For transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the two sublayers of the epidermis to reach the microcirculation of the dermis. The Stratum corneum is the top layer of the skin and varies in thickness from approximately ten to several hundred micrometres, depending on the region of the body. It is composed of layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes surrounded by a lipid matrix, which together act as

  brick-and-mortar system that is difficult to penetrate. The stratum corneum provides the most significant barrier to diffusion. In fact, the stratum corneum is the barrier to approximately 90% of transdermal drug applications. However, nearly all molecules penetrate it to some minimal degree. Below the stratum corneum lies the viable epidermis. This layer is about ten times as thick as the stratum corneum; however, diffusion is much faster here due to the greater degree of hydration in the living cells of the viable epidermis. Below the epidermis lies the dermis, which is approximately one millimeter thick, 100 times the thickness of the stratum corneum. The dermis contains small vessels that distribute drugs into the systemic circulation and to regulate temperature, a system known as the skin's microcirculation.

  A person's complexion is a biological trait. The family of biological pigments known as melanin is mainly responsible for variation in tone. Melanocytes insert granules of melanin called melanosomes into the other skin cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cellular nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the sun's ionizing radiation. The human body tends to protect itself against harmful surroundings. The epidermis of the body, very sensitive and delicate, reacts almost immediately to most outside effects. People whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the Equator generally have more active melanocytes,

 The skin is composed of three main layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis. The outermost layer is called the epidermis and serves as a protective barrier against the environment. It is a stratified squamous epithelium mainly made up of keratinocytes, which make up about 95% of the epidermal cells. Other cells found in the epidermis include melanocytes, Merkel cells, and Langerhans cells. The epidermis can be further divided into five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis and consists of multiple layers of flattened and cornified cells called corneocytes. This layer provides protection against water loss and physical damage. The stratum lucidum is a translucent layer found only in thick skin areas, such as the palms and soles. The stratum granulosum is responsible for the production of lipids that contribute to the barrier function of the skin. The stratum spinosum contains keratinocytes that are actively dividing, while the stratum basale is the deepest layer where new skin cells are constantly produced.

Beneath the epidermis lies the dermis, a layer composed of connective tissue. It contains various structures such as blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The dermis provides support, nourishment, and elasticity to the skin. It is rich in collagen and elastin fibers, which give the skin its strength and flexibility.

The deepest layer of the skin is called the hypodermis, or subcutaneous tissue. It is mainly composed of adipose (fat) cells and serves as insulation, cushioning, and energy storage. The hypodermis also connects the skin to underlying muscles and tissues.

Each layer of the skin has its own specific functions, working together to protect the body and maintain its integrity.

 The integumentary system is the set of organs forming the outermost layer of an animal's body. It comprises the skin and its appendages, acting as a physical barrier between the external environment and the internal environment that it serves to protect and maintain.

The integumentary system includes hair, scales, feathers, hooves, and nails. It has a variety of additional functions; it may serve to maintain water balance, protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate body temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory receptors to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature.

Structure

Skin 

The skin is one of the largest organs of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5-2m2 of surface area.

The skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina and reticular lamina). The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.

Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.

Epidermis

The epidermis is the strong, superficial layer that serves as the first line of protection against the outer environment. The human epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum, called the stratum lucidum. The epidermis is regenerated from the stem cells found in the basal layer that develop into the corneum. The epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis.

Its main functions are protection, absorption of nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium; four types of cells: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Merkel cells, and Langerhans cells.

The predominant cell type of the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection, and is responsible for the formation of the epidermal water barrier by making and secreting lipids.  The majority of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to "stay" atop the structure.

The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from a thin area called the nail matrix at an average of 1 mm per week. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as it mixes with matrix cells. Only primates have nails. In other vertebrates, the keratinizing system at the terminus of each digit produces claws or hooves.

The epidermis of vertebrates is surrounded by two kinds of coverings, which are produced by the epidermis itself. In fish and aquatic amphibians, it is a thin mucus layer that is constantly being replaced. In terrestrial vertebrates, it is the stratum corneum (dead keratinized cells). The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis, where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands, transport their products.

Dermis

The dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and areolar connective tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern.

The dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The papillary layer is the superficial layer that forms finger-like projections into the epidermis (dermal papillae), and consists of highly vascularized, loose connective tissue. The reticular layer is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging. The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many chromatophores are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.

Hypodermis

The hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes, which are specialized in accumulating and storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.

The hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.

Functions
The integumentary system has multiple roles in maintaining the body's equilibrium. All body systems work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body.  The skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body's first line of defense against infection, temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis.

Its main functions include:

Protect the body's internal living tissues and organs
Protect against invasion by infectious organisms
Protect the body from dehydration
Protect the body against abrupt changes in temperature, maintain homeostasis
Help excrete waste materials through perspiration
Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see Somatosensory system)
Protect the body against sunburns by secreting melanin
Generate vitamin D through exposure to ultraviolet light
Store water, fat, glucose, vitamin D
Maintenance of the body form
Formation of new cells from stratum germinativum to repair minor injuries
Protect from UV rays.
Regulates body temperature
It distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings.

Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is called integumentary exchange.

Clinical significance

Possible diseases and injuries to the human integumentary system include:

 Rash
 Yeast
 Athlete's foot
 Infection
 Sunburn
 Skin cancer
 Albinism
 Acne
 Herpes
 Herpes labialis, commonly called cold sores
 Impetigo
 Rubella
 Cancer
 Psoriasis
 Rabies

 The skin is composed of three main layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.

The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and serves as a protective barrier against external factors. It consists of five layers, including the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum germinativum. The stratum corneum and stratum lucidum are found in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, providing additional protection in these areas.

Beneath the epidermis lies the dermis, which is responsible for providing support and elasticity to the skin. It is composed of two parts: the dermal papillary layer and the dermal reticular layer. The dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, sweat glands, and nerves. Specialized proteins, such as collagen and elastin, are highly concentrated in the dermis and are responsible for maintaining the skin's structure and elasticity.

The deepest layer of the skin is called the hypodermis, also known as the subcutaneous layer. It is primarily made up of fat cells (adipocytes) and connective tissue, serving as an energy reservoir, insulation, and cushioning for the body.

Each layer of the skin plays a significant role in maintaining skin health and function. The epidermis acts as a protective barrier, the dermis provides support and elasticity, and the hypodermis offers insulation and cushioning.

 The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and is responsible for protecting the body. It is made up of two portions: the outer dead cornified portion, which acts as a barrier, and the deeper living portion that folds into the dermis. The epidermis is nourished by blood vessels in the dermis and undergoes constant renewal with new cells every 30 days. 

Within the epidermis, there are two types of cells: melanocytes and keratinocytes. Melanocytes are located in the deep basal layer of the epidermis and produce melanin, a pigment that gives color to the skin and hair while also protecting against the damaging effects of UV sunlight. The amount of melanin produced determines the range of skin and hair colors, with more melanin resulting in darker skin color.

Keratinocytes make up the majority of epidermal cells and are responsible for producing keratin, a tough protein that helps form a protective layer on the skin's surface. They play a vital role in maintaining the skin's barrier function and preventing dehydration.

The dermis is the second layer of the skin and contains a highly vascular connective tissue framework. It provides structural support and elasticity to the skin. Within the dermis, there are various structures such as sweat glands (including eccrine and apocrine sweat glands), sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. The dermis also houses nerve endings and blood vessels, allowing it to serve important sensory and thermoregulatory functions.

Finally, the subcutaneous tissue, also known as the hypodermis, is primarily composed of fat and loose connective tissue. It serves as a cushioning layer, providing insulation and storing energy.

Together, these layers of the skin work in harmony to protect the body from external factors, regulate body temperature, and provide sensory feedback.

  therefore larger quantities of melanin in their skins. This makes their skins very dark and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun (it also depends on the country). In areas of the globe closer to the poles, people have far less need for protection from ionizing radiation, so their skin is usually lighter. A study published in the Journal of Human Evolution proposes that people in the Tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect their body's folate reserves. Those living away from the equator have developed a fair skin to absorb enough sunlight to maintain adequate vitamin D in their bodies.

  Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.

The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. harmful substances and microorganisms) and to contain all body fluids. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis. For transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the two sublayers of the epidermis to reach the microcirculation of the dermis.

The integumentary system includes hair, scales, feathers, hooves, and nails. It has a variety of additional functions; it may serve to maintain water balance, protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate body temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory receptors to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature.

Structure

Skin 

The skin is one of the largest organs of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5-2m2 of surface area.

The skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina and reticular lamina). The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.

Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.

Epidermis

The epidermis is the strong, superficial layer that serves as the first line of protection against the outer environment. The human epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum, called the stratum lucidum. The epidermis is regenerated from the stem cells found in the basal layer that develop into the corneum. The epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis.

The majority of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to "stay" atop the structure.

The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from a thin area called the nail matrix at an average of 1 mm per week. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as it mixes with matrix cells. Only primates have nails. In other vertebrates, the keratinizing system at the terminus of each digit produces claws or hooves.

The epidermis of vertebrates is surrounded by two kinds of coverings, which are produced by the epidermis itself. In fish and aquatic amphibians, it is a thin mucus layer that is constantly being replaced. In terrestrial vertebrates, it is the stratum corneum (dead keratinized cells). The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis, where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands, transport their products.

The dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and areolar connective tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern.

The dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The papillary layer is the superficial layer that forms finger-like projections into the epidermis (dermal papillae), and consists of highly vascularized, loose connective tissue. The reticular layer is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging. The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many chromatophores are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.

The hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes, which are specialized in accumulating and storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.

The hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.

Functions
The integumentary system has multiple roles in maintaining the body's equilibrium. All body systems work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body.  The skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body's first line of defense against infection, temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis.

Its main functions include:

Protect the body's internal living tissues and organs
Protect against invasion by infectious organisms
Protect the body from dehydration
Protect the body against abrupt changes in temperature, maintain homeostasis
Help excrete waste materials through perspiration
Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see Somatosensory system)
Protect the body against sunburns by secreting melanin
Generate vitamin D through exposure to ultraviolet light
Store water, fat, glucose, vitamin D
Maintenance of the body form
Formation of new cells from stratum germinativum to repair minor injuries
Protect from UV rays.
Regulates body temperature
It distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings.

Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is called integumentary exchange.

Clinical significance

 Rash
 Yeast
 Athlete's foot
 Infection
 Sunburn
 Skin cancer
 Albinism
 Acne
 Herpes
 Herpes labialis, commonly called cold sores

The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and is responsible for protecting the body. It is made up of two portions: the outer dead cornified portion, which acts as a barrier, and the deeper living portion that folds into the dermis. The epidermis is nourished by blood vessels in the dermis and undergoes constant renewal with new cells every 30 days. Within the epidermis, there are two types of cells: melanocytes and keratinocytes. They play a vital role in maintaining the skin's barrier function and preventing dehydration. Within the dermis, there are various structures such as sweat glands (including eccrine and apocrine sweat glands), sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. The dermis also houses nerve endings and blood vessels, allowing it to serve important sensory and thermoregulatory functions. Finally, the subcutaneous tissue, also known as the hypodermis, is primarily composed of fat and loose connective tissue. Together, these layers of the skin work in harmony to protect the body from external factors, regulate body temperature, and provide sensory feedback. It comprises the skin and its appendages, acting as a physical barrier between the external environment and the internal environment that it serves to protect and maintain. The integumentary system includes hair, scales, feathers, hooves, and nails. The skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue. Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Epidermis

The epidermis is the strong, superficial layer that serves as the first line of protection against the outer environment. The human epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum, called the stratum lucidum. The epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis. The predominant cell type of the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection, and is responsible for the formation of the epidermal water barrier by making and secreting lipids. The majority of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis, where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands, transport their products. Dermis

The dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. The dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers.

The skin is composed of three main layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and serves as a protective barrier against external factors. The dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, sweat glands, and nerves. Specialized proteins, such as collagen and elastin, are highly concentrated in the dermis and are responsible for maintaining the skin's structure and elasticity. It is primarily made up of fat cells (adipocytes) and connective tissue, serving as an energy reservoir, insulation, and cushioning for the body. The epidermis acts as a protective barrier, the dermis provides support and elasticity, and the hypodermis offers insulation and cushioning. The outermost layer is called the epidermis and serves as a protective barrier against the environment. It is a stratified squamous epithelium mainly made up of keratinocytes, which make up about 95% of the epidermal cells. The epidermis can be further divided into five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. It contains various structures such as blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The dermis provides support, nourishment, and elasticity to the skin.

  When Sony released the first Walkmans, they featured two headphone jacks and a "hotline" switch. When pressed, this button activated a microphone and lowered the volume to enable those listening to have a conversation without removing their headphones. Sony Chairman Akio Morita added these features to the design for fear the technology would be isolating. Although Morita "thought it would be considered rude for one person to be listening to his music in isolation", people bought their own units rather than share and these features were removed for later models.

  The Walkman effect refers to the way music listened to via headphones allows the user to gain more control over their environment. It was coined by International Research Center for Japanese Studies Professor Shuhei Hosokawa in an article of the same name published in Popular Music in 1984. While the term was named after the dominant portable music technology of the time, the Sony Walkman, it generically applies to all such devices and has been cited numerous times to refer to more current products such as the Apple iPod.

  The Walkman S Series is a series of portable media players, designed and developed by Sony, with an accent on the high quality sound. The first models made their debut in Japan in the fall of 2006 and later were launched in North America, Europe and the rest of Asia. Although the first generation of models had generic displays, all next generations of players of the S Series, starting with S510/S610/S710 lines, had TFT color displays and supported high quality video playback. Noise cancelling function was introduced with S700 series and consolidated in later generation models, such as NWZ-S718 that came out in 2007, NWZ-S739F from 2008, NW-S746

In 1979, the Walkman was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players and in 1982, Sony launched the world's first Compact Disc player, the Sony CDP-101, with a Compact Disc (CD) itself, a new data storage format Sony and Philips co-developed. In that year, a 3.5-inch floppy disk structure was introduced by Sony and it soon became the defacto standard. In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products. Under the vision of Morita, the company aggressively expanded into new businesses.

  The initial Walkman marketing campaign showcased the freedom it brought. The first presentation to the press involved young people riding bikes and skateboarding while listening to Walkmans. Hosokawa points to this ability to listen to music and do something else as making those experiences more pleasurable. The Walkman, he says, is the "autonomy-of-the-walking-self." Sony's vice president in charge of audio products said that Walkman's achievement was that it "provided listeners with a personal soundtrack to their lives", allowing its users "to make even the most boring daily activities interesting, adding a bit of personal style to everything they do."

 In many ways, technology has improved our standard of living. We have more access to information than ever before, with instant updates on our personal electronic devices. Technology has improved emergency response time, gotten better at predicting inclement weather, and has provided new forms of treatment in medical care.
When it comes to hearing health, there have been significant technological strides. Hearing aids now provide wearers with instant access to audio through their smartphones, streaming phone conversations, music, and other media directly to the hearing aids. Their small size and super-fast sound processing platforms ensure that people with hearing loss now hear better than ever before. Certain hearing aids have also been found to outperform normal hearing in challenging noise situations!
Even so, advancements in technology are a double-edged sword. The dependency and efficiency of today’s electronics could potentially harm our hearing, if left unchecked. Moreover, some studies have posited that modern life is louder than ever before. The main concern is the on-going exposure to loud noises, which could harm your hearing and lead to noise-induced hearing loss.
Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common forms of hearing loss, along with presbycusis (age-related). It is a form of sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in the inner ear, due to the irreparable damage of inner ear hair cells. Inner ear hair cells receive vibrations of sound waves from the middle ear and translate them into neural signals sent to the brain to be processed as sound. This form of hearing loss may be caused by certain antibiotic medications, presbycusis, or trauma to the head and neck area, to name a few.
Another cause of sensorineural hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds. All sounds can be measured in decibels. A regular conversation, sitting face to face with someone, usually clocks in around 60 decibels. Sounds that could harm our hearing – after just one hour of exposure – tend to be above 85 decibels. At 120 decibels, we may be at risk for immediate, permanent hearing damage.
With more reliable rechargeable batteries, our electronics these days last longer than devices such as the Walkman, which required constant battery changes. Advancements in technology mean we have access to clearer, richer sound than ever before. This makes watching film or video, or listening music, far more enjoyable than the days when images were blurry or sounds were muddled and scratchy.
Moreover, there is so much more at our disposal these days. In a single hour of surfing the internet, we could run through videos on YouTube, a TV show on Netflix, and have a video chat with a friend. We don’t even have to sit at home to do this! We can access these various forms of media virtually anywhere we go, thanks to 3G and WiFi. And usually, we’re accessing the audio with the use of convenient earbuds.
Portable audio devices are ubiquitous now, and earbuds are convenient and portable. In previous generations, headphones were usually worn over the ear, which is significantly less dangerous to hearing than earbuds.
Coupled with long-lasting battery life of personal electronic devices, such as a smartphone, iPod, or tablet, it is not uncommon for people to be plugged in for many hours at a time, with earbuds, playing music and media at high-risk volumes. Though some devices offer volume control or alerts to let you know that you are approaching dangerously loud levels, they are easily ignored.
Earbuds play sounds 7 to 9 decibels higher than over-the-ear headphones, and since they are not effective at blocking out extraneous noise, earbud wearers tend to turn them up louder in order to drown out competing sounds. The proximity of the earbud to the eardrum can lead to serious damage.
Reducing the amount of damaging noises in your daily life will help to prevent hearing loss in the long term. Using noise-canceling headphones is the healthiest option for your hearing, as they cancel out external noise and do not require you to crank up the volume in order to hear. While listening to music or media on your personal electronic devices, be sure to wear noise-canceling over-the-ear headphones, rather than earbuds, and follow the 60-60 rule: 60% volume for no more than 60 minutes at a time. Make sure to give your ears a chance to rest!

  Cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications, home audio systems, and for mobile use in cars, as well as portable recorders. From the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the cassette deck was the preferred music source for the automobile. Like an 8-track cartridge, it was relatively insensitive to vehicle motion, but it had reduced tape flutter, as well as the obvious advantages of smaller physical size and fast forward/rewind capability. A major boost to the cassette's popularity came with the release of the Sony Walkman "personal" cassette player in 1979, designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact "wearable" music source. Although the vast majority of such players eventually sold were not Sony products, the name "Walkman" has become synonymous with this type of device. Cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio, and many in professional audio, with each company offering models of very high quality.

The first model with built-in speakers was NWZ-S543/B, that had a capacity of 4 GB. It had a 2.4" LCD screen with a resolution of 320 X 240 pixels. The 8 GB model NWZ-S764/B was launched in 2011. Although it had a smaller screen of 2", it had Bluetooth connectivity and a greater battery life. Bluetooth connectivity remained present in the next two generations of players (S770 and S780 series). A previous S Series of the Walkman consisting of small players existed in 2003.

  Music for Stowaways was inspired by the band's love for the then-new Sony Walkman, at the time called the Sony Stowaway in the United Kingdom, and was intended to be played on the device. The group's concept behind the album, described by Ware as the album's "theory," was based on part of their fascination with the Stowaway, as they found that the device allowed owners to "design a soundtrack for your everyday life for the first time and have it playing while you walked around or whatever." Ware later explained: "[That] became the theory behind [Music for Stowaways]. It was about how you could play your music and change your mood wherever you were. Basically, the Walkman liberated music. And there we were at the sharp end with this cassette-only

  The chorus and echo are tied together, both being on when the switch was set to normal. Either chorus or echo can be disabled, but not both at the same time. The output was then processed by an integrated amp simulator to the headphone jack and low level output jack. The 'Rockman' name has similarity to Sony's 'Walkman' which had been introduced to the US in 1980 as a breakthrough in portable stereophonic electronics. The Rockman even allowed you to plug your Walkman in using its AUX INPUT jack which allowed you to play along with your cassette tapes for a 100% stereo experience.

When pressed, this button activated a microphone and lowered the volume to enable those listening to have a conversation without removing their headphones. Sony Chairman Akio Morita added these features to the design for fear the technology would be isolating. Although Morita "thought it would be considered rude for one person to be listening to his music in isolation", people bought their own units rather than share and these features were removed for later models.

The first presentation to the press involved young people riding bikes and skateboarding while listening to Walkmans. Hosokawa points to this ability to listen to music and do something else as making those experiences more pleasurable. The Walkman, he says, is the "autonomy-of-the-walking-self." Sony's vice president in charge of audio products said that Walkman's achievement was that it "provided listeners with a personal soundtrack to their lives", allowing its users "to make even the most boring daily activities interesting, adding a bit of personal style to everything they do."

It was coined by International Research Center for Japanese Studies Professor Shuhei Hosokawa in an article of the same name published in Popular Music in 1984. While the term was named after the dominant portable music technology of the time, the Sony Walkman, it generically applies to all such devices and has been cited numerous times to refer to more current products such as the Apple iPod.

The group's concept behind the album, described by Ware as the album's "theory," was based on part of their fascination with the Stowaway, as they found that the device allowed owners to "design a soundtrack for your everyday life for the first time and have it playing while you walked around or whatever." Ware later explained: "[That] became the theory behind [Music for Stowaways]. It was about how you could play your music and change your mood wherever you were.

In that year, a 3.5-inch floppy disk structure was introduced by Sony and it soon became the defacto standard. In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products. Under the vision of Morita, the company aggressively expanded into new businesses.

  Because 8Li and 12Be form natural stopping points on the table of isotopes for hydrogen fusion, it is believed that all of the higher elements are formed in very hot stars where higher orders of fusion predominate. A star like the Sun produces energy by the fusion of simple 1H into 4He through a series of reactions. It is believed that when the inner core exhausts its 1H fuel, the Sun will contract, slightly increasing its core temperature until 4He can fuse and become the main fuel supply. Pure 4He fusion leads to 8Be, which decays back to 2 4He; therefore the 4He must fuse with isotopes either more or less massive than itself to result in an energy producing reaction. When 4He fuses with 2H or 3H, it forms stable isotopes 6Li and 7Li respectively. The higher order isotopes between 8Li and 12C are synthesized by similar reactions between hydrogen, helium, and lithium isotopes.

Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona. At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement

   All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate. The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.

  Implosion is a key part of the gravitational collapse of large stars, which can lead to the creation of supernovae, neutron stars and black holes. In the most common case, the innermost part of a large star (called the core) stops burning and without this source of heat, the forces holding electrons and protons apart are no longer strong enough to do so. The core collapses in on itself exceedingly quickly, and becomes a neutron star or black hole; the outer layers of the original star fall inwards and may rebound off the newly created neutron star (if one was created), creating a supernova.

  German physicist Hans Bethe explains how stars generate energy. He outlines a series of nuclear fusion reactions that turn hydrogen into helium and release enormous amounts of energy in a star's core. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years.

  it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements. The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming

  In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

This decreases the material's volume and thus increases its density by a factor of two to three, causing it to reach critical mass and create a nuclear explosion. In some forms of thermonuclear weapons, the energy from this explosion is then used to implode a capsule of fusion fuel before igniting it, causing a fusion reaction (see Teller–Ulam design).

["Rabbits are known for their long ears, which help them to hear predators and locate food. The length of a rabbit's ears is determined by genetics, specifically the presence of a dominant allele for long ears. This allele is passed down from parents to offspring, and if both parents have long ears, their offspring will also have long ears. The length of the ears is not affected by the amount of food available or the presence of predators.\n\nIn a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis, they found that the length of a rabbit's ears is determined by a single gene. The gene, called Fgf20, is responsible for the development of the ear cartilage. The researchers found that rabbits with long ears had a different version of the Fgf20 gene than rabbits with short ears.\n\nThe study also found that the length of a rabbit's ears is not affected by environmental factors. The researchers raised rabbits in both controlled and natural environments, and found that the length of their ears was the same in both cases.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of a rabbit's ears is determined by genetics, specifically the presence of a dominant allele for long ears. This allele is passed down from parents to offspring, and if both parents have long ears, their offspring will also have long ears. The length of the ears is", 'Through DNA, a rabbit will have long ears ifThrough DNA, a rabbit will have long ears if\nA. rabbits are born with ears\nB. there was a lot of food\nC. genetic contributors had long ears\nD. parents were also rabbits']

  This species weighs from 2.9 to 7.2 kg, averaging 4.8 kg, and it is thus one of the largest lagomorphs, alongside the similarly sized brown hare and Arctic hare. The Alaskan hare's ears are fairly short compared to most. They have evolved shorter ears than most hares in order to conserve heat throughout the winter months. Hare's ears play an important role in thermoregulation, and with the Alaskan hare's ears being small, it prevents heat loss in cold climates. In the summer, Alaskan hares have a brown fur coat with white under parts. In the winter, they have a white fur coat with black-tipped ears. They

   Longer (or thicker) ears are more likely to droop. Some lop-eared rabbits have been deliberately bred for exaggerated ear length. As this can be considered detrimental to the rabbit's health, requirements in Germany "ban rabbits with ears over 25.5 in, and in Holland, 27.5 in is as long as they can be allowed [in shows] before disqualification." The Guinness World Records award for "Longest ears on a rabbit" was given in 2003 to an English Lop in the United States with ears measuring 31.125 in.

 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder whose primary feature is dwarfism. In those with the condition, the arms and legs are short, while the torso is typically of normal length. Those affected have an average adult height of  for males and  for females. Other features can include an enlarged head and prominent forehead. Complications can include sleep apnea or recurrent ear infections. The disorder does not generally affect intelligence.

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in its protein being overactive. The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing.

Treatments may include support groups and growth hormone therapy. Efforts to treat or prevent complications such as obesity, hydrocephalus, obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear infections or spinal stenosis may be required. Life expectancy of those affected is about 10 years less than average. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and affects about 1 in 27,500 people.

Signs and symptoms
 Disproportionate dwarfism 
 Shortening of the proximal limbs (called rhizomelic shortening)
 Short fingers and toes with trident hands
 Large head with prominent forehead frontal bossing
 Small midface with a flattened nasal bridge
 Spinal kyphosis (convex curvature) or lordosis (concave curvature)
 Varus (bowleg) or valgus (knock knee) deformities
 Frequent ear infections (due to Eustachian tube blockages), sleep apnea (which can be central or obstructive), and hydrocephalus

Complications

Children 
Children with achondroplasia often have less muscle tone; because of this it is common for them to have delayed walking and motor skills. It is also common for children to have bowed legs, scoliosis, lordosis, arthritis, issues with joint flexibility, breathing problems, ear infections, and crowded teeth. These issues can be treated with surgery, braces, or physical therapy.

Hydrocephalus is a severe effect associated with achondroplasia in children. This condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid is not able to flow in and out of the skull because of how the spine narrows. This fluid build up is associated with an enlarged head, vomiting, lethargy, headaches, and irritability. A shunt surgery is commonly performed to treat this condition, but an endoscopic third ventriculostomy can also be done.

Adults 
Adults with achondroplasia often face issues with obesity and sleep apnea. It is also typical for adults to suffer from numbness or tingling in their legs because of nerve compression.

Pregnancy in women with achondroplasia is considered higher risk. Women with achondroplasia generally have their babies delivered through C-sections to prevent complications that could occur with a natural birth.

Causes

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This gene is mainly responsible for making the protein, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein contributes to the production of collagen and other structural components in tissues and bones. When the FGFR3 gene is mutated it interferes with how this protein interacts with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. Cartilage is not able to fully develop into bone, causing the individual to be disproportionately shorter in height.

In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). This occurs due to respiratory failure from an underdeveloped ribcage. A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.

Achondroplasia can be inherited through autosomal dominance. In couples where one partner has achondroplasia there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder onto their child every pregnancy. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to severe or lethal bone dysplasia.

Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3. The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increase in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation. The occurrence rate of achondroplasia in the children of fathers over 50 years of age is 1 in 1,875, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.
Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35.

There are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.

Diagnosis

Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-face hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.

Radiologic findings
A skeletal survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often "double jointed". The diagnosis can be made by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the short femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.

Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy.

Treatment
There is no known cure for achondroplasia even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involve a different hormonal pathway. Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy. After the second year of growth hormone therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases, so the therapy is not a satisfactory long-term treatment.

An experimental drug called vosoritide has shown promise in stage 3 human trials, although its long-term effects are unknown.

The controversial surgery of limb-lengthening will increase the length of the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia.

Epidemiology
Achondroplasia is one of several congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.

Research
, tentative evidence has found that the experimental peptide drug vosoritide increases growth velocity in those with achondroplasia. The drug inhibits the activity of FGFR3.

Animals 
Based on their disproportionate dwarfism, some dog breeds traditionally have been classified as "achondroplastic". This is the case for the dachshund, basset hound, corgi and bulldog breeds. Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting achondroplasia.

A similar form of achondroplasia was found in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. This involved a mutation of the protein collagen, type X, alpha 1, encoded by the COL10A1 gene.  In humans a similar mutation (G595E) has been associated with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a relatively mild skeletal disorder that is also associated with dwarfism.

The now-extinct Ancon sheep was created by humans through the selective breeding of common domestic sheep with achondroplasia. The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by achondroplasia was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.

Another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.

Research
, tentative evidence has found that the experimental peptide drug vosoritide increases growth velocity in those with achondroplasia. The drug inhibits the activity of FGFR3.

Animals 
Based on their disproportionate dwarfism, some dog breeds traditionally have been classified as "achondroplastic". This is the case for the dachshund, basset hound, corgi and bulldog breeds. Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting achondroplasia.

A similar form of achondroplasia was found in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. This involved a mutation of the protein collagen, type X, alpha 1, encoded by the COL10A1 gene.  In humans a similar mutation (G595E) has been associated with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a relatively mild skeletal disorder that is also associated with dwarfism.

The now-extinct Ancon sheep was created by humans through the selective breeding of common domestic sheep with achondroplasia. The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by achondroplasia was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.

 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder whose primary feature is dwarfism. In those with the condition, the arms and legs are short, while the torso is typically of normal length. Those affected have an average adult height of  for males and  for females. Other features can include an enlarged head and prominent forehead. Complications can include sleep apnea or recurrent ear infections. The disorder does not generally affect intelligence.

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in its protein being overactive. The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing.

Treatments may include support groups and growth hormone therapy. Efforts to treat or prevent complications such as obesity, hydrocephalus, obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear infections or spinal stenosis may be required. Life expectancy of those affected is about 10 years less than average. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and affects about 1 in 27,500 people.

Signs and symptoms
 Disproportionate dwarfism 
 Shortening of the proximal limbs (called rhizomelic shortening)
 Short fingers and toes with trident hands
 Large head with prominent forehead frontal bossing
 Small midface with a flattened nasal bridge
 Spinal kyphosis (convex curvature) or lordosis (concave curvature)
 Varus (bowleg) or valgus (knock knee) deformities
 Frequent ear infections (due to Eustachian tube blockages), sleep apnea (which can be central or obstructive), and hydrocephalus

Complications

Children 
Children with achondroplasia often have less muscle tone; because of this it is common for them to have delayed walking and motor skills. It is also common for children to have bowed legs, scoliosis, lordosis, arthritis, issues with joint flexibility, breathing problems, ear infections, and crowded teeth. These issues can be treated with surgery, braces, or physical therapy.

Hydrocephalus is a severe effect associated with achondroplasia in children. This condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid is not able to flow in and out of the skull because of how the spine narrows. This fluid build up is associated with an enlarged head, vomiting, lethargy, headaches, and irritability. A shunt surgery is commonly performed to treat this condition, but an endoscopic third ventriculostomy can also be done.

Adults 
Adults with achondroplasia often face issues with obesity and sleep apnea. It is also typical for adults to suffer from numbness or tingling in their legs because of nerve compression.

Pregnancy in women with achondroplasia is considered higher risk. Women with achondroplasia generally have their babies delivered through C-sections to prevent complications that could occur with a natural birth.

Causes

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This gene is mainly responsible for making the protein, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein contributes to the production of collagen and other structural components in tissues and bones. When the FGFR3 gene is mutated it interferes with how this protein interacts with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. Cartilage is not able to fully develop into bone, causing the individual to be disproportionately shorter in height.

In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). This occurs due to respiratory failure from an underdeveloped ribcage. A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.

Achondroplasia can be inherited through autosomal dominance. In couples where one partner has achondroplasia there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder onto their child every pregnancy. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to severe or lethal bone dysplasia.

Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3. The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increase in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation. The occurrence rate of achondroplasia in the children of fathers over 50 years of age is 1 in 1,875, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.
Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35.

There are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.

Diagnosis

Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-face hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.

Radiologic findings
A skeletal survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often "double jointed". The diagnosis can be made by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the short femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.

Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy.

Treatment
There is no known cure for achondroplasia even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involve a different hormonal pathway. Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy. After the second year of growth hormone therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases, so the therapy is not a satisfactory long-term treatment.

An experimental drug called vosoritide has shown promise in stage 3 human trials, although its long-term effects are unknown.

The controversial surgery of limb-lengthening will increase the length of the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia.

Epidemiology
Achondroplasia is one of several congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.

  The mountain cottontail is a small rabbit but its size is relatively large for the genus. Hind legs are long; the feet are densely covered with long hair. Ears are relatively short and rounded at the tips; the inner surfaces are noticeably haired. It has pale brown fur on the back, a distinct pale brown nape on the back of the head, black-tipped ears, a white-grey tail, and a white underside. The brown nape on the back of the head is a smaller size from than that of the Snowshoe Hare, helping to distinguish the two separate species from each other. Additionally, contrasting with the Snowshoe Hare’s long hops, the mountain cottontails take short distinctive leaps.

 Nonsyndromic deafness is hearing loss that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. In contrast, syndromic deafness involves hearing loss that occurs with abnormalities in other parts of the body. Genetic changes are related to the following types of nonsyndromic deafness.
 DFNA: nonsyndromic deafness, autosomal dominant
 DFNB: nonsyndromic deafness, autosomal recessive
 DFNX: nonsyndromic deafness, X-linked
 nonsyndromic deafness, mitochondrial

Each type is numbered in the order in which it was described. For example, DFNA1 was the first described autosomal dominant type of nonsyndromic deafness. Mitochondrial nonsyndromic deafness involves changes to the small amount of DNA found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.

Most forms of nonsyndromic deafness are associated with permanent hearing loss caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear consists of three parts: a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea that helps process sound, nerves that send information from the cochlea to the brain, and structures involved with balance. Loss of hearing caused by changes in the inner ear is called sensorineural deafness. Hearing loss that results from changes in the middle ear is called conductive hearing loss. The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic deafness involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear; this combination is called mixed hearing loss.

The severity of hearing loss varies and can change over time. It can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). Degrees of hearing loss range from mild (difficulty understanding soft speech) to profound (inability to hear even very loud noises). The loss may be stable, or it may progress as a person gets older. Particular types of nonsyndromic deafness often show distinctive patterns of hearing loss. For example, the loss may be more pronounced at high, middle, or low tones.

Classification
Nonsyndromic deafness can occur at any age. Hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak is classified as prelingual or congenital. Hearing loss that occurs after the development of speech is classified as postlingual.

Genetics
Nonsyndromic deafness can have different patterns of inheritance. Between 75% and 80% of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Usually, each parent of an individual with autosomal recessive deafness is a carrier of one copy of the altered gene. These carriers do not have hearing loss.

Another 20% to 25% of nonsyndromic deafness cases are autosomal dominant, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to result in hearing loss. People with autosomal dominant deafness most often inherit an altered copy of the gene from a parent who has hearing loss.

Between 1% and 2% of cases show an X-linked pattern of inheritance, which means the mutated gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Males with X-linked nonsyndromic deafness tend to develop more severe hearing loss earlier in life than females who inherit a copy of the same gene mutation. Fathers will not pass X-linked traits to their sons since they do not pass on the X chromosome to their male offspring.

Mitochondrial nonsyndromic deafness, which results from changes to the DNA in mitochondria, occurs in fewer than 1% of cases in the United States. The altered mitochondrial DNA is passed from a mother to her sons and daughters. This type of deafness is not inherited from fathers.

Late onset progressive deafness is the most common neurological disability of the elderly. Although hearing loss of greater than 25 decibels is present in only 1% of young adults between the ages of 18–24 years of age, this increases to 10% in persons between 55–64 years of age and approximately 50% in octogenarians.

The relative contribution of heredity to age-related hearing impairment is not known, however the majority of inherited late-onset deafness is autosomal dominant and non-syndromic (Van Camp et al., 1997). Over forty genes associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss have been localized and of these fifteen have been cloned.

Genes related to nonsyndromic deafness
Mutations in the ACTG1, CABP2, CDH23, CLDN14, COCH, COL11A2, DFNA5, ESPN, EYA4, GJB2, GJB6, KCNQ4, MYO15A, MYO6, MYO7A, OTOF, PCDH15, POU3F4, SLC26A4, STRC, TECTA, TMC1, TMIE, TMPRSS3, USH1C, and WFS1 genes cause nonsyndromic deafness, with weaker evidence currently implicating genes CCDC50, DIAPH1, DSPP, ESRRB, GJB3, GRHL2, GRXCR1, HGF, LHFPL5, LOXHD1, LRTOMT, MARVELD2, MIR96, MYH14, MYH9, MYO1A, MYO3A, OTOA, PJVK, POU4F3, PRPS1, PTPRQ, RDX, SERPINB6, SIX1, SLC17A8, TPRN, TRIOBP, SLC26A5, and WHRN.

The causes of nonsyndromic deafness can be complex.  Researchers have identified more than 30 genes that, when mutated, may cause nonsyndromic deafness; however, some of these genes have not been fully characterized.  Many genes related to deafness are involved in the development and function of the inner ear.  Gene mutations interfere with critical steps in processing sound, resulting in hearing loss.  Different mutations in the same gene can cause different types of hearing loss, and some genes are associated with both syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness.  In many families, the gene(s) involved have yet to be identified.

Deafness can also result from environmental factors or a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including certain medications, peri-natal infections (infections occurring before or after birth), and exposure to loud noise over an extended period.

Types include:

Diagnosis

Treatment
Treatment is supportive and consists of management of manifestations. User of hearing aids and/or cochlear implant, suitable educational programs can be offered. Periodic surveillance is also important.

Epidemiology
About 1 in 1,000 children in the United States is born with profound deafness. By age 9, about 3 in 1,000 children have hearing loss that affects the activities of daily living. More than half of these cases are caused by genetic factors. Most cases of genetic deafness (70% to 80%) are nonsyndromic; the remaining cases are caused by specific genetic syndromes. In adults, the chance of developing hearing loss increases with age; hearing loss affects half of all people older than 80 years.

 4 -11.01531 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder whose primary feature is dwarfism. In those with the condition, the arms and legs are short, while the torso is typically of normal length. Those affected have an average adult height of  for males and  for females. Other features can include an enlarged head and prominent forehead. Complications can include sleep apnea or recurrent ear infections. The disorder does not generally affect intelligence.

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in its protein being overactive. The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing.

Treatments may include support groups and growth hormone therapy. Efforts to treat or prevent complications such as obesity, hydrocephalus, obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear infections or spinal stenosis may be required. Life expectancy of those affected is about 10 years less than average. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and affects about 1 in 27,500 people.

 Varus (bowleg) or valgus (knock knee) deformities
 Frequent ear infections (due to Eustachian tube blockages), sleep apnea (which can be central or obstructive), and hydrocephalus

Complications

Children 
Children with achondroplasia often have less muscle tone; because of this it is common for them to have delayed walking and motor skills. It is also common for children to have bowed legs, scoliosis, lordosis, arthritis, issues with joint flexibility, breathing problems, ear infections, and crowded teeth. These issues can be treated with surgery, braces, or physical therapy.

Hydrocephalus is a severe effect associated with achondroplasia in children. This condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid is not able to flow in and out of the skull because of how the spine narrows. This fluid build up is associated with an enlarged head, vomiting, lethargy, headaches, and irritability. A shunt surgery is commonly performed to treat this condition, but an endoscopic third ventriculostomy can also be done.

Adults 
Adults with achondroplasia often face issues with obesity and sleep apnea. It is also typical for adults to suffer from numbness or tingling in their legs because of nerve compression.

Pregnancy in women with achondroplasia is considered higher risk. Women with achondroplasia generally have their babies delivered through C-sections to prevent complications that could occur with a natural birth.

Causes

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This gene is mainly responsible for making the protein, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein contributes to the production of collagen and other structural components in tissues and bones. When the FGFR3 gene is mutated it interferes with how this protein interacts with growth factors leading to complications with bone production. Cartilage is not able to fully develop into bone, causing the individual to be disproportionately shorter in height.

In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). This occurs due to respiratory failure from an underdeveloped ribcage. A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.

Achondroplasia can be inherited through autosomal dominance. In couples where one partner has achondroplasia there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder onto their child every pregnancy. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to severe or lethal bone dysplasia.

Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3. The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increase in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation. The occurrence rate of achondroplasia in the children of fathers over 50 years of age is 1 in 1,875, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population.
Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35.

There are two other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.

Diagnosis

Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-face hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.

Radiologic findings
A skeletal survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often "double jointed". The diagnosis can be made by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the short femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.

Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy.

Treatment
There is no known cure for achondroplasia even though the cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involve a different hormonal pathway. Usually, the best results appear within the first and second year of therapy. After the second year of growth hormone therapy, beneficial bone growth decreases, so the therapy is not a satisfactory long-term treatment.

An experimental drug called vosoritide has shown promise in stage 3 human trials, although its long-term effects are unknown.

The controversial surgery of limb-lengthening will increase the length of the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia.

Epidemiology
Achondroplasia is one of several congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study at the same time found a rate of 1 per 10,000.

Research
, tentative evidence has found that the experimental peptide drug vosoritide increases growth velocity in those with achondroplasia. The drug inhibits the activity of FGFR3.

Animals 
Based on their disproportionate dwarfism, some dog breeds traditionally have been classified as "achondroplastic". This is the case for the dachshund, basset hound, corgi and bulldog breeds. Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting achondroplasia.

A similar form of achondroplasia was found in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. This involved a mutation of the protein collagen, type X, alpha 1, encoded by the COL10A1 gene.  In humans a similar mutation (G595E) has been associated with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a relatively mild skeletal disorder that is also associated with dwarfism.

The now-extinct Ancon sheep was created by humans through the selective breeding of common domestic sheep with achondroplasia. The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by achondroplasia was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.

 5 -11.01531 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder whose primary feature is dwarfism. In those with the condition, the arms and legs are short, while the torso is typically of normal length. Those affected have an average adult height of  for males and  for females. Other features can include an enlarged head and prominent forehead. Complications can include sleep apnea or recurrent ear infections. The disorder does not generally affect intelligence.

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in its protein being overactive. The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing.

Treatments may include support groups and growth hormone therapy. Efforts to treat or prevent complications such as obesity, hydrocephalus, obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear infections or spinal stenosis may be required. Life expectancy of those affected is about 10 years less than average. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and affects about 1 in 27,500 people.

 the size of head-body length in pikas reaches an average of 285 mm (6- 10 inches in length), with ears around greater than 40 mm. Additionally, the Gaoligong pika has a palatal-incisive foramen that is violin-shaped. Other physical characteristics include: Most often the physical characteristics of the Pika species are compared to the family Leporidae, which includes rabbits and hares. The comparisons of the family Ochotonidae with those of the family Leporidae are due to the very similar physical characteristics shared by Pikas, rabbits and hares. However, there is a distinction between each, including size of the body and skeletal structure of each family, as well as distinctive characteristics in the length of the ears. A skeletal distinction can be seen in the Gaoligong Pika which lacks a supraorbital process in the skull skeletal feature and have a long and broad posterior nasal bone.

Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder whose primary feature is dwarfism. The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. Achondroplasia can be inherited through autosomal dominance. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to severe or lethal bone dysplasia. Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3. The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increase in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation. Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35. Diagnosis

Achondroplasia can be detected before birth by prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone does not help people with achondroplasia, which involve a different hormonal pathway. Epidemiology
Achondroplasia is one of several congenital conditions with similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and thanatophoric dysplasia. Research

 the size of head-body length in pikas reaches an average of 285 mm (6- 10 inches in length), with ears around greater than 40 mm. Additionally, the Gaoligong pika has a palatal-incisive foramen that is violin-shaped. Other physical characteristics include: Most often the physical characteristics of the Pika species are compared to the family Leporidae, which includes rabbits and hares. The comparisons of the family Ochotonidae with those of the family Leporidae are due to the very similar physical characteristics shared by Pikas, rabbits and hares. However, there is a distinction between each, including size of the body and skeletal structure of each family, as well as distinctive characteristics in the length of the ears. A skeletal distinction can be seen in the Gaoligong Pika which lacks a supraorbital process in the skull skeletal feature and have a long and broad posterior nasal bone.

  At temperatures greater than 44 C, proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down. This results in cell and tissue damage. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium. In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss, making the blood more concentrated. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers. Increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years. This is associated with increased cardiac output, metabolism, a fast heart rate, and poor immune function.

  In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns. Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%. Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire. Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam. Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns. Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30% of burns in children. Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact. Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries. This is a particular risk for adolescent males. In the United States, For non-fatal burn injuries, white males, aged <6 comprise most cases. Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.

  A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn). Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females, the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault). Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or

  Older people are more likely to suffer from heatstroke than younger people due to dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medication, and diseases involving the thermoregulatory system. If left untreated, heatstroke can fail to reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors may suffer long-term disability.

 Burn injuries are among the most horrific and excruciating one can endure. As the skin is the largest organ of the body, it possesses billions of neuron receptors—or nerves as they are commonly known—that signal feelings such as temperature or pain.
When functioning as normal, these neuron receptors on the skin send signals like “too cold” or “too hot” to the brain and the individual acts appropriately: putting on or taking off a sweater, jumping in a pool, drinking some hot coffee, and so on.
Normally, the pain response triggers a reflex as the affected area tries to avoid damage. In the event of a minor burn, or medically known as a first-degree burn injury, the outer layer of the skin, or the epidermis, is damaged. Burned individuals might treat the wound simply by pouring cold water over the hurt area. However, the damage is usually superficial and may leave little more than a minor scar.
However, in terms of more serious burn injuries, such as those caused by second-degree or third-degree burns, skin layers beneath the epidermis are affected. It is also possible that bone or organ tissues can be impacted as well, leading to serious and potentially-fatal circumstances.
Structure fires are commonly the cause of fire deaths or injuries in either a residential or office setting. Oftentimes, these fires start from faulty electrical or heating equipment, sometimes as a result of poor maintenance routines.
Most clothing is especially susceptible to fire, which can trap individuals in spreading flames. While clothing sold in the USA is meant to comply with the Flammable Fabrics Act, injuries from burning clothing are still very possible.
Automobile fires usually start as a result of an auto accident. This can include gas or engine block explosions and fires started as a result of a collision. Trapped or unconscious individuals may be especially at risk of injury.
Chemical burns are most often caused by acids or strong base chemicals. Laboratories and chemical factories are the most common places for such incidents to occur, though household chemicals can be potent enough as well.
In most chemical burns, the skin is dissolved upon contact and even vigorous washing may not rid the affected areas of dangerous chemicals, causing further damage.
Thermal burns occur most often after an individual is exposed to steam, flames, or hot surfaces or liquids. More broadly, coming into contact with anything exceeding a temperature of 115 degrees has the potential to cause a thermal burn.
Electrical burns occur when an individual is exposed to high voltage electricity. Most commonly, these injuries are work-related. Highly dangerous, electricity flows through the body in search of the easiest path of resistance towards a ground. This can cause exit wounds in addition to the initial point of contact, stop organs from functioning, and damage all surrounding tissue; any of which can cause death.
Regrow skin: The affected skin may no longer be able to regrow. Depending on the severity and location of the burn, surgeons may conduct a skin graft operation, which moves healthy skin to the affected area. Alternatively, medical advances have allowed for new treatments such as the use of artificial skin.
Retain skin elasticity: Healthy skin is highly elastic; otherwise, it would easily tear. Even minor burns can hinder or prevent the skin from retaining its elasticity.
Retain their sense of feeling: Because burns tend to destroy nerve endings in victims, the skin may lose some or all sense of feeling, including touch and temperature.
Perspire: The ability for an affected individual to perspire can also be hampered or lost. Depending on the size and location of the burn, this can prevent the body from being able to adequately regulate its temperature, making individuals far more susceptible to hyperthermia or hypothermia (dangerously high or low body temperature).
Endure hot weather: Burned skin loses its natural ability to protect the individual from sun damage and will need to be protected from the elements.
Prevent infection: Burned skin not only loses its ability to protect an individual from infection, it makes it far more likely as bacteria and other pathogens pool around dead skin. This necessitates new healthy skin to be grafted to the area else the risk of infection remains excessively high.
Burns, regardless of their point of origin, can result in shocking injuries, or even death. Medical treatment can be extensive and painful, often requiring multiple skin graft operations. Unfortunately, because there are so many different potential causes for burn injuries, there are no broad-sweeping standards for who may be liable in the event of a burn injury or fatality. Burn victims, or in the case of death, the families of burn victims, should seek legal counsel.
Kamran Yadidi Law Group’s professional team has significant experience with cases that relate to burn injuries. The firm was founded in 1996 by Kamran Yadidi, a well-known burn injury lawyer. The veteran attorneys at Kamran Yadidi Law Group have worked on over 10,000 personal injury cases, including numerous cases where clients have unfairly been subjected to burn injuries.

  High temperature steam can cause injury in humans on areas of exposed skin or by other means. Steam can cause burns through direct contact or by inhalation of vapors. Steam boilers also present an explosion hazard due to their high pressure contents. If over pressurization occurs and safety relief systems malfunction it is possible for a boiler to explode and cause damage to people and equipment surrounding it.

 Acute moist dermatitis or pyoderma: that’s the official name for your dog’s hot spots.
… And there’s more to them than you might think.
So what causes hot spots on dogs and how can you treat them naturally?
What’s Causing Your Dog’s Hot Spots?
Hot spots happen for a reason.
Hot spots can appear anywhere. You’ll usually find them in areas where your dog has a weakness or chink in her energy flow.
Energetically, hot spots are damp and bring heat and inflammation to the skin. Most hot spots are a result of too much heat in the body, blocking the movement of energy.
The allopathic view of hot spots is that they’re an acute condition.
They’re usually diagnosed as allergens or flea bites.
But hot spots on dogs can also be chronic. Most of the time they’re a symptom of a more serious condition. Chronic stress, food sensitivities, energy stagnation or liver imbalances are just a few.
Acute or chronic, hot spots need immediate attention because they spread fast. They kick out hair and become a sticky, painful, sometimes itchy mess. This can happen within hours.
If your dog’s hot spots keep coming back, muscle tension, injury and pain could be the cause. This is common if you find a hot spot on the spine. Look for tension in the area under the hot spot moving downward or slightly left or right of the area. With this type of hot spot you might see several hot spots over a short period of time. There will be excessive licking in most cases as well.
For these types of hot spots, chiropractic adjustments, acupuncture or acupressure may help. They can clear stagnant energy and bring much-needed circulation to the area.
Conventional treatment involves the suppression of a dog’s symptoms. This method of treating hot spots on dogs usually includes steroids and antibiotics.
It’s really important to try to figure out and treat what’s causing it.
Allopathic veterinary care follows the “moist skin lesion standard of care.” This starts off with chemical disinfection, steroids and sometimes antihistamines. Most owners get oral antibiotics and steroid creams to deal with the spot.
… But these treatments won’t stop the hot spots from coming back. The meds don’t treat food sensitivities or a compromised immune system.
They don’t address the underlying cause of the hot spot and can end up putting your dog into a cycle of sickness.
There is an exception to this – although the situation is quite rare. When a hot spot leads to 40% to 50% of your dog’s fur falling out, a trip to your (preferably holistic) vet is a good idea. This usually happens with immune-compromised dogs or those with severe thyroid issues.

When treating hot spots on dogs at home, to be effective you need to take a two-fold approach to treating hot spots your dog.
The first step is to treat the hot spot externally to relieve painful symptoms. You want to keep the hot spot from scabbing and avoid bacteria overgrowth.
And herbs are a great natural hot spot treatment.
After you secure your dog, gently trim the hair around the area. Then rinse with this mild rinse.
Optional: replace 4 oz of water with witch hazel or rose water for extra drying or cooling support.
Mix together the flower essence, the salt and the water. Add the Self-Heal and the echinacea.
Flush the area or gently mist and let dry. Do this 3 or 4 times for the first 24 hours.
Next, combine 1/4 cup of powdered bentonite clay with 1/8 cup of powdered echinacea, plantain leaf or yarrow. Bentonite clay is okay by itself if you don’t have access to the herbs above. Sprinkle this on the lesion and let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes. Rinse off with tepid water or the Hot Spot Rinse. Do this 2 or 3 times per day.
When the hot spot starts healing, you can use a salve made with calendula or St John’s wort oil. Both of these herbs calm the skin and remove the itch, while dispersing inflammation.
Calendula is both antibacterial and anti-fungal. It heals tissues quickly (but be careful, it can heal too quickly if an infection is present).
If the hot spot seems to be infected (with drainage or excessive scabbing) hold off. Wait until the hot spot starts healing with minimal drainage before using. You don’t want to clog it.
Some hot spots lack moisture and remain dry with limited bacteria growth. You can apply a simple calendula salve or infused oil to quickly heal tissues and calm the itch with these. For painful, dry or healing hot spots use a calendula and goldenseal spray. Add 15 drops of each tincture to one cup of water. Mist 3 to 4 times a day.
The second step in healing hot spots involves internal treatment.
A diet of fresh whole foods is better for your dog’s total health.

Support the organs of elimination like the digestive tract, kidneys and liver. This will help balance out the body and support whole body healing.
A tincture of whole burdock can clear heat out of the system and cool it from within. It will also support kidney function.
General dosage guidelines for hot spots: give 1/2 drop of tincture for each pound of body weight. Give it to your dog twice daily. If you’re using a glycerin extract use one drop for each pound of weight.
Keeping your dog’s lymphatic system moving is also an important part of healing. It removes toxins and cellular waste and transports white blood cells. An active lymphatic system decreases inflammation and helps fight off further infections.
Two herbs that work well for this are calendula and cleavers. I recommend calendula for dogs who are energetically cool to neutral. Cleavers works well for warm to hot dogs. Dogs with hot spots who have immune or organ imbalances usually fall into this category. The general dose for lymphatic support is one drop for ten pounds of bodyweight.
The skin is an organ of elimination like the colon, kidneys and liver. The suppression of symptoms should only be a last resort, saved for extreme cases.
Holistic treatments look to ease symptoms and keep hot spots from spreading. Suppressing the body’s response can drive inflammation deeper into the tissues. This eventually contributes to chronic disease.
One of the most effective ways to avoid multiple lesions is by being proactive. Don’t look at hot spots as a one-off issue. Instead view them as a chronic condition caused by a deeper underlying condition. You need to address this condition.
Effective preventative care involves establishing a relationship with a homeopathic or holistic vet. Skin lesions like hot spots function as a warning beacon. They’re telling you to treat from within. Strengthen your dog’s digestive and immune function while supporting internal organs.
Many natural modalities prove effective for healing hot spots. This herbal regimen gives your dog relief while allowing her body to respond.
If your dog’s hot spots are an issue, work on the inside. Support her immune system and get her energy flowing.

  When a material is rapidly heated or cooled, the surface and internal temperature will have a difference in temperature. Quick heating or cooling causes thermal expansion or contraction respectively, this localized movement of material causes thermal stresses. Imagine heating a cylinder, first the surface rises in temperature and the center remains the same initial temperature. After some time the center of the cylinder will reach the same temperature as the surface. During the heat up the surface is relatively hotter and will expand more than the center. An example of this is dental fillings can cause thermal stress in a person's mouth. Sometimes dentists use dental fillings with different thermal expansion coefficients than tooth enamel, the fillings will expand faster than the enamel and cause pain in a person's mouth.

  Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal (heat-related), chemical, electrical, and radiation. In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%). Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%), and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1–2% resulting from a suicide attempt. These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%. Burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor. Smoking and alcoholism are other risk factors. Fire-related burns are generally more common in colder climates. Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults.

 Myoma appears most frequently for women in ages between 20 and 50, more so during childbearing ages, and generally shrinks after menopause. Myoma is mostly non-cancerous and asymptomatic if it is small in size. Myoma can, however, pose serious threats depending on its size and location.
Myoma located inside the uterine wall (submucosal myoma) can cause one to be anemic by inducing heavy bleeding during menstruations and /or spotting between periods. Myoma growing at this location can also be a cause for infertility, as it may occupy the implantation position of the fertilized egg.
As myoma grows larger in size, whether it be on the uterine wall (intramural) or on the exterior uterus wall (subserosal), it can create pressure not only on the uterus but also on other organs such as the bladder. Frequent urination, lower abdominal swelling and pain, lower back pain, and feeling heaviness on the lower abdomen are some of the symptoms observed. A large myoma can also be a cause for premature delivery or even miscarriage.
While myoma, or any mass growing on the uterus, is not easy to get rid of, it can be treated with accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In Chinese medicine, myoma is seen as a symptom itself and has several different root causes. Chinese medicine treats both the symptoms and the root causes of myoma. As myoma has the tendency to grow back even after its surgical removal, it is very important to treat the root causes and symptoms simultaneously so that myoma can be removed and not have it grow back again. Chinese herbs along with acupuncture work to diminish the size of myoma and eventually make it disappear without hormonal therapy or surgery. Proper advises for healthy lifestyle pattern and diet must also complement the treatment to prevent any recurrence of myoma.
UTI is a fairly common ailment among women, especially as woman’s urethra is shorter than that of man’s. A first time occurrence of UTI can be treated either with antibiotics or Chinese herbs, with hopes that it would only be a simple infection, and not recur. With repeated recurrence, one would need to think about the underlying cause that brings about the UTI.
Anyone can be diagnosed with UTI just the way one would catch a cold – only in a very unpleasant form. Even the healthiest person can have an ailment when the living environment is not moderate. For instance, a perfectly healthy person could catch a cold by staying outside on a cold, rainy day for an extended period of time. One-time infection could happen as such. If an individual is more prone to catch cold while others are not, it is more likely caused by the individual’s overall body constitution that is responsible for the susceptibility.
Recurrent episodes of UTI immediately tell us that there is some weakness and/or disharmony of internal organs in the body. Possible organ in question could be kidney, urinary bladder, etc. It is important to note that treating only the present symptoms cannot prevent future occurrence for chronic illness. As UTI is an outward symptom of illness in your internal organ, it will naturally be cured by treating both present infection and the root cause. Accurate diagnose and appropriate prescription of Chinese medicine not only treat the current UTI, but prevent its recurrence by enhancing the state of health of the organs and/or balancing their functionality.
Urinary incontinence is a common ailment among the elderly. It limits one’s daily life activities due to frequent urge to urinate. Those with urinary incontinence do not feel inclined to travel long distances, go to theater, or even meet people because of their need to constantly rush to the bathroom. Urinary incontinence is also a cause of disruptions in sleep. Frequent disruptions in sleep due to the need for bathroom trips means they cannot have a restful sleep. This results in tiredness during daytime that limits daily activities. Many people with urinary incontinence are forced to wear diapers through the day and night. For some, even the thickest diapers are not enough at night. Bedwetting is a common problem for elderly with urinary incontinence.
While Urinary bladder holds the urine, the energy to control the urinary bladder and sphincter comes from the kidneys. Urinary incontinence thus usually caused by weak kidneys. This explains why the elderly are more prone to urinary incontinence, as kidneys become weak with age and gradually lose the energy to control urine habits. Hence, urinary incontinence can be controlled by enhancing the kidney and urinary bladder functions.
Zhi Niao San at Woo Shin Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese Medicine formula to control urinary incontinence by enhancing the kidney and bladder energy. By boosting the affected organs, Zhi Niao San significantly reduces urination frequency. Those taking Zhi Niao San have reported much better sleep, more energy during daytime, and also less frequent bathroom trips during daytime.
PMS manifests itself either emotionally or physically, and in many cases, both. Symptoms on the emotional side include depression, anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, aggressiveness, anger, sadness, irritability, and even feeling of guilt for her life before the period. As for physical symptoms, abdominal distention/pain, breasts tenderness/pain, skin problems, edema, lower/higher libido than usual, devouring of food, tiredness, and insomnia are some of the main issues. Duration and severity of PMS can vary amongst individuals. PMS affects not only the quality of the patient’s life but her family and friends as well.
Nevertheless, many individuals perceive the PMS as a normal phenomenon, as PMS has become a common illness in modern world. Given that stress is a main cause for PMS, among other causes (physical strain, excessive consumption of fatty food, blood deficiency, etc.), it is hardly surprising to see so many suffer from PMS in the evermore stressful society in the recent times.
As the menstrual cycle is part of a normal physiological phenomenon for women to maintain healthy body functions, physically healthy and psychologically sound individuals should not have PMS. Put in another way, it is not normal to have PMS, despite its rising numbers today.
As incomprehensible as it may sound the first time you hear it, indecisiveness is a character affected by an internal organ – the gallbladder. If something as simple as deciding what coffee you want in the morning or what to order from the menu is giving you the sweats, it could, of course, be that the choices around us are all too enticing — or, it could just be that your weakened gallbladder is making you a bit more timid when it comes to making decisions.
Gallbladder, in Chinese medicine, is responsible for pumping up the courage to make decisions and take initiatives. It is thus difficult for those with weakened gallbladders to make decisions, whether it be bold ones or trivial.
Those with weak gallbladders tend to be timid, lacking the drive to do things. They are also prone to waking up early in the morning for no apparent external reason. Not being in a healthy state of body, they toss and turn, fall back asleep again, and wake up late. Weakened gallbladder also manifests itself in some individuals with tiredness and depression.
While indecisiveness is not necessarily an illness, it can be a recognizable sign that the gallbladder is not in a very healthy state. Acupuncture, combined with natural herbal medicine treatment, can have great effects to address the matter and bring back your normal self again.
A frequent topic at the clinic, hives affect so many lives in today’s world, and there are so many of them left frustrated at the persistency of the condition. There are people who have lived with hives for varying periods of time ranging up to ten plus years. Uses of anti-histamine either topically or internally, which have grown to be common practice, help relieving the symptoms. The problem with just anti-histamine treatment is that it is difficult to get rid of hives completely. Hives, or hypersensitivity, among other skin disorders, is hard to treat, which is the very reason why people live with it for so many years despite trying variety of treatment.
Causative factors can be vary – stress, cold, hot, food, weather, scratching, tiredness, exposure to sun, lack of sleep, and also no apparent reason at all. Chinese Medicine tells us that hives flare up with disorders in internal organs, even though medical tests do not reveal any abnormality. It could be any organ in the system – liver, spleen, stomach, lung, etc. Disorders in organs can be physiological, emotional, or both.
While it is difficult to treat hives, especially when it becomes chronic, it can be treated with correct diagnosis and treatment accordingly. Since hives are likely to be a chronic condition, Chinese herbs along with acupuncture is strongly recommended.
Hives is an outward symptom of disorders in internal organs, but the problematic organ differs person to person, even though the visible symptoms are the same. Quite naturally, the acupuncture and herbal treatments differ for individuals. It is important that patients see an acupuncturist to diagnose exactly which internal organ is suffering from disorders that caused the symptoms. Acupuncture, along with Chinese herbal medicine, addresses the fundamental health issues by treating the internal organs, rather than focus solely on the outward symptoms.
Food and medicine share the same origin. Every living creature requires food to sustain its life, and a healthy one for that matter, as all necessary nutrients must be derived from a balanced diet. Every food consumed contains a certain degree of medicinal property – just as some food have strong nutritional values while others are less potent, some have strong effects of curing certain diseases while others have milder effect. Hence, Chinese medicine describes medicine as having the same origin as food, outlining the importance of balanced and nutritious meals. Generally, the food we commonly eat in everyday life has only mild therapeutic effects and does not result in any reaction, but rather works to harmonize one’s body system.
Humans have known what to eat and what not to eat by the course of nature. Interestingly, Chinese people have found over course of time that certain medicinal properties of food can be identified by the taste. Some prime examples of taste-to-medicinal properties are shown below.
Primarily affecting the spleen, sweet tasting food generally enhances the energy level by providing calories, harmonizes the body system, and works to comfort the muscular and nervous systems to relieve pain.
Bitter food is known to affect the heart, and has a cold property, or, in Chinese medicine terminology, cold in nature. In effect, bitter food can work to relieving fever and inflammation, and also work as natural antibiotic and antiviral. There are only a few bitter foods in an ordinary diet, and, perhaps naturally, those are some of the effective medicines treating ailments.
Primarily having effects on the liver, sour food can work as an astringent to stop diarrhea, runny nose, sweat, and abnormal discharges such as those from leucorrhea. Sour food also generates fluids to help relieve thirst, which can come as a relief for excessive thirst from diabetes.
Salty food mostly affects the kidney, and works as softeners and creates a flow downward in the digestive system. Effectively, salty food can work to relieve constipation as a purgative. Other effects include dissolving of hard masses such as tumors, lumps, nodules, etc.
Having most notable effects on the lungs, acrid and pungent food is generally aromatic, having the properties to scatter, move, and disperse. This works to transport blood, fluid, and qi when stagnated. Acrid and pungent food is mostly warm or hot in nature, and, in effect, helps to warm the human body from the inside when one feels cold.
Bland food can affect the lung, spleen, stomach, and urinary bladder. Bland food is good for water retention, which can work to treat edema. Bland food also works well in losing weight, as well as treating hyperglycemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
As most food has more than one taste, it assumes more than one therapeutic effect. Using the above lists as guide, one can choose his or her diet depending on the health conditions. Although what we consume as regular diet has only mild medicinal effects, it is important that we do not over-consume any one selected category of food. A well-balanced diet is the foundation of a healthy life.
Emotions are a central element to what makes us human, yet it cannot be scientifically measured or digitized. Nonetheless, their effects on health and the associated physical symptoms are very real.
Chinese medicine tells us of five categories of emotions with potential effects on the human internal organs with enough dose: sadness, joy, worry, anger, and fright. Each emotion is associated with a specific organ: Lung is effected by sadness, heart by joy, spleen by worry, liver by anger, and kidney by fear or fright. What we need to watch out for is frequent bursts of emotions or prolonged period of emotional state, which may damage the associated organs, actually doing physical harm in the form of emotional stress. Chinese Medicine puts substantial focus on emotional stress in treating and preventing numerous illnesses. Below is a highlight of relationships between each emotion and organ.
Needless to say, sadness is a natural human emotion. Prolonged period of sadness or excessive degree of sadness, however, can adversely affect the lung, potentially causing various health complications.
Take a case study of a patient who lost her spouse. So great was her grief, and understandably so, she lived in sadness for over 10 years. Once an active and energetic businesswoman, she gradually lost energy in her daily life, and developed constipation and COPD seven years after losing her spouse. Such profound effects of human emotion are only too common around us. In Chinese Medicine, the lung is associated with sadness, which can affect the energy level, as well as having an effect on the large intestine. Acupuncture treatments for the aforementioned patient were focused on revival of her lung functions, which have indeed produced positive results.
One cannot prevent becoming sad, as sadness is a natural human emotion, but it is important to seek help to cope with and overcome the suffering. Deep and lingering sadness can do great harm to body and soul. There are various options, and acupuncture is one that can directly address both physical and emotional damages done by sadness.
It may seem strange to find joy under the category of potentially harmful emotion. Sure enough, joy is the opposite of sadness. Joy, like all other emotions, is a natural emotion we feel in normal daily life. Complications arise, however, with excessive bursts of it. Heart is the organ affected by excessive joy. Palpitation, crying, shortness of breath, red face, difficulty in speech, and insomnia are some of the symptoms of excessive joy. For most people, these symptoms disappear as the emotion returns to normal state, in a few days at most. For others, they can develop into recurring conditions due to frequent occasions of excessive joy or to a pre-existing conditions such as heart issues.
In rare occasions, extreme joy can be a cause of death. A death has been reported at the World Cup soccer match after which an elderly died of heart attack, following a victory of his supporting team.
Palpitation in itself is a symptom to a problem that needs medical attention. Excessive emotions, including joy, can be cause to visible symptoms like palpitation. Whether emotions are involved or not, acupuncture, along with other forms of Chinese medicine, can help attending to the health of the heart.
The organ most affected by worry is spleen, as is documented in the Chinese medicine literature. Appetite drops in state of worry, as the spleen controls appetite and can be the cause for abdominal distention and diarrhea due to its close association with the stomach. In Chinese medicine, Spleen produces Qi by absorbing the essence of digested food from the stomach. A healthy spleen of a worry-free individual would therefore result in a high-level of energy. On the other hand, when you are in a deep worry, the spleen, in its poor form, fails to work properly to generate appetite. In turn, the stomach cannot accept sufficient amount of food due to the dropped appetite, and also experiences difficulty digesting food, potentially causing abdominal distention. Even if you were able to eat, indigestion and diarrhea often follow. Consequently, the stomach provides only so much essence to your spleen, resulting in dropped level of energy in your body. This causes a vicious cycle of further-dropped appetite, which may eventually induce more serious implications, including tumors or even cancers.
Do not take any emotional stress for granted. Acupuncture has an excellent efficacy for stress that has been empirically proven for thousands of years.
Liver is the organ associated with anger. Some of the most serious illnesses that we encounter at the clinic are caused by anger. Common symptoms include red face, red eyes, breathlessness, high blood pressure, blurred vision, dizziness, unconsciousness, incoherent speech, and, and severe cases, stroke.
Anger produces heat in liver. The redness in the face and eyes are caused by the heat from the liver travelling upward. Blood volume can quickly decrease as it is dried up from the heat. Not enough nourishment is transported through the human body, and the face in particular, when there is not enough blood. This malnourishment caused by lack of blood can subsequently cause the above-mentioned symptoms. Stroke is an extreme example of its consequences – it too is caused by the lack of blood flow to the brain. Diabetes is an illness sometimes caused by severe anger. While the head is the most commonly affected area, anger can cause problems in all parts of the body, as the heat produced in the Liver can quickly spread to elsewhere.
Acupuncture treats both the illness caused by anger and the anger itself. As with all illnesses, the earlier you seek treatment, the more effective and quicker you will see results.
People wetting their pants from fear or frightful experiences is a very real symptom, caused by the kidney being drained of Qi from fear. Urinary bladder functions to hold and release urine, but the qi that controls the urinary bladder comes from kidney. Due to this close relationship between urinary bladder and kidney, the urinary bladder weakens as the kidney weakens. This is why, when gripped by extreme fear, the urinary functions cannot be controlled at will. This can be seen more clearly with young children, whose kidneys are not yet fully developed, with bedwetting episodes at night, and even pants wetting during the day when exposed to a very frightful situation. As children grow up, the kidney will eventually develop to be stronger. However, if the bedwetting is persistent as they grow up, it means their kidneys are weakened for one reason or another and treatments become necessary. Adults can experience the same symptoms under the same circumstances when their kidneys are weak. Treatments should be focused on strengthening of the kidney and relaxing of mind at the same time.
Common cold – a self-explanatory name – is common to people of all ages and both sexes. Common cold is called flu, when taken more severe symptoms and becomes endemic to spread to a large number of people. We are prone to catch cold all year round, but more so during winter and spring time, especially with seasonal changes where temperature fluctuates in wide ranges throughout the day. Cold typically runs its own course until recovery, which may last anywhere from a week to three weeks, depending on its severity and one’s physical conditions.
That said, the duration and severity of symptoms can be remarkably reduced when acupuncture treatment is given at the beginning stage of cold. With proper treatment at early signs of cold, perhaps within the first day or two, it is not uncommon to see full recovery from cold within the next day or two. If you feel you have caught a cold, do not wait for acupuncture treatment. As is with most illnesses, time is of the essence. The sooner it is to receive treatment, the quicker it is for your body to recover.
Beauty puncture is an anti-aging treatment of your face, mostly needling the face and few other acupuncture points to strengthen the body-constitution as a whole, resulting in younger and healthier and younger facial skin. By needling facial points directly related to body organs (mostly digestive organs, including stomach, intestine, liver, etc.), the digestive system gets a boost with good qi (energy) movement, thus enhancing metabolism and constitution, which in turn revitalizes the skin. The local needling on the face also directly boosts the qi movement and blood circulation of the face.
The common myth of the beauty puncture is that one could see drastic changes on the face immediately after treatment, as you would after cosmetic surgeries.
Beauty Puncture is not surgery. It does not directly remove aging spots or wrinkles by removing loose skin as surgery would, but rather strengthens the skin to have enough turgor to prevent wrinkles. It can also remove or lighten aging spots by enhancing the whole body constitution – what is known as the holistic treatment. The body needs time to regenerate and recover tissues through a series of treatments – ranging from five to seven, before you can physically see the difference. While the slow process might seem discouraging, it offers not only the healthier skin but also enhancements to the whole body constitution. As changes are made with the holistic point of view, beauty puncture has no complication that may arise from cosmetic surgery, including but not limited to scar which causes blockage of qi and blood movement – something that accelerates the aging process.
Acupuncturists have found an acupuncture point for a healthy baby over a long time. This point, inserted on both legs with gold needles between the 1st and 2nd trimester of a pregnancy, will help one have a baby with healthy body and mind. We call this the “beautiful baby point”.
Acupuncture has been practiced for over 2000 years for treating various illnesses as well as promoting wellbeing throughout the history of China.
Based on its holistic view in human body, traditional Chinese medicine has established a comprehensive system of natural methods of healing ailments. Today, for its highly individualized and customized healing mechanism and its ability to revitalize body’s healing facility, traditional Chinese medicine is providing its benefits to the people around the globe.
One of many doctrines in traditional Chinese medicine in treatment is one that relates emotions to body organs. When one is overly excited with certain emotion, the corresponding organ may be affected in one way or another.

 1 -7.60335  In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns. Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%. Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire. Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam. Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns. Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30% of burns in children. Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact. Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries. This is a particular risk for adolescent males. In the United States, For non-fatal burn injuries, white males, aged <6 comprise most cases. Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.
 2 -8.91339  A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn). Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females, the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault). Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or 
 3 -9.13521 Burn injuries are among the most horrific and excruciating one can endure. As the skin is the largest organ of the body, it possesses billions of neuron receptors—or nerves as they are commonly known—that signal feelings such as temperature or pain.
When functioning as normal, these neuron receptors on the skin send signals like “too cold” or “too hot” to the brain and the individual acts appropriately: putting on or taking off a sweater, jumping in a pool, drinking some hot coffee, and so on.
Normally, the pain response triggers a reflex as the affected area tries to avoid damage. In the event of a minor burn, or medically known as a first-degree burn injury, the outer layer of the skin, or the epidermis, is damaged. Burned individuals might treat the wound simply by pouring cold water over the hurt area. However, the damage is usually superficial and may leave little more than a minor scar.
However, in terms of more serious burn injuries, such as those caused by second-degree or third-degree burns, skin layers beneath the epidermis are affected. It is also possible that bone or organ tissues can be impacted as well, leading to serious and potentially-fatal circumstances.
Structure fires are commonly the cause of fire deaths or injuries in either a residential or office setting. Oftentimes, these fires start from faulty electrical or heating equipment, sometimes as a result of poor maintenance routines.
Most clothing is especially susceptible to fire, which can trap individuals in spreading flames. While clothing sold in the USA is meant to comply with the Flammable Fabrics Act, injuries from burning clothing are still very possible.
Automobile fires usually start as a result of an auto accident. This can include gas or engine block explosions and fires started as a result of a collision. Trapped or unconscious individuals may be especially at risk of injury.
Chemical burns are most often caused by acids or strong base chemicals. Laboratories and chemical factories are the most common places for such incidents to occur, though household chemicals can be potent enough as well.
In most chemical burns, the skin is dissolved upon contact and even vigorous washing may not rid the affected areas of dangerous chemicals, causing further damage.
Thermal burns occur most often after an individual is exposed to steam, flames, or hot surfaces or liquids. More broadly, coming into contact with anything exceeding a temperature of 115 degrees has the potential to cause a thermal burn.
Electrical burns occur when an individual is exposed to high voltage electricity. Most commonly, these injuries are work-related. Highly dangerous, electricity flows through the body in search of the easiest path of resistance towards a ground. This can cause exit wounds in addition to the initial point of contact, stop organs from functioning, and damage all surrounding tissue; any of which can cause death.
Regrow skin: The affected skin may no longer be able to regrow. Depending on the severity and location of the burn, surgeons may conduct a skin graft operation, which moves healthy skin to the affected area. Alternatively, medical advances have allowed for new treatments such as the use of artificial skin.
Retain skin elasticity: Healthy skin is highly elastic; otherwise, it would easily tear. Even minor burns can hinder or prevent the skin from retaining its elasticity.
Retain their sense of feeling: Because burns tend to destroy nerve endings in victims, the skin may lose some or all sense of feeling, including touch and temperature.
Perspire: The ability for an affected individual to perspire can also be hampered or lost. Depending on the size and location of the burn, this can prevent the body from being able to adequately regulate its temperature, making individuals far more susceptible to hyperthermia or hypothermia (dangerously high or low body temperature).
Endure hot weather: Burned skin loses its natural ability to protect the individual from sun damage and will need to be protected from the elements.
Prevent infection: Burned skin not only loses its ability to protect an individual from infection, it makes it far more likely as bacteria and other pathogens pool around dead skin. This necessitates new healthy skin to be grafted to the area else the risk of infection remains excessively high.
Burns, regardless of their point of origin, can result in shocking injuries, or even death. Medical treatment can be extensive and painful, often requiring multiple skin graft operations. Unfortunately, because there are so many different potential causes for burn injuries, there are no broad-sweeping standards for who may be liable in the event of a burn injury or fatality. Burn victims, or in the case of death, the families of burn victims, should seek legal counsel.
Kamran Yadidi Law Group’s professional team has significant experience with cases that relate to burn injuries. The firm was founded in 1996 by Kamran Yadidi, a well-known burn injury lawyer. The veteran attorneys at Kamran Yadidi Law Group have worked on over 10,000 personal injury cases, including numerous cases where clients have unfairly been subjected to burn injuries.

 4 -9.35869  Older people are more likely to suffer from heatstroke than younger people due to dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medication, and diseases involving the thermoregulatory system. If left untreated, heatstroke can fail to reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors may suffer long-term disability.
 5 -9.47031  At temperatures greater than 44 C, proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down. This results in cell and tissue damage. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium. In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss, making the blood more concentrated. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers. Increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years. This is associated with increased cardiac output, metabolism, a fast heart rate, and poor immune function.

  The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The left and right sides of the heart have different functions: the right side receives blood coming from the body through the superior and inferior venae cavae and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while the left side receives saturated blood from the lungs.

  The heart has the shape of a pyramid, with its apex pointing towards the left nipple while its base forms the posterior surface of the heart. Other surfaces are the anterior, inferior (or diaphragmatic), and two pulmonary surfaces facing the lungs. Its longest dimension (apical to base) is broadly 12–13 cm, while the average weight is 250 grams in females and 300 grams in males. Its primary role is to receive the blood from the body, pump it to the lungs to be oxygenated, and receive it once more to pump it again to the rest of the human body tissues. The right side of the heart (which consists of the

  The Heart, arteries, and veins (a network of tubes to carry blood) constitute the cardiovascular system or circulatory system of our body which transports the blood throughout the body. The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins make up the vasculature. The cardiovascular system circulates about 5 liters of blood at a rate of approximately 6 L/m. The pulmonary and the systemic circulations are the two parts of the vasculature. The pulmonary circulation system consists of the network of blood vessels from the right heart to the lungs and back to the left heart.

  The principal circulatory organ is the animal's heart which is located within a pericardial sack on the animal's left side near its head. The heart consists of a single (morphologically left) auricle, a single large and muscular ventricle, and the muscular but much smaller bulbous aorta below it which joins the posterior and anterior aortae. The posterior aorta opens into the visceral sinus, delivering blood to the gonad and digestive gland; the anterior aorta sends blood forward into the buccal mass. The ctenidium contains blood spaces and receives oxygen. B. secunda does not have a series of arteries and veins— like all gastropods and indeed all molluscs, its blood is retained within various open body cavities or "sinuses" collectively referred to as a hemocoel.

 In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The left atrium and left ventricle are referred to as the left heart, while the right atrium and right ventricle are known as the right heart. This four-chambered structure allows for efficient blood flow and separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

The heart's chambers work together in a coordinated manner to pump blood throughout the body. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, the blood moves into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood into the pulmonary circulation - the pathway leading to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide.

The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. This systemic circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients to the various tissues and organs, ensuring their proper function.

The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure that it moves in a unidirectional manner. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid.

It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body.

 The heart is a muscular organ that plays a crucial role in circulating blood throughout the body. It is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and returning deoxygenated blood back to the lungs for oxygenation. 

In humans and other mammals, as well as birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: the upper left and right atria, and the lower left and right ventricles. The right atrium and ventricle are commonly referred to as the right heart, while their left counterparts are known as the left heart. Fish have two chambers (an atrium and a ventricle), while reptiles have three chambers.

To ensure proper blood flow, the heart is equipped with valves that prevent backflow, allowing blood to flow in one direction. These valves open and close synchronously with the heartbeat.

The heart itself is surrounded by a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid. Its wall is composed of three layers: the outermost epicardium, the middle myocardium (which is responsible for the heart's muscular contraction), and the innermost endocardium.

By continuously pumping blood, the heart supplies the body with oxygen and essential nutrients, while also aiding in the removal of metabolic wastes. Its rhythmic contractions, regulated by electrical impulses, help maintain blood pressure and ensure proper circulation throughout the body.

  atrium and the right ventricle) receives the desaturated blood, while the left side (consisting of the left atrium and left ventricle) receives the oxygenated blood. The pericardium is a thick membrane that covers the heart. It consists of two layers: the fibrous pericardium and the serous pericardium. It forms two recesses: the transverse recess and oblique recess. The transverse recess lies behind the aorta and pulmonary trunk, while the oblique recess lies behind the left atrium. Serous pericardium is thin and covers the heart. It is also called the epicardium. The fibrous pericardium is much thicker. Together they form the pericardial cavity, a thin sac hosting a small amount of fluid.

  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve and pumps it to the lungs. The right ventricle lies behind the sternum and forms a large part of the sternodiaphragmatical surface of the heart. Its inferior surface lies over the central tendon of the diaphragm. The right ventricle consists of an inlet portion that receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. There is an apical portion that approaches- but does not reach- the apex of the heart; this apical portion is packed with rough trabeculations. Last portion is a muscular outlet portion (infudibulum) that pumps the blood to the pulmonary artery. The atrioventricular groove, a grove that harbors the right coronary artery of the heart, marks the separation of the atrium and the ventricle. Internally, Crista supraventricularis, a muscular thickening, separates the right ventricle into two spaces.

  The left ventricle is made of thick muscle walls, as power is needed to push blood to the arterial system of the body. It is conical in shape and occupies part of the anterior (sternocostal), inferior (diaphragmatical), and left wall of heart. It receives blood from the right atrium through the mitral valve and pumps it to the body through the aortic valve. It consists of an inlet portion (ostium venosum), an outlet portion (ostium arteriosum), and an apical portion. The anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles are two strong papillary muscles within the left ventricle that anchor the two leaflets of the mitral valve (the valve between left atrium and ventricle consists of two leaflets). While these two muscles have a thick muscular base, they separate to various tendinous cords before entering the leaflets of the mitral valve. Apical portion is conical and consists of fine trabeculations.

 The heart is a four-chambered, hollow organ that is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It is approximately the size of a clenched fist and is located beneath the breastbone in the center of the chest cavity. The heart is surrounded by a double-walled sac called the pericardium, which helps anchor it in place with connections to the diaphragm and sternum.

The heart consists of two sides, separated by a thick, muscular wall called the septum. The right atrium and left atrium are the two upper chambers, while the left and right ventricles are the lower chambers. The atria receive blood coming in from the lungs and the body, and then contract to squeeze blood into the ventricles. The ventricles then pump the blood out to the lungs and the rest of the body.

To prevent the backward flow of blood, the heart has valves. The valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle is called the mitral valve, and the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve. There are also two other valves located between the ventricles and the major blood vessels. One valve leads to the lungs and is called the pulmonic valve, while the other valve leads to the rest of the body and is called the aortic valve.

The muscles in the heart are made up of cells called myocytes. The heart initially grows and develops from these myocytes, and by the age of 6 months, an infant's heart contains the adult number of myocytes. However, certain chemotherapy drugs, such as anthracyclines, may damage or destroy these myocytes, leading to heart muscle damage. This can result in heart problems and may require medical intervention.

Overall, the structure of the heart allows it to efficiently pump blood throughout the body, while its valves prevent the backward flow of blood. The heart's muscle cells, known as myocytes, play a crucial role in its function, and any damage to these cells can potentially impact the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

It is approximately the size of a clenched fist and is located beneath the breastbone in the center of the chest cavity. The heart is surrounded by a double-walled sac called the pericardium, which helps anchor it in place with connections to the diaphragm and sternum.

The heart consists of two sides, separated by a thick, muscular wall called the septum. The right atrium and left atrium are the two upper chambers, while the left and right ventricles are the lower chambers. The atria receive blood coming in from the lungs and the body, and then contract to squeeze blood into the ventricles. The ventricles then pump the blood out to the lungs and the rest of the body.

To prevent the backward flow of blood, the heart has valves. The valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle is called the mitral valve, and the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve. There are also two other valves located between the ventricles and the major blood vessels. One valve leads to the lungs and is called the pulmonic valve, while the other valve leads to the rest of the body and is called the aortic valve.

The muscles in the heart are made up of cells called myocytes. The heart initially grows and develops from these myocytes, and by the age of 6 months, an infant's heart contains the adult number of myocytes. However, certain chemotherapy drugs, such as anthracyclines, may damage or destroy these myocytes, leading to heart muscle damage. This can result in heart problems and may require medical intervention.

Overall, the structure of the heart allows it to efficiently pump blood throughout the body, while its valves prevent the backward flow of blood. The heart's muscle cells, known as myocytes, play a crucial role in its function, and any damage to these cells can potentially impact the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.
 4 -10.79316  The heart has the shape of a pyramid, with its apex pointing towards the left nipple while its base forms the posterior surface of the heart. Other surfaces are the anterior, inferior (or diaphragmatic), and two pulmonary surfaces facing the lungs. Its longest dimension (apical to base) is broadly 12–13 cm, while the average weight is 250 grams in females and 300 grams in males. Its primary role is to receive the blood from the body, pump it to the lungs to be oxygenated, and receive it once more to pump it again to the rest of the human body tissues. The right side of the heart (which consists of the 
 5 -10.98995 In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The left atrium and left ventricle are referred to as the left heart, while the right atrium and right ventricle are known as the right heart. This four-chambered structure allows for efficient blood flow and separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

The heart's chambers work together in a coordinated manner to pump blood throughout the body. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, the blood moves into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood into the pulmonary circulation - the pathway leading to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide.

The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. This systemic circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients to the various tissues and organs, ensuring their proper function.

The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure that it moves in a unidirectional manner. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid.

It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body.

Blue and yellow streamers were playing in the lurid fire; and, sometimes starting side by side from the wide expanse of the illuminated arch, they melt into each other, and throw a ghostly glare of green into the face and over the landscape. Again this green overrides the red; blue and orange clasp each other in their rapid flight; violet darts tear through a broad flush of yellow, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of these uniting streams, rush aloft and lick the skies."

  The sunsets on Titan are expected to be "underwhelming events", where the Sun disappears about half-way up in the sky (~50° above the horizon) with no distinct change in color.

Most scholarly opinions follow the Hanafi school, that Isha'a begins when complete darkness has arrived and the yellow twilight in the sky has disappeared. ; According to a minority opinion in the Maliki school, the prescribed time for Maghrib prayer ends when the red thread has disappeared from the sky. In another opinion of the Shafi'i school, the disappearance of the red thread marks the end of the Period of Necessity. These times can be approximated by using the sun as a measure. When the sun has descended 12 degrees below the horizon, it is approximately equivalent to the disappearance of the red from the sky. For approximating when complete darkness begins, i.e. the disappearance of the white thread from the sky, some astronomers argue that it occurs when the sun has descended 15 degrees below the horizon while others use the safer number of 18 degrees.  Astronomical twilight occurs when the sun is between 12 degrees and 18 degrees below the horizon. Time begins Time ends

["The ocean is a vast and powerful source of energy, and scientists have been exploring ways to harness this energy for decades. One of the most promising methods for producing electricity from the ocean is through the use of tidal energy.\n\nTidal energy is produced by the movement of the tides, which are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. This movement can be harnessed by using underwater turbines, which are similar to wind turbines but are designed to operate in the ocean.\n\nThe turbines are placed in strategic locations where the tides are strongest, and as the water flows in and out, the turbines spin, generating electricity. This electricity can then be transmitted to the mainland and used to power homes and businesses.\n\nAnother method for producing electricity from the ocean is through the use of wave energy. This involves using buoys or other devices to capture the energy from ocean waves and convert it into electricity.\n\nWhile these methods are still in the experimental phase, they have the potential to provide a significant source of renewable energy. In fact, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, tidal energy has the potential to provide up to 10% of the world's electricity needs.\n\nIn addition to being a renewable source of energy, tidal energy also has the potential to be more reliable than other forms of renewable energy, such as wind and solar.", 'How is electricity produced from the ocean?How is electricity produced from the ocean?\nA. decaying organic material from sealife\nB. energy is accessed underwater from tides\nC. drills to access oil supplies\nD. chemical reactions produced from the salt in the water']

  The generation of tidal power is highly predictable due to the deterministic nature of tides, and independent of weather conditions or climate change. Power output varies with the tidal phase (ebb & flow, neap & spring) but the shorter terms effects can be avoided by combining two dams, placed at certain distance from each other (in the order of 150–250 km), each generating maximum electricity output when the other is generating minimal output. This provides a predictable and fairly stable base generation to the energy grid.

  The rise and fall of the oceans due to tidal effects is a key influence upon the coastal areas. Ocean tides on the planet Earth are created by the gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon. The tides produced by these two bodies are roughly comparable in magnitude, but the orbital motion of the Moon results in tidal patterns that vary over the course of a month. The ebb and flow of the tides produce a cyclical current along the coast, and the strength of this current can be quite dramatic along narrow estuaries. Incoming tides can also produce a tidal bore along a river or narrow bay as the water flow against the current results in

  paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.  Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are photo-voltaic cells that are organized into panels and concentrated solar power, which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an electrical generator via a steam turbine or heat engine, or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells. The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a direct current and has to be converted to alternating current before it can be used in a household. At this point,

The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures. The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high–flow and low–head water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by eductors before releasing into the sea. Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically.

  Natural Currents Energy Services, LLC is a developer and installer of hydro-electric systems. They produce scalable underwater turbines designed to capture energy from the tides of rivers and oceans. They hold Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) energy development permits at ten sites in the US, roughly 25% of the total tidal zone permits granted by FERC. The company has designed two models of turbine, the Red Hawk Tidal Power Generator and the Sea Dragon Tidal Turbine. Natural Currents has partnered with the City College of New York to assess sites with potential for tidal power development. The 18-month study is funded by grants from the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the University Transportation Research Center. On March 5, 2012, Natural currents released results from a study of tidal currents off the coast of New Jersey for 2008 to 2009. The findings indicate a conservative estimate of 417 MW of potential tidal power in New Jersey, compared to the 357 MW measured by a Georgia Tech Report in 2011.

Power output varies with the tidal phase (ebb & flow, neap & spring) but the shorter terms effects can be avoided by combining two dams, placed at certain distance from each other (in the order of 150–250 km), each generating maximum electricity output when the other is generating minimal output. useful forms of power - mainly electricity, dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons, tidal barrages ; Wave power is the transport of energy by ocean surface waves, and the capture of that energy to do useful work — for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or the pumping of water (into reservoirs). ; Wind energy is the kinetic energy of air in motion;Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electricity, windmills for mechanical power, windpumps for water pumping or drainage, or sails to propel ships

['The life work of a flower is to attract pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, with its vibrant colors and sweet fragrances. This is achieved through a process called pollination, which is essential for the survival of many plant species. During pollination, the pollen from the male reproductive organ of the flower is transferred to the female reproductive organ of another flower of the same species, resulting in the fertilization of the egg and the production of seeds. This process not only ensures the continuation of the species but also provides food for the pollinators. In addition to their reproductive function, flowers also serve as a source of beauty and inspiration for humans. They are often used in art, literature, and music, and are a popular subject for photography and painting. The beauty and fragility of flowers have inspired countless poets and writers, and have been a source of inspiration for many artists throughout history. Overall, the life work of a flower is to ensure the continuation of its species through pollination, while also providing beauty and inspiration to humans.', 'The life work of a flower is toThe life work of a flower is to\nA. provide nice scents\nB. be successfully fertilized\nC. grow very tall\nD. look pretty']

  Pollination is the transfer of pollen from an anther (male part) of a plant to the stigma (female part) of a plant, later enabling fertilisation and the production of seeds, most often by an animal or by wind. Pollinating agents are animals such as insects, birds, and bats; water; wind; and even plants themselves, when self-pollination occurs within a closed flower. Pollination often occurs within a species. When pollination occurs between species it can produce hybrid offspring in nature and in plant breeding work. In angiosperms, after the pollen grain (gametophyte) has landed on the stigma, it germinates and develops a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches an ovary. Its two gametes travel down the tube to where the

  have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube. The study of pollination spans many disciplines, such as botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. The pollination process as an interaction between flower and pollen vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian Konrad Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and agriculture, because fruiting is dependent on fertilization: the result of pollination. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology. There are also studies in economics that look at the positive and negative benefits of pollination, focused on bees, and how the process affects the pollinators themselves.

 Some of the factors that contribute to the reproductive success of the alpine buttercup include flower heliotropism, internal flower temperature, fly pollination, and seed production. The alpine snow buttercup Ranunculus adoneus exhibits flower heliotropism, which means that its flowers track the movement of the sun from early morning until mid-afternoon. This allows the flowers to align parallel to the sun's rays, resulting in higher internal flower temperatures. Flowers aligned with the sun attract fly pollinators more often, as flies spend more time on tracking flowers.

Fly visitation is crucial for the fecundity of the alpine buttercup. Experiments that excluded flies from the flowers showed a significant decrease in seed production compared to handoutcrossed or open-pollinated flowers. This indicates that fly pollination plays an important role in the reproductive success of this plant species.

Moreover, the angle at which the flowers deviate from the sun also affects the internal flower temperature. As the angle increases beyond 45 degrees, the internal temperature significantly decreases. This suggests that proper alignment with the sun's rays is necessary for optimal reproductive success.

Tethering the flowers at random angles to prevent solar tracking resulted in fewer and smaller seeds compared to unmanipulated control flowers. This effect was more pronounced during the early season and can be attributed to either pollinator discrimination, post-pollination developmental processes, or both. However, experiments using fluorescent dye particles as pollen analogs indicated that solar tracking fidelity may not have a significant effect on the pollen dispersal component of male reproduction.

In summary, the factors that contribute to the reproductive success of the alpine buttercup include flower heliotropism, which leads to higher internal flower temperatures, increased fly pollination, and overall higher seed production. Proper alignment with the sun's rays is crucial for attracting pollinators and ensuring optimal reproduction.

  Pollination may be biotic or abiotic. Biotic pollination relies on living pollinators to move the pollen from one flower to another. Abiotic pollination relies on wind, water or even rain. About 80% of angiosperms rely on biotic pollination.

 The purpose of measuring the pollen/ovule ratio and percentage pollen germination in Commelina benghalensis flowers is to understand the pollination system of the species and determine the extent of outcrossing. In Commelina benghalensis, there are two types of flowers: chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL). CH flowers have both male and female reproductive phases that overlap, allowing for self-pollination. However, there are exceptions where some CH flowers mature their female phase before anther dehiscence or have sterile anthers, facilitating cross-pollination.

By measuring the pollen/ovule ratio, researchers can assess the amount of pollen available for fertilization in relation to the number of ovules present. This ratio provides insights into the effectiveness of pollen transfer and the potential for successful fertilization.

Percentage pollen germination on the stigmas of CH and CL flowers is another index used to understand the pollination system. This measurement helps determine the viability of the pollen and its ability to germinate on the stigmas. By comparing the germination rates between CH and CL flowers, researchers can gain an understanding of the reproductive strategies and potential for both self-pollination and cross-pollination in the species.

Confirmation of the pollination system in Commelina benghalensis is sought through manual pollination experiments, comparing the fruit and seed sets obtained from self-pollination and cross-pollination with natural pollination. These experiments help validate the findings obtained from measuring the pollen/ovule ratio and percentage pollen germination.

Overall, measuring the pollen/ovule ratio and percentage pollen germination in Commelina benghalensis flowers provides valuable information on the pollination system of the species, including the extent of outcrossing and the presence of different reproductive strategies within the population.

 The purpose of large, showy flowers in the autogamous carnivorous plant species Drosophyllum lusitanicum is to attract prey insects that serve as a source of nutrients. While autogamous plants are expected to have smaller flowers that conserve resources, Drosophyllum lusitanicum is an exception. The large, yellow flowers of this species act as an attracting device for prey insects. However, research has shown that the removal of flowers did not significantly affect the number of prey insects trapped. This suggests that the primary purpose of the large flowers may not be to attract prey insects.

Instead, the maintenance of large, conspicuous flowers in Drosophyllum lusitanicum is believed to be associated with its reproductive strategy. This species relies on autogamous self-pollination for reproduction. In the study, bagged, hand-pollinated flowers and unbagged flowers exposed to insect visitation showed significant increases in seed set compared to bagged, non-manipulated flowers that could only self-pollinate autonomously. The key life-history strategy of this species is to maintain a viable seed bank, and any increase in seed set through insect pollinator activity would enhance plant fitness.

Therefore, the purpose of the large, showy flowers in Drosophyllum lusitanicum is likely linked to their role in promoting insect-mediated pollination, which can increase seed set and enhance the plant's reproductive success.

  Bakerian mimicry, named after Herbert G. Baker, is a form of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, cheating pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae. Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry is a form of reproductive floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.

  Abiotic pollination uses nonliving methods such as wind and water to move pollen from one flower to another. This allows the plant to spend energy directly on pollen rather than on attracting pollinators with flowers and nectar. Pollination by wind is more common amongst abiotic pollination.

 The integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants contributes to their individuality as organisms in various ways. The effective architecture of plants as modular systems with fixed and mobile elements allows for a coordinated functioning of different parts of the plant. 

By integrating fixed structures such as the root system and the main stem, plants provide a stable foundation and structural support. The roots anchor the plant in the soil, absorbing water and nutrients necessary for its growth and development. Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight.

On the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, capturing sunlight and converting it into energy for the plant. Flowers, through their attractive color and fragrance, facilitate pollination by attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition.

The integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil and transport them to the leaves, where photosynthesis occurs. The products of photosynthesis are then distributed to other parts of the plant, supporting growth and reproduction.

Defense mechanisms are also enhanced through the integration of fixed and mobile modules. For example, thorns on branches and leaves act as deterrents to herbivores. When a herbivore tries to feed on a plant, it encounters physical resistance from these structures. Additionally, some plants produce chemical compounds in their leaves or flowers that act as natural pesticides or repellents against pests.

The integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. Flowers attract pollinators and provide a platform for the exchange of pollen, which leads to fertilization and the production of seeds. In some cases, the flowers themselves may undergo a mobile transformation, such as wilting after pollination or dispersing seeds through wind or animal assistance.

In conclusion, the integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants allows for a coordinated functioning of different parts, promoting stability, adaptability, and reproductive success. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms.

['The human eye is capable of seeing objects that are as small as 0.005 millimeters in size. This is known as the resolution limit of the eye. However, the ability to see small objects decreases as the distance between the object and the eye increases. This is due to the fact that the size of an object and the ability to see it more easily have an inverse relationship. In other words, as an object gets smaller, it becomes more difficult to see, and as an object gets farther away, it becomes more difficult to see.\n\nThe resolution limit of the eye is determined by the size of the pupil and the length of the eye. The pupil is the black circular opening in the center of the iris. When light enters the eye, it passes through the pupil and enters the lens. The lens then focuses the light onto the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The size of the pupil determines how much light can enter the eye, and the length of the eye determines how much the light is magnified before it reaches the retina.\n\nThe size of an object and the ability to see it more easily have an inverse relationship because the size of an object determines how much light it reflects. Small objects reflect less light than large objects, which makes them more difficult to see.

   The eye needs to be held at a certain distance behind the eye lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called the eye relief. A larger eye relief means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if the eye relief is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold the eye in the correct position for an extended period of time, for which reason some eyepieces with long eye relief have cups behind the eye lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. The eye pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the

  Visual acuity is the eyes ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a "person of normal vision" at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is used in countries using the metric system, and that represents the distance in metres. This is often measured with a Snellen chart or LogMAR chart

  If one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°. Thus they have the same retinal image size which determines the size of the retinal image.

  When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. In the middle of the retina is the fovea, which contains a high concentration of cones. Cones are responsible for colour vision and have high spatial acuity, whereas rods are not. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light. Cones are much more sparsely located in the periphery of the retina, where there is instead a greater concentration of rods. When a central image is projected directly

  Knapp's Rule states that lenses placed at the anterior focal point of the eye, generally 15 mm in front of the eye, will create similarly sized images on the retina, whenever the disparity between the two eyes is due to a difference in axial length of the eyes. When a refractive error is corrected with spectacle lenses, the retinal images change size. It is magnified with convex lenses and minified with concave lenses. One difficulty, then, in prescribing glasses to an individual with a disparity in refractive error between the two eyes is that a disparity in image size between the two eyes may be created. There is some controversy as to the soundness of Knapp's Rule.

  of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass. Eye relief typically ranges from about 2 mm to 20 mm, depending on the construction of the eyepiece. Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample eye relief, but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short-focal length have had a short eye relief. Good design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5–6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of eye relief to accommodate their glasses.

  human eye can perceive." Apple fan website CultOfMac hosts an article by John Brownlee who incorrectly stated that the resolution the human eye can discern at 12 inches is 900 PPI, concluding "Apple's Retina Displays are only about 33% of the way there." On the topic of 20/20 vision, Brownlee misrepresented visual acuity in the population saying "most research suggests that normal vision is actually much better than 20/20" when in truth the majority have worse than 20/20 vision, and the WHO considers average vision as 20/40. Brownlee also stated that people do not always view displays at a constant distance, and claimed a close-viewed display could no longer be classed as Retina. However, near visual acuity is usually poor due to presbyopia in nearly everyone over 40, such that decreasing reading distance can actually reduce perceivable resolution.

 The Eye is the organ of sight. Eyes enable people to perform daily tasks and to learn about the world that surrounds them. Sight, or vision, is a rapidly occurring process that involves continuous interaction between the eye, the nervous system, and the brain. When someone looks at an object, what he/she is really seeing is the light that the object reflects, or gives off. This reflected light passes through the lens and falls on to the retina of the eye. Here, the light induces nerve impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain, where it makes an image of the object, and then that image is passed on to muscles and glands.The eye is well protected. It lies within a bony socket of the skull. The eyelids guard it in front. They blink an average of once every six seconds. This washes the eye with the salty secretion from the tear, or lachrymal, glands. Each tear gland is about the size and shape of an almond. These glands are located behind the upper eyelid at the outer corner of the eye. After passing over the eye, the liquid from the gland is drained into the nose through the tear duct at the inner corner of the eye.Heavy laughter or crying causes muscles in the upper eyelid to squeeze the lachrymal gland. This produces tears that flow too fast to be drained away. The eyelashes catch many flying particles that otherwise would enter the eye. As further protection, the eyelids automatically close when an object suddenly moves close to the eye.Parts Of the EyeThe eye is made of 3 coats, or tunics. The outermost coat consists of the cornea and the sclera. The middle coat contains the main blood supply to the eye and consists of the choroid, the ciliary body, and the Iris. The innermost layer is the retina.Cornea and ScleraThe Sclera, or the white of the eye, is composed of tough fibrous tissue. On the exposed area of the eye the scleral surface is covered with a mucous membrane called the conjunctiva. This protects the eye from becoming dry.The Cornea, a part of the sclera, is the transparent window of the eye through which light passes. The focusing of the light begins in the cornea.Behind the Cornea is a watery fluid called the aqueous humor. This fluid fills a curved, crescent shaped space, thick in the center and thinner toward the edges. The cornea and the aqueous humor together make an outer lens that refracts, or bends, light and directs it toward the center of the eye.IrisBehind the aqueous humor is a colored ring called the iris. The color of the iris is inherited and does not affect vision. The iris is like a muscular curtain that opens and closes. It controls the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening in the iris. The pupil looks like a black spot. Light from everything a person sees must go through the pupil. When more or less light is needed to see better, the pupil becomes larger or smaller through the movement of the muscle in the iris. The aqueous humor flows through the pupil into a small space between the iris and the lens.A simple way to see how the pupils respond to light is to stand in front of a mirror with your eyes closed, covered by your hands for about 10 seconds. When your hands are removed and your eyes open, the pupils begin to get smaller, or contract, in response to the light. When the light is reduced, your pupils expand; when it is increased, they contract.The choroid is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue squeezed between the sclera and the retina. It supplies nutrients to the eye. The ciliary body is a muscular structure that changes the shape of the lens.LensBehind the pupil and iris are the crystalline lens and the ciliary muscle. The muscle holds the lens in place and changes its shape. The lens is a colorless, nearly transparent double convex structure, similar to an ordinary magnifying glass. Its only function is to focus light rays onto the retina. The lens is made of elongated cells that have no blood supply. These cells obtain nutrients from the surrounding fluids – the aqueous humor in front and the vitreous body, a clear jelly, behind.The shape of the lens – essentially that of a flattened globe – can be changed by the movement of the ciliary muscles surrounding it. Therefore, the eye can focus clearly on objects at widely varying distances. The ability of the lens to adjust from a distant and a near focus is called accommodation. By contracting, the ciliary muscle pushes the lens to make it thicker in the middle. By relaxing, the muscle pulls the lens and flattens it. To see objects clearly when they are close to the eyes the lens is squeezed together and thickened. To see distant objects clearly it is flattened. For people with normal vision, the relaxed ciliary muscle flattens the lens enough to bring objects into sharp focus if they are 20 feet or more from the eye. To see closer objects clearly, the ciliary muscle must contract in order to thicken the lens. Young children can see objects clearly at distances as close as 2 1/2 inches. After about age 45 most people must have objects farther and farther away in order to see them clearly. The lens becomes less elastic as a person grows older.RetinaThe retina is a soft, transparent layer of nervous tissue made up of millions of light receptors. The retina is connected to the brain by the optic nerve. All of the structures needed to focus light onto the retina and to nourish it are housed in the eye, which is primarily a supporting shell for the retina.When light enters the eye it passes through the lens and focuses an image onto the retina. The retina has several layers, one of which contains special cells named for their shapes – rods and cones. Light sensitive chemicals in the rods and cones react to specific wavelengths of light and trigger nerve impulses. These impulses are carried through the optic nerve to the visual center in the brain. Here, they are interpreted, and sight occurs.Light must pass through the covering layers of the retina to reach the layer of rods and cones. There are about 75 to 150 million cones in the human retina. Rods do not detect lines, points, or color. They perceive only light and dark tones in an image. The sensitive rods can determine outlines of objects in almost complete darkness. They make it possible for people to see in darkness or at night. Cones are the keenest of the retina’s receptor cells. They detect the fine lines and points of an image. The cones, for example, make it possible to read these words. There are three types of cones that receive color sensations. One type absorbs light best in wavelengths of blue-violet and another in wavelengths of green; a third is sensitive to wavelengths of yellow and red.How Two Eyes Can Work TogetherMost individuals use both eyes to see an object. This type of sensory perception is known as binocular vision. Thus, two images of the object are formed – one of the retina of each eye. Impulses from both images are sent to the brain. Through experience these impulses are interpreted as two views of the same object. Because the eyes are about 2 1/2 inches apart from pupil to pupil and therefore are looking at the object from different angles, the 2 views are not exactly alike. This is known as the stereoscopic effect. If the object is far away, the difference between the images is slight. If it is a few inches away, the difference is very great. The brain makes good use of the phenomenon. It learns to judge the distance of an object by the degree of difference between the images it receives from the two eyes. In the same way, the brain perceives what is called perspective. It estimates differences in distance between two different objects or between two parts of the same object. The eyes are turned up, down and sideways by long muscles. At one end these muscles are attached to the bony walls of the eye socket. They are regulated with the most delicate precision so that normally they turn both eyes toward the same object at exactly the same time.Organic DisordersThe conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inner surface of the eyelids and the exposed surface of the sclera, can become irritated and inflamed. This is called conjunctivitis, and is caused by viral infections or by exposure to smoke, dust, or similar irritants. A common disorder of the eyelid, particularly in children, is a sty – an infection in the small glands of the eyelash. It is caused by the growth of bacteria and results in reddening and swelling of the entire eyelid.A cataract is a cloudy discoloration in the lens of the eye. It can develop until the entire lens is covered with a thin, milky film. Treatment for cataract usually involves surgery, after which the patient is fitted with special glasses.Glaucoma is a fairly common disorder caused by an increase in pressure within the eyeball. It can result from heredity, tumors, and other causes. Headache, blurred vision, and eye pain are symptoms of glaucoma. Many treatments are used, and it is sometimes necessary to perform surgery to relieve the pressure.Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited eye disease in which the retinal pigments degenerate. In the course of the disease, the rods are destroyed early, causing night blindness in youth. Deterioration of the retina is progressive. Eventually the affected person sees objects as if looking through a narrow pipe. This stage is followed by complete blindness.Diabetes, treated or untreated, may cause serious eye complications. The most common condition occurs in people who have had the disease for a long time. The blood vessels of the retina expand and bleed into the retina. In later stages the bleeding becomes more extensive and eventually the retina becomes detached. These changes invariably lead to blindness. The actual cause of the changes in vessels of the retina is still unknown.Both benign and malignant eye tumors are usually extremely serious. They not only damage the eye but may also invade the brain.Optical DefectsSome eyes are abnormally long from front to back. The lens, even when stretched to the utmost, cannot bring distant objects to a focus on the retina. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the result. This defect is corrected by wearing a concave, or negative, spectacle lens. This lens, together with the convex lens of the eye, makes an optical system of longer focus.When the distance between the front and the back of the eye is too short, the lens cannot bring near objects to a focus. This is a form of farsightedness called hypermetropia. The condition is corrected by shortening the focus with a convex or positive lens.In many eyes the cornea is deformed so that its surface is oval instead of spherical. Light rays are distorted at the entrance of the eye. This produces a blurred image and is known as astigmatism. To correct it, glasses are given a nonspherical or cylindrical curvature. Cross-eyes and walleyes are produced when both eyes do not work together because of weakness of the eye muscles. The images formed on the two retinas are so unlike that they cannot be blended in the brain. Thus, a double image is perceived. The condition is known as diplopia, or double vision. Prismatic lenses are prescribed to correct this defect.Imperfections in the cones of the retina, resulting from heredity or disease, cause defective color vision. This is known as color blindness, or Daltonism. In total color blindness, everything appears in shades of gray. In its more common from, color blindness is the inability to distinguish between reds and greens.Persistent headaches, blurred vision, and painful inflammation of the eyelids are symptoms that may indicate serious eye disorders. Particles lodged in the eye should be removed without delay. Glasses are prescribed to strengthen vision and to reduce strain and fatigue.

 The eye is a very complex organ with an incredibly important function. Each part of the eye plays a special role in the visual process that allows us to see. An abnormality in any part of this complex system can lead to problems with your vision.
The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time.
The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye.
The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera.
Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image.
The anterior chamber is the fluid-filled space in the front of the eye, between the cornea and the iris.
Also known as intraocular fluid, this clear, watery liquid is produced by the ciliary body and flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber. Aqueous humour consists of 99.9% water and 0.1% sugars, vitamins, proteins and other nutrients.
Aqueous humour helps the eye maintain its pressure and provide nutrients to the internal part of the eye. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level.
The choroid is a layer of tissue packed with blood vessels that is located between the sclera and the retina. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished.
Located between the iris and the choroid, the ciliary body helps with holding the lens in position, changing its shape when focusing or accomodating, and producing aqueous humour.
The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation.
This is the clear, thin membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and the white of the eye. It helps to keep the eye moist and lubricated, and protect it from debris and infection. The conjunctiva also contains tiny blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the eye and eyelids.
The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye.
This is the part of the eye at the junction of the iris and cornea. Aqueous humour drains out of the eye via the trabecular meshwork and enters the bloodstream in order to keep the pressure in the eye stable. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle.
This is a small pit-like structure in the central area of the retina, which contains only cone light receptor cells (no rod cells) and provides the sharpest vision.
The iris is the coloured part of the eye that sits behind the cornea. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre).
Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. The lens can change its thickness and curvature to focus on objects at different distances and to make sure that the image is as clear as possible (this process is known as accomodation).
This small and highly sensitive area in the central retina is responsible for seeing fine detail, such as letters and faces.
The optic disc or optic nerve head is the circular area on the retina where the optic nerve enters the eye.
The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibres that carries electrical messages from the retina to the brain for processing.
The posterior chamber is the area of the eye behind the lens and in front of the retina. It is filled with the vitreous humour, a clear gel.
The pupil is the dark, round area in the centre of the iris, which is actually an opening. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The pupil gets larger (dilates) when exposed to low-light conditions, such as those experienced at night, and gets smaller (constricts) in bright light.
The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Rods process light in low-light conditions, while cones process light in well-lit conditions and can see colour. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The retina turns the light-ray activity (‘picture’) into an electrical message, which is sent via the optic nerve to the brain for decoding.
The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The sclera also continues around to the back of the eye and the optic disc. Consisting of thick connective tissue, it forms the supporting wall of the eye and protects its internal structures.
These are small glands inside the upper eyelid, which produce the majority of our tears. Tears help to keep the surface of the eye moist and lubricated, provide oxygen and nutrition to the surface of the eye, protect the eye from damage, clear away foreign objects and help to prevent infection. The nasolacrimal duct on the inner eyelids helps to drain tears away from the eye.
The collective name given to the iris, the choroid and the ciliary body.
The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. It consists of 99% water and 1% collagen, proteins, salts and sugars. Although mostly water, this fluid has a firm, jelly-like consistency.
The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away.

 Only part of the eye is visible in a person's face. The whole eye — the eyeball — is about the size and shape of a ping-pong ball.
All parts of the eye are extremely delicate, so our bodies protect them in several ways. The eyeball sits in the eye socket (also called the orbit) in the skull, where it is surrounded by bone. The visible part of the eye is protected by the eyelids and the eyelashes, which keep dirt, dust, and even harmful bright light out of the eye.
Eyes are also protected by tears, which moisten them and clean out dirt, dust, and other irritants that get past the defenses of the eyelashes and eyelids. Tears also help protect against infection.
With each blink, our eyelids spread a layer of mucus, oil, and tears over the cornea, which covers the eye. The lacrimal glands in the upper outer corner of each eye socket produce tears, which, after moistening the eyes, flow into canals in the eyelids. These canals drain into the lacrimal sac, a pouch in the lower inner corner of each eye socket. Tears then exit through a passage that leads to the nose.
To see, the eye has to move. Six extraocular muscles surround the eyeball and act like the strings on a puppet, moving the eye in different directions. The muscles of each eye normally move together at the same time, allowing the two eyes to remain aligned.
The sclera is the outermost protective layer. This tough, fibrous tissue surrounds the eyeball and attaches to the cornea, which is the clear front surface of the eye. What we see as the white of the eye is the sclera. Over the sclera lies the conjunctiva, a clear skin layer that protects the eye from becoming dry.
The choroid is the middle layer that contains blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the inside parts of the eye.
The retina, the innermost of the three layers, lines the inside of the eyeball. The retina is a soft, light-sensitive layer of nervous system tissue. The optic nerve carries signals from the retina to the brain, which interprets them as visual images.
The space in the center of the eyeball is filled with a clear jelly-like material called the vitreous humor. This material allows light to pass through to the retina. It also helps the eye keep its round shape.
Vision is the process by which images captured by the eye are interpreted by the brain, and the visible part of the eye is where the process of sight begins. On the front surface of the eye is the see-through, circle-shaped cornea. You can't see a person's cornea the way you can see the colored part of the eye behind it — the cornea is like a clear window that focuses light into the eye.
Behind the cornea is a watery fluid called the aqueous humor. The cornea and aqueous humor form an outer lens that refracts (bends) light on its way into the eye. This is where most of the eye's focusing work is done.
The colored circular membrane in the eye just behind the cornea is called the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, which is the opening in the center of the iris that looks like a tiny black circle.
Like a camera, which controls the amount of light coming in to prevent both overexposure and underexposure, the iris becomes wider and narrower, changing the size of the pupil to control the amount of light entering the eye. The pupil gets bigger when more light is needed to see better and smaller when there's plenty of light.
The eye's lens sits just behind the iris. Just like a camera lens, the eye's lens focuses light to form sharp, clear images. Light that has been focused through the cornea and aqueous humor hits the lens, which then focuses it further, sending the light rays through the vitreous humor and onto the retina.
To focus on objects clearly at varying distances, the eye's lens needs to change shape. The ciliary body contains the muscular structure in the eye that changes the shape of the eye's lens. In people who have normal vision, the ciliary body flattens the lens enough to bring objects into focus at a distance of 20 feet or more. To see closer objects, this muscle contracts to thicken the lens. Young children can see objects at very close range; many people over 45 have to hold objects farther and farther away to see them clearly. This is because the lens becomes less elastic with age.
The retina (the soft, light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back of the eyeball wall) is made up of millions of light receptors called rods and cones. Rods are much more sensitive to light than cones. Each eye has about 125 million rods that help us see in dim light and detect shades of gray, but they cannot distinguish colors. In comparison, the 6 million cones in each eye allow us to see in bright light and they also sense color and detail.
The macula is a small, specialized area on the retina that helps the eyes see fine details when we look directly at an object. It contains mainly cones and few rods.
When focused light is projected onto the retina, it stimulates the rods and cones. The retina then sends nerve signals are sent through the back of the eye to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries these signals to the brain, which interprets them as visual images. The portion of the brain that processes visual input and interprets the messages that the eye sends is called the visual cortex.
As in a camera, the eye's lens transmits light patterns upside down. The brain learns that the impulses received from the upper part of the retina are really from the lower part of the object we're seeing and vice versa.
Most people use both eyes to see an object. This is called binocular vision, and images are formed on the retina of each eye. These images are slightly different because the object is being viewed from slightly different angles. Nerve signals representing each image are sent to the brain, where they are interpreted as two views of the same object. Some of the nerve fibers from each eye cross, so each side of the brain receives messages from both eyes. Through experience, the brain learns to judge the distance of an object by the degree of difference in the images it receives from the two eyes. This ability to sense distance is called depth perception.
Vision is a fine-tuned process. All the parts of the eye — and the brain — need to work together so a person can see correctly. Because the eye's structure is so complex, though, a lot of things can go wrong.
Some of the most common eye problems are refractive errors. These are the problems that eye doctors check for routinely in a vision test. Refraction means bending of light rays to focus the light coming from an image. Refractive errors are problems with the focusing of the eye, because of the way the eye is shaped, which causes the image you see to be blurred.
Astigmatism. In astigmatism, there's a problem with the curve of the cornea. This causes part of the eye's image to be blurry. Corrective lenses such as contact lenses or glasses can usually correct vision in people with astigmatism.
Myopia. Also called nearsightedness or shortsightedness, myopia happens when the eye focuses the image of an object in front of the retina instead of directly on it. In most cases, people can't see well far away, but can see objects clearly close up. The condition tends to get somewhat worse through childhood and adolescence, but stabilizes in adulthood. People with this condition may need to wear glasses or contacts to correct their vision. Laser eye surgery is now commonly used in adults to correct nearsightedness permanently by changing the shape of the cornea. Laser surgery is not used for teens because the eye may still be growing and the refractive error changing.
Hyperopia. Also called farsightedness or longsightedness, hyperopia happens when the incoming image is not focused on the retina, but behind it. This may make it difficult to see close objects clearly, with far-off objects seen more easily. Many younger children are hyperopic, but because of the ability of the eye to focus itself, may not need glasses to correct this. Glasses or contact lenses can correct this problem in kids and teens when needed. Most adults develop a form of farsightedness called presbyopia as they get older.
Blindness. This is the loss of useful sight. Blindness can be temporary or permanent and it has many causes. Birth defects or damage to any portion of the eye, the optic nerve, or the area of the brain responsible for vision can lead to blindness. The visual impairment cannot be corrected with surgery or corrective lenses, and the condition can make it difficult to perform everyday activities. Diabetes, problems with the macula, and eye changes because of aging account for most blindness in adults in the United States. In children and teenagers, eye injuries and eye trauma account for most blindness.
Cataracts. Some children are born with cataracts, a cloudiness of the eye's lenses that prevent images from being seen clearly or at all. But cataracts are much more prevalent in the elderly among whom surgery to remove cataracts and correct vision is common. In infants and young children, cataracts must be treated early to prevent permanent problems with development of vision.
Color blindness. Color blindness is caused by problems in the pigments of the cones in the retina. Most people who are color-blind can see some colors. In most cases, someone who is color-blind confuses some colors with others, usually red and green. People can be born color-blind or they may develop the condition over time. The most common form of color blindness is an inherited condition that affects boys much more often than girls. Color blindness cannot be corrected.
Dacryostenosis. Dacryostenosis is a blockage of the tear drainage system of the eye happening in the lower eyelid. This is a fairly common problem in infants, but often improves with time.
Eye injuries. Injuries to the eye are one of the most common preventable causes of blindness. Eye injuries may be caused by irritants such as sand, dirt, or other foreign bodies on the eye's surface. Chemicals or foreign bodies that become embedded in the eye can also cause pain and loss of vision. Forceful blows to the eye can cause bleeding inside the eye and damage to the cornea, retina, and other important eye structures.
Glaucoma. One of the leading causes of blindness in the United States, glaucoma is a disorder that causes fluid pressure to build up inside the eye, potentially causing damage to the optic nerve. Although it can happen in infants and children, it is much more common among older adults. Unless detected early by routine screening tests, it usually goes undiagnosed until some vision is lost.
Macular degeneration is an eye disease that mainly affects older people. When someone has macular degeneration, the middle area of the retina becomes scarred. This causes eyesight to deteriorate over many years. The cause of macular degeneration is unknown in most cases, but it tends to run in families, which indicates that genes and heredity are involved.
Pinkeye (conjunctivitis). Pinkeye is a common contagious infection that causes inflammation (redness, pain, and swelling) of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. The eyes become pinkish red and watery, and pus may form. Pinkeye is usually treated with eye drops. Conjunctivitis also can be the result of allergies or from a scratch on the surface of the eye.
Retinoblastoma. This is a cancerous tumor in the eye that usually appears in the first 5 years of life. There may be permanent vision loss, and the affected eye(s) may have to be removed. If not properly treated, this cancer can be life-threatening.
Retinopathy of prematurity. Premature babies sometimes have damage to the blood vessels in the eye's retina, a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity, which can lead to severe vision loss in some cases.
Strabismus. A condition in which the eyes appear misaligned, strabismus is usually caused by a defect in the balance of the pull exerted by the muscles that help the eyes stay straight and move together properly. Surgery on the eye muscles can help realign the eyes. Permanent vision loss in the less-used eye (amblyopia) can happen if the condition is not treated in early childhood.
Stye. A stye (or sty, also called a hordeolum) is a red, painful bump on the eyelid caused by a backed-up oil gland. Styes are treated by applying warm compresses to allow them to drain. Sometimes antibiotic drops or ointments are necessary if it gets infected. Occasionally, a doctor may need to make a tiny cut in the eyelid to let out the clogged-up material.
Proper care of your child's eyes includes having periodic eye exams at routine office checkups and by an eye specialist according to the schedule recommended by your doctor. Signs that a very young child may be having vision trouble include crossing or drifting of one or both eyes, constant eye rubbing, tearing or redness, and trouble following an object. Older kids may squint or sit too close to the TV or have difficulty seeing the board at school.

 1 -4.99580  If one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°. Thus they have the same retinal image size which determines the size of the retinal image.
 2 -8.18228  Visual acuity is the eyes ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a "person of normal vision" at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is used in countries using the metric system, and that represents the distance in metres. This is often measured with a Snellen chart or LogMAR chart
 3 -10.97513 The Eye is the organ of sight. Eyes enable people to perform daily tasks and to learn about the world that surrounds them. Sight, or vision, is a rapidly occurring process that involves continuous interaction between the eye, the nervous system, and the brain. When someone looks at an object, what he/she is really seeing is the light that the object reflects, or gives off. This reflected light passes through the lens and falls on to the retina of the eye. Here, the light induces nerve impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain, where it makes an image of the object, and then that image is passed on to muscles and glands.The eye is well protected. It lies within a bony socket of the skull. The eyelids guard it in front. They blink an average of once every six seconds. This washes the eye with the salty secretion from the tear, or lachrymal, glands. Each tear gland is about the size and shape of an almond. These glands are located behind the upper eyelid at the outer corner of the eye. After passing over the eye, the liquid from the gland is drained into the nose through the tear duct at the inner corner of the eye.Heavy laughter or crying causes muscles in the upper eyelid to squeeze the lachrymal gland. This produces tears that flow too fast to be drained away. The eyelashes catch many flying particles that otherwise would enter the eye. As further protection, the eyelids automatically close when an object suddenly moves close to the eye.Parts Of the EyeThe eye is made of 3 coats, or tunics. The outermost coat consists of the cornea and the sclera. The middle coat contains the main blood supply to the eye and consists of the choroid, the ciliary body, and the Iris. The innermost layer is the retina.Cornea and ScleraThe Sclera, or the white of the eye, is composed of tough fibrous tissue. On the exposed area of the eye the scleral surface is covered with a mucous membrane called the conjunctiva. This protects the eye from becoming dry.The Cornea, a part of the sclera, is the transparent window of the eye through which light passes. The focusing of the light begins in the cornea.Behind the Cornea is a watery fluid called the aqueous humor. This fluid fills a curved, crescent shaped space, thick in the center and thinner toward the edges. The cornea and the aqueous humor together make an outer lens that refracts, or bends, light and directs it toward the center of the eye.IrisBehind the aqueous humor is a colored ring called the iris. The color of the iris is inherited and does not affect vision. The iris is like a muscular curtain that opens and closes. It controls the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening in the iris. The pupil looks like a black spot. Light from everything a person sees must go through the pupil. When more or less light is needed to see better, the pupil becomes larger or smaller through the movement of the muscle in the iris. The aqueous humor flows through the pupil into a small space between the iris and the lens.A simple way to see how the pupils respond to light is to stand in front of a mirror with your eyes closed, covered by your hands for about 10 seconds. When your hands are removed and your eyes open, the pupils begin to get smaller, or contract, in response to the light. When the light is reduced, your pupils expand; when it is increased, they contract.The choroid is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue squeezed between the sclera and the retina. It supplies nutrients to the eye. The ciliary body is a muscular structure that changes the shape of the lens.LensBehind the pupil and iris are the crystalline lens and the ciliary muscle. The muscle holds the lens in place and changes its shape. The lens is a colorless, nearly transparent double convex structure, similar to an ordinary magnifying glass. Its only function is to focus light rays onto the retina. The lens is made of elongated cells that have no blood supply. These cells obtain nutrients from the surrounding fluids – the aqueous humor in front and the vitreous body, a clear jelly, behind.The shape of the lens – essentially that of a flattened globe – can be changed by the movement of the ciliary muscles surrounding it. Therefore, the eye can focus clearly on objects at widely varying distances. The ability of the lens to adjust from a distant and a near focus is called accommodation. By contracting, the ciliary muscle pushes the lens to make it thicker in the middle. By relaxing, the muscle pulls the lens and flattens it. To see objects clearly when they are close to the eyes the lens is squeezed together and thickened. To see distant objects clearly it is flattened. For people with normal vision, the relaxed ciliary muscle flattens the lens enough to bring objects into sharp focus if they are 20 feet or more from the eye. To see closer objects clearly, the ciliary muscle must contract in order to thicken the lens. Young children can see objects clearly at distances as close as 2 1/2 inches. After about age 45 most people must have objects farther and farther away in order to see them clearly. The lens becomes less elastic as a person grows older.RetinaThe retina is a soft, transparent layer of nervous tissue made up of millions of light receptors. The retina is connected to the brain by the optic nerve. All of the structures needed to focus light onto the retina and to nourish it are housed in the eye, which is primarily a supporting shell for the retina.When light enters the eye it passes through the lens and focuses an image onto the retina. The retina has several layers, one of which contains special cells named for their shapes – rods and cones. Light sensitive chemicals in the rods and cones react to specific wavelengths of light and trigger nerve impulses. These impulses are carried through the optic nerve to the visual center in the brain. Here, they are interpreted, and sight occurs.Light must pass through the covering layers of the retina to reach the layer of rods and cones. There are about 75 to 150 million cones in the human retina. Rods do not detect lines, points, or color. They perceive only light and dark tones in an image. The sensitive rods can determine outlines of objects in almost complete darkness. They make it possible for people to see in darkness or at night. Cones are the keenest of the retina’s receptor cells. They detect the fine lines and points of an image. The cones, for example, make it possible to read these words. There are three types of cones that receive color sensations. One type absorbs light best in wavelengths of blue-violet and another in wavelengths of green; a third is sensitive to wavelengths of yellow and red.How Two Eyes Can Work TogetherMost individuals use both eyes to see an object. This type of sensory perception is known as binocular vision. Thus, two images of the object are formed – one of the retina of each eye. Impulses from both images are sent to the brain. Through experience these impulses are interpreted as two views of the same object. Because the eyes are about 2 1/2 inches apart from pupil to pupil and therefore are looking at the object from different angles, the 2 views are not exactly alike. This is known as the stereoscopic effect. If the object is far away, the difference between the images is slight. If it is a few inches away, the difference is very great. The brain makes good use of the phenomenon. It learns to judge the distance of an object by the degree of difference between the images it receives from the two eyes. In the same way, the brain perceives what is called perspective. It estimates differences in distance between two different objects or between two parts of the same object. The eyes are turned up, down and sideways by long muscles. At one end these muscles are attached to the bony walls of the eye socket. They are regulated with the most delicate precision so that normally they turn both eyes toward the same object at exactly the same time.Organic DisordersThe conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inner surface of the eyelids and the exposed surface of the sclera, can become irritated and inflamed. This is called conjunctivitis, and is caused by viral infections or by exposure to smoke, dust, or similar irritants. A common disorder of the eyelid, particularly in children, is a sty – an infection in the small glands of the eyelash. It is caused by the growth of bacteria and results in reddening and swelling of the entire eyelid.A cataract is a cloudy discoloration in the lens of the eye. It can develop until the entire lens is covered with a thin, milky film. Treatment for cataract usually involves surgery, after which the patient is fitted with special glasses.Glaucoma is a fairly common disorder caused by an increase in pressure within the eyeball. It can result from heredity, tumors, and other causes. Headache, blurred vision, and eye pain are symptoms of glaucoma. Many treatments are used, and it is sometimes necessary to perform surgery to relieve the pressure.Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited eye disease in which the retinal pigments degenerate. In the course of the disease, the rods are destroyed early, causing night blindness in youth. Deterioration of the retina is progressive. Eventually the affected person sees objects as if looking through a narrow pipe. This stage is followed by complete blindness.Diabetes, treated or untreated, may cause serious eye complications. The most common condition occurs in people who have had the disease for a long time. The blood vessels of the retina expand and bleed into the retina. In later stages the bleeding becomes more extensive and eventually the retina becomes detached. These changes invariably lead to blindness. The actual cause of the changes in vessels of the retina is still unknown.Both benign and malignant eye tumors are usually extremely serious. They not only damage the eye but may also invade the brain.Optical DefectsSome eyes are abnormally long from front to back. The lens, even when stretched to the utmost, cannot bring distant objects to a focus on the retina. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the result. This defect is corrected by wearing a concave, or negative, spectacle lens. This lens, together with the convex lens of the eye, makes an optical system of longer focus.When the distance between the front and the back of the eye is too short, the lens cannot bring near objects to a focus. This is a form of farsightedness called hypermetropia. The condition is corrected by shortening the focus with a convex or positive lens.In many eyes the cornea is deformed so that its surface is oval instead of spherical. Light rays are distorted at the entrance of the eye. This produces a blurred image and is known as astigmatism. To correct it, glasses are given a nonspherical or cylindrical curvature. Cross-eyes and walleyes are produced when both eyes do not work together because of weakness of the eye muscles. The images formed on the two retinas are so unlike that they cannot be blended in the brain. Thus, a double image is perceived. The condition is known as diplopia, or double vision. Prismatic lenses are prescribed to correct this defect.Imperfections in the cones of the retina, resulting from heredity or disease, cause defective color vision. This is known as color blindness, or Daltonism. In total color blindness, everything appears in shades of gray. In its more common from, color blindness is the inability to distinguish between reds and greens.Persistent headaches, blurred vision, and painful inflammation of the eyelids are symptoms that may indicate serious eye disorders. Particles lodged in the eye should be removed without delay. Glasses are prescribed to strengthen vision and to reduce strain and fatigue.
 4 -11.02804  human eye can perceive." Apple fan website CultOfMac hosts an article by John Brownlee who incorrectly stated that the resolution the human eye can discern at 12 inches is 900 PPI, concluding "Apple's Retina Displays are only about 33% of the way there." On the topic of 20/20 vision, Brownlee misrepresented visual acuity in the population saying "most research suggests that normal vision is actually much better than 20/20" when in truth the majority have worse than 20/20 vision, and the WHO considers average vision as 20/40. Brownlee also stated that people do not always view displays at a constant distance, and claimed a close-viewed display could no longer be classed as Retina. However, near visual acuity is usually poor due to presbyopia in nearly everyone over 40, such that decreasing reading distance can actually reduce perceivable resolution.
 5 -11.14588  Knapp's Rule states that lenses placed at the anterior focal point of the eye, generally 15 mm in front of the eye, will create similarly sized images on the retina, whenever the disparity between the two eyes is due to a difference in axial length of the eyes. When a refractive error is corrected with spectacle lenses, the retinal images change size. It is magnified with convex lenses and minified with concave lenses. One difficulty, then, in prescribing glasses to an individual with a disparity in refractive error between the two eyes is that a disparity in image size between the two eyes may be created. There is some controversy as to the soundness of Knapp's Rule.

['When a warm substance comes into contact with a cold object, the warm substance will cool down. This is because the warm substance is losing heat to the cold object. The heat is transferred from the warm substance to the cold object through conduction. The cold object absorbs the heat and becomes warmer, while the warm substance becomes cooler. This process continues until the warm substance and the cold object reach thermal equilibrium, at which point they are both at the same temperature.\n\nIn this scenario, the warm substance is losing heat, which means it is cooling down. Therefore, the substance that will cool when it touches a cold object is a warm substance.\n\nExamples of warm substances that will cool when they touch a cold object include a hot cup of coffee touching a cold countertop, or a warm metal spoon touching a cold bowl of ice cream.\n\nIn contrast, if a cold substance touches a hot object, the cold substance will heat up. This is because the cold substance is gaining heat from the hot object. The hot object is losing heat, which means it is cooling down. This process continues until the cold substance and the hot object reach thermal equilibrium.\n\nExamples of cold substances that will heat up when they touch a hot object include a cold metal spoon touching a hot pot of soup, or a cold glass touching a hot stove.\n\nIn summary, when a warm substance touches a cold object, the warm substance will cool down.

  Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid. (See heat death of the universe.) Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites.

  The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals

  the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process. Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of gas is reduced, the gas in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pileus or lenticular

  the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it. Adiabatic heating occurs in the Earth's atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Because of this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly

   A phase change material (PCM) is a substance which releases/absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heat/cooling. Generally the transition will be from one of the first two fundamental states of matter - solid and liquid - to the other. The phase transition may also be between non-classical states of matter, such as the conformity of crystals, where the material goes from conforming to one crystalline structure to conforming to another, which may be a higher or lower energy state. The energy released/absorbed by phase transition from solid to liquid, or vice versa, the heat of fusion is generally much higher than the sensible heat. Ice, for example, requires

  Shaving cream is an example of a complex fluid. Without stress, the foam appears to be a solid: it does not flow and can support (very) light loads. However, when adequate stress is applied, shaving cream flows easily like a fluid. On the level of individual bubbles, the flow is due to rearrangements of small collections of bubbles. On this scale, the flow is not smooth, but instead consists of fluctuations due to rearrangements of the bubbles and releases of stress. These fluctuations are similar to the fluctuations that are studied in earthquakes.

  In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient "adiabatic approximation". For example, the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings. In meteorology and oceanography, adiabatic cooling produces condensation of moisture or salinity, oversaturating the parcel. Therefore, the excess must be removed. There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated.

 Heat loss from the body primarily depends on the environmental temperature. When the surrounding temperature is lower than the body's core temperature, the body loses heat to the environment. This occurs through several processes, including conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. 

Conduction refers to the transfer of heat between objects that are in direct contact. For example, when you touch a cold surface, heat is transferred from your body to the object. Convection involves the transfer of heat through the movement of air or fluids. Warm air currents near the body rise while cooler air descends, promoting heat loss. 

Radiation refers to the emission of infrared heat radiation from the body's surface to the surrounding environment. The rate of radiation varies depending on the temperature difference between the body and the environment. Lastly, evaporation, most notably through sweating, leads to heat loss. As sweat evaporates from the skin, it carries away heat from the body, helping to cool it down.

It is important to note that individuals can regulate their body temperature through mechanisms like vasoconstriction and shivering, which help conserve heat when exposed to cold temperatures. On the other hand, vasodilation and sweating aid in dissipating heat when the surrounding environment is warmer. However, regardless of these physiological processes, the main factor determining heat loss from the body is the environmental temperature.

 The side of each tube is applied successively to the skin for a few seconds and the patient is asked to report whether the flask feels “less hot” or “less cold” in comparison to a normal part.The use of warm and cool water from a tap is adequate and more practical for this purpose.If an area of diminished or absent touch or pain sensation is encountered, its boundaries should be demarcated to determine whether it has a segmental or peripheral nerve distribution, or is lost below a certain level on the trunk. As mentioned, such areas are best delineated by proceeding from the region of impaired sensation toward the normal. The changes may be confirmed by dragging a pin lightly over the parts in question. Areas of reduced pinprick sensation can be corroborated by the thermal sense examination, as below. Testing of Thermal Sense

A quick but rough way to assess thermal loss (or to corroborate a previously found zone of hypalgesia) is to warm one side of a tuning fork by rubbing it briskly against the palm and apply its alternate sides to the patient’s skin and asking the patient which side is colder (or warmer). One advantage of this mode of testing is that it offers the patient a binary choice of “warm” or “cold” response. This suffices for most bedside examinations. If more careful examination is required, the skin should first be exposed to room air for a brief time. The test objects should be large, ideally two stoppered test tubes containing hot (45°C/113°F) and cold (20°C/68°F) tap water. The use of warm and cool water from a tap is adequate and more practical for this purpose. The side of each tube is applied successively to the skin for a few seconds and the patient is asked to report whether the flask feels “less hot” or “less cold” in comparison to a normal part.If the temperature of the test object is below 10°C (50°F) or above 50°C (122°F), sensations of cold or heat become confused with pain.This technique has been largely supplanted by commercial devices that can present a series of slightly differing thermal stimuli in sequence to a probe placed on the finger or toe.

['In the natural world, worms play a crucial role in the process of decomposition. These small, segmented creatures are known as "earthworms," and they are found in soil all over the world. Earthworms are not insects, but rather members of the phylum Annelida, which also includes leeches and segmented worms that live in water.\n\nEarthworms are important decomposers because they help to break down organic matter, such as dead plant and animal material, and return nutrients to the soil. This process is known as "recycling." Earthworms are able to do this because they have a unique digestive system.\n\nWhen an earthworm eats, it does not chew its food. Instead, it swallows the organic matter whole, and it passes through the worm\'s body in a process called "gut passage." The food is broken down by enzymes in the worm\'s gut, and the nutrients are absorbed through the worm\'s body wall.\n\nThe undigested material, along with any waste products, is then excreted through the worm\'s cloaca, which is a common opening for the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems.

  A mole's diet primarily consists of earthworms and other small invertebrates found in the soil. The mole runs are in reality "worm traps", the mole sensing when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly running along to kill and eat it. Because their saliva contains a toxin that can paralyze earthworms, moles are able to store their still-living prey for later consumption. They construct special underground "larders" for just this purpose; researchers have discovered such larders with over a thousand earthworms in them. Before eating earthworms, moles pull them between their squeezed paws to force the collected earth and dirt out of the worm's gut. The star-nosed mole can detect, catch and eat food faster than the human eye can follow.

  Once ingested by the insect the worm larva penetrates the gut wall and develops in a cyst in the tissue outside. It emerges as an adult worm in a few months. Gordius worms have been recovered from human vomit, feces, and urine. When worms are expelled from the gastrointestinal tract, their mode of entry was likely ingestion of contaminated food or water, or of an infested insect. When present in the urine, the worm may have entered the urethra from the anus or while the victim was swimming in contaminated water. Horsehair worms are not considered pathogenic or parasitic on humans and their presence in the body is incidental. Adult worms, as in some other Nematomorpha genera, may squirm in a tangled ball resembling a Gordian Knot; horsehair worms are also referred to as gordian worms.

  changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the microbiota mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

  Eisenia fetida (older spelling: foetida), known under various common names such as manure worm, redworm, brandling worm, panfish worm, trout worm, tiger worm, red wiggler worm, etc., is a species of earthworm adapted to decaying organic material. These worms thrive in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure. They are epigean, rarely found in soil. In this trait, they resemble Lumbricus rubellus. Red wigglers are reddish-brown in color, have small rings around their body and have a yellowish tail. They have groups of bristles (called setae) on each segment that move in and out to grip nearby surfaces as the worms stretch and

  Through the mycelium, a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment. It does this in a two-stage process. First, the hyphae secrete enzymes onto or into the food source, which break down biological polymers into smaller units such as monomers. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Mycelia are vital in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for their role in the decomposition of plant material. They contribute to the organic fraction of soil, and their growth releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere (see carbon cycle). Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium, as well as the mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, increase the efficiency

  The anus (from Latin anus meaning "ring", "circle") is an opening at the opposite end of an animal's digestive tract from the mouth. Its function is to control the expulsion of feces, the residual semi-solid waste that remains after food digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, includes: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as bones; food material after the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose or lignin; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts. Amphibians, reptiles, and birds use the same orifice (known as the cloaca) for excreting liquid and solid wastes, for copulation and egg-laying. Monotreme mammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest

 According to Casper's dictum, decomposition is known to occur most rapidly in soil environments. Soil acts as a natural medium where organic materials can break down more quickly due to various factors such as microbial activity, moisture, temperature, and the presence of decomposers like bacteria, fungi, insects, and earthworms. These decomposers play a vital role in breaking down complex organic matter such as dead plant materials, animal carcasses, and other organic waste. In soil environments, the decomposition process is facilitated by the efficient nutrient cycling, aeration, and the presence of a diverse range of decomposers. As a result, the organic matter is broken down into simpler compounds, effectively recycling nutrients back into the soil and promoting a healthy ecosystem. So, based on Casper's dictum, it can be concluded that decomposition occurs at its fastest rate in soil environments.

 Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. Mechanical digestion takes place in mouth through mastication and in small intestine through segmentation contractions. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work, and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO−3). About 30% of starch is hydrolyzed into disaccharide in oral cavity(mouth), After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. In infants and toddlers gastric juice also contains rennin to digest milk proteins. As the first two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals like concentrated hydrochloric acid and mucus also helps in lubrication. Hydrochloric acid provides acidic pH for pepsin. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. Pepsin breaks down proteins into peptides or proteoses, which is further broken down into dipeptides and amino acids by enzymes in small intestine. Studies suggest that increasing the number of chews per bite increases relevant gut hormones and may decrease self-reported hunger and food intake.

After some time (typically 1–2 hours in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, 3–4 hours in house cats), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme.  When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.  Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Absorption of water, simple sugar and alcohol also takes place in stomach. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.

Digestive system

Digestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.

Some organisms, including nearly all spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent "soup". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.

Secretion systems

Bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments.

Channel transport system

In a channel transport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20–900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.

Molecular syringe

A type III secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.

Conjugation machinery
The conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system.

The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.

Release of outer membrane vesicles
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.  Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials.  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells.  While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.

Gastrovascular cavity
The gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body.  Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.

In a plant such as the Venus Flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.

Phagosome
A phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis.  The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, Entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells.

Specialised organs and behaviours
To aid in the digestion of their food, animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, radulae, teeth, crops, gizzards, and others.

Beaks
Birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird's ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.

The mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.

Tongue

The tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates, that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.

The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

Teeth

Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.

The shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals' teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat.

Crop
A crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.

Certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus.

Abomasum

Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material.  Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.

Fibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.

The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine.  Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.

Specialised behaviours
Regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.

Many sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).

Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.

In earthworms
An earthworm's digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

Overview of vertebrate digestion

In most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:
 Ingestion: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system),
 Mechanical and chemical breakdown:  mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water, acids, bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures,
 Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis, active transport, and diffusion, and
 Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation.

Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an "overhead charge" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).

The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion.

In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach.  Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches.  The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.

Human digestion process

The human gastrointestinal tract is around 9 meters long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours.

Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus and bicarbonates are secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. Mainly proteins are digested in stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice.  The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. Bile helps in emulsification of fats and also activates lipases.

In the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus.

Neural and biochemical control mechanisms 
Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.

The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.

The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid.  Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1–3.  Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.

The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.

Breakdown into nutrients

Protein digestion
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.  The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens.  For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.  Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.

Fat digestion 

Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine.  The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids.  Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, as well as some undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules.

Carbohydrate digestion

In humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose.  This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.

Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose.  Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine.  Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods.  This is commonly known as lactose intolerance.  Lactose intolerance varies widely by genetic heritage;  more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.

Sucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.

DNA and RNA digestion

DNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.

Non-destructive digestion
Some nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups.  To digest vitamin B12 non-destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes.

After the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF).  These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.

Digestive hormones

There are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years.
 Gastrin – is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.
 Secretin – is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver.  This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme.
 Cholecystokinin (CCK) – is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme.
 Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.
 Motilin – is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.

Significance of pH

Digestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. pH plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.

The stomach's high acidity inhibits the breakdown of carbohydrates within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides non-specific immunity, damaging or eliminating various pathogens.

In the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.

 Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. Mechanical digestion takes place in mouth through mastication and in small intestine through segmentation contractions. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work, and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO−3). About 30% of starch is hydrolyzed into disaccharide in oral cavity(mouth), After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. In infants and toddlers gastric juice also contains rennin to digest milk proteins. As the first two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals like concentrated hydrochloric acid and mucus also helps in lubrication. Hydrochloric acid provides acidic pH for pepsin. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. Pepsin breaks down proteins into peptides or proteoses, which is further broken down into dipeptides and amino acids by enzymes in small intestine. Studies suggest that increasing the number of chews per bite increases relevant gut hormones and may decrease self-reported hunger and food intake.

After some time (typically 1–2 hours in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, 3–4 hours in house cats), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme.  When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.  Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Absorption of water, simple sugar and alcohol also takes place in stomach. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.

Digestive system

Digestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.

Some organisms, including nearly all spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent "soup". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.

Secretion systems

Bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments.

Channel transport system

In a channel transport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20–900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.

Molecular syringe

A type III secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.

Conjugation machinery
The conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system.

The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.

Release of outer membrane vesicles
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.  Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials.  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells.  While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.

Gastrovascular cavity
The gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body.  Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.

In a plant such as the Venus Flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.

Phagosome
A phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis.  The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, Entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells.

Specialised organs and behaviours
To aid in the digestion of their food, animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, radulae, teeth, crops, gizzards, and others.

Beaks
Birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird's ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.

The mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.

Tongue

The tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates, that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.

The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

Teeth

Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.

The shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals' teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat.

Crop
A crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.

Certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus.

Abomasum

Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material.  Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.

Fibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.

The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine.  Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.

Specialised behaviours
Regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.

Many sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).

Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.

In earthworms
An earthworm's digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

Overview of vertebrate digestion

In most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:
 Ingestion: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system),
 Mechanical and chemical breakdown:  mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water, acids, bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures,
 Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis, active transport, and diffusion, and
 Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation.

Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an "overhead charge" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).

The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion.

In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach.  Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches.  The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.

Human digestion process

The human gastrointestinal tract is around 9 meters long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours.

Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus and bicarbonates are secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. Mainly proteins are digested in stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice.  The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. Bile helps in emulsification of fats and also activates lipases.

In the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus.

Neural and biochemical control mechanisms 
Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.

The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.

The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid.  Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1–3.  Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.

The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.

Breakdown into nutrients

Protein digestion
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.  The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens.  For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.  Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.

Fat digestion 

Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine.  The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids.  Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, as well as some undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules.

Carbohydrate digestion

In humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose.  This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.

Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose.  Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine.  Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods.  This is commonly known as lactose intolerance.  Lactose intolerance varies widely by genetic heritage;  more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.

Sucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.

DNA and RNA digestion

DNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.

Non-destructive digestion
Some nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups.  To digest vitamin B12 non-destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes.

After the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF).  These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.

The conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system.

The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.

Release of outer membrane vesicles
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.  Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials.  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells.  While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.

Gastrovascular cavity
The gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body.  Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.

In a plant such as the Venus Flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.

Phagosome
A phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis.  The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, Entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells.

Specialised organs and behaviours
To aid in the digestion of their food, animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, radulae, teeth, crops, gizzards, and others.

Beaks
Birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird's ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.

The mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.

Tongue

The tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates, that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.

The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

Teeth

Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.

The shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals' teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat.

Crop
A crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.

Certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus.

Abomasum

Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material.  Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.

Fibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.

The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine.  Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.

Specialised behaviours
Regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.

Many sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).

Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.

In earthworms
An earthworm's digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.

Overview of vertebrate digestion

In most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:
 Ingestion: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system),
 Mechanical and chemical breakdown:  mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water, acids, bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures,
 Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis, active transport, and diffusion, and
 Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation.

Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an "overhead charge" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).

The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion.

In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach.  Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches.  The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.

Human digestion process

The human gastrointestinal tract is around 9 meters long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours.

Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus and bicarbonates are secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. Mainly proteins are digested in stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice.  The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. Bile helps in emulsification of fats and also activates lipases.

In the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus.

Neural and biochemical control mechanisms 
Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.

The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.

The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid.  Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1–3.  Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.

The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.

Breakdown into nutrients

Protein digestion
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.  The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens.  For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.  Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.

Fat digestion 

Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine.  The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids.  Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, as well as some undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules.

Carbohydrate digestion

In humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose.  This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.

Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose.  Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine.  Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods.  This is commonly known as lactose intolerance.  Lactose intolerance varies widely by genetic heritage;  more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.

Sucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.

DNA and RNA digestion

DNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.

Non-destructive digestion
Some nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups.  To digest vitamin B12 non-destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes.

After the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF).  These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.

Digestive hormones

There are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years.
 Gastrin – is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.
 Secretin – is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver.  This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme.
 Cholecystokinin (CCK) – is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme.
 Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.
 Motilin – is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.

Significance of pH

Digestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. pH plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.

The stomach's high acidity inhibits the breakdown of carbohydrates within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides non-specific immunity, damaging or eliminating various pathogens.

In the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.

 1 -4.95326 According to Casper's dictum, decomposition is known to occur most rapidly in soil environments. Soil acts as a natural medium where organic materials can break down more quickly due to various factors such as microbial activity, moisture, temperature, and the presence of decomposers like bacteria, fungi, insects, and earthworms. These decomposers play a vital role in breaking down complex organic matter such as dead plant materials, animal carcasses, and other organic waste. In soil environments, the decomposition process is facilitated by the efficient nutrient cycling, aeration, and the presence of a diverse range of decomposers. As a result, the organic matter is broken down into simpler compounds, effectively recycling nutrients back into the soil and promoting a healthy ecosystem. So, based on Casper's dictum, it can be concluded that decomposition occurs at its fastest rate in soil environments.

These worms thrive in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure. They are epigean, rarely found in soil. In this trait, they resemble Lumbricus rubellus. Red wigglers are reddish-brown in color, have small rings around their body and have a yellowish tail.

For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

First, the hyphae secrete enzymes onto or into the food source, which break down biological polymers into smaller units such as monomers. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Mycelia are vital in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for their role in the decomposition of plant material. They contribute to the organic fraction of soil, and their growth releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere (see carbon cycle).

When worms are expelled from the gastrointestinal tract, their mode of entry was likely ingestion of contaminated food or water, or of an infested insect. When present in the urine, the worm may have entered the urethra from the anus or while the victim was swimming in contaminated water. Horsehair worms are not considered pathogenic or parasitic on humans and their presence in the body is incidental.

['Photosynthesis is a process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria. It is the process by which these organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. The chemical reaction that occurs during photosynthesis is:\n\n6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis equation shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are the inputs, while glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) are the outputs.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis can be broken down into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by pigments called chlorophylls. This energy is then used to convert ADP and inorganic phosphate into ATP and NADPH. These molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.\n\nThe inputs for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide, water, and light energy.

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use.

In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the Calvin-Benson cycle) is a light-independent reaction that converts carbon dioxide into glucose (fuel). Researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing photocatalysts that are able to perform both of these reactions. Furthermore, the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production. These catalysts must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident

  Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation. Research on this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight.

  The evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is used to assemble sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or electrons, rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.

  In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (Azolla), angiosperms (Gunnera), etc. There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).

 The large amounts of ATP and NADPH required for carbon fixation in the chloroplast are generated through the process of photosynthesis. The thylakoid membranes within the chloroplast contain protein complexes that are responsible for photosynthesis and ATP generation. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membranes, initiating a series of reactions.

In the first stage, known as the light-dependent reactions, light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. This is achieved through a series of electron transport chains and the splitting of water molecules, which releases electrons and produces oxygen as a byproduct. ATP is synthesized through ATP synthase, utilizing the flow of protons across the thylakoid membrane.

The generated ATP and NADPH are then used in the second stage, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic carbon molecules through a series of enzymatic reactions. The enzyme responsible for this process is ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco).

For every 3 molecules of carbon dioxide that enter the Calvin cycle, 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is produced. During this process, 9 molecules of ATP and 6 molecules of NADPH are consumed. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced can then be further utilized in the synthesis of sugars, fats, amino acids, or converted into other metabolites within the plant.

It's important to note that while the production of ATP and NADPH occurs in the chloroplast, additional ATP can also be generated through the breakdown of glucose in the mitochondria via glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. This ATP can be used to power various metabolic reactions within the plant.

In conclusion, the chloroplast generates the large amounts of ATP and NADPH required for carbon fixation through the process of photosynthesis, utilizing the thylakoid membranes and protein complexes to convert light energy into chemical energy.

The cycle was discovered in 1950 by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley by using the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in a cell. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage and transport molecules ATP and NADPH.

 The role of chloroplasts in generating the large amounts of ATP and NADPH required for carbon fixation is essential for photosynthesis. Chloroplasts contain thylakoid membranes that house protein complexes required for photosynthesis and ATP generation. During the process of photosynthesis, chloroplasts convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.

The generation of ATP and NADPH occurs in the thylakoid membranes through chemiosmosis, which is similar to how mitochondria produce ATP. The thylakoid membranes contain protein complexes called photosystems, which consist of chlorophyll molecules and other accessory pigments. These pigments absorb light energy and transfer it to the reaction centers of the photosystems.

In the first stage of photosynthesis, called the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons (H+), and electrons. This process occurs in the thylakoid membranes and generates ATP and NADPH. The energy from the excited electrons is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient. This proton gradient is then utilized by ATP synthase to produce ATP through chemiosmosis.

The NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions is used in the second stage of photosynthesis, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic molecules, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This process requires ATP and NADPH as sources of energy and reducing power, respectively.

Overall, the role of chloroplasts in generating ATP and NADPH is crucial for carbon fixation during photosynthesis. The ATP and NADPH produced in the thylakoid membranes are utilized in the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide into organic molecules, which are essential for plant growth and metabolism.

  Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, can happen even with care, since insulin requirements can change without warning. Some common reasons for hypoglycemia include increased or unplanned exercise, illness, or medication interactions, where another medication potentiates the effects of the insulin. Vomiting and diarrhea episodes can bring on a hypoglycemia reaction, due to dehydration or simply a case of too much insulin and not enough properly digested food. Symptoms of hypoglycemia need to be taken seriously and addressed promptly. Since serious hypoglycemia can be fatal, it is better to treat a suspected incident than to fail to respond quickly to the signs of actual hypoglycemia. Dr. Audrey Cook addressed the issue in her 2007 article on diabetes mellitus: "Hypoglycemia is deadly; hyperglycemia is not. Owners must clearly understand that too much insulin can kill, and that they should call a veterinarian or halve the dose if they have any concerns about a pet's well-being or appetite. Tell owners to offer food immediately if the pet is weak or is behaving strangely."

   Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is treatable and need not shorten the animal's life span or interfere with quality of life. If left untreated, the condition can lead to cataracts, increasing weakness in the legs (neuropathy), malnutrition, ketoacidosis, dehydration, and death. Diabetes mainly affects middle-age and older dogs, but there are juvenile cases. The typical canine diabetes patient is middle-age, female, and overweight at diagnosis. The number of dogs diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has increased three-fold in thirty years. In survival rates from almost the

Trying to make a seizing or unconscious animal swallow can cause choking on the food or liquid. There is also a chance that the materials could be aspirated (enter the lungs instead of being swallowed). Seizures or loss of consciousness because of low blood glucose levels are medical emergencies.

 Untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia can have serious consequences on the body. Hypoxemia refers to low blood oxygen levels, while hypoxia refers to low oxygen levels in the tissues. When oxygen levels consistently fall below normal, it can lead to adverse health events.

One consequence of untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia is tissue damage. When the body's tissues do not receive enough oxygen, they can become damaged or even die. This can have a negative impact on various organs and systems, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.

Another consequence is the impairment of organ function. Oxygen is essential for the proper functioning of organs, and when there is a deficiency, organ function can be compromised. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

In severe cases, untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia can result in organ failure. Without adequate oxygen supply, organs may not be able to carry out their normal functions, leading to organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications.

Furthermore, chronic hypoxemia and hypoxia can lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. This can put strain on the heart and lead to heart failure.

It is important to recognize the early warning signs of low blood oxygen levels and seek medical attention promptly. Supplemental oxygen therapy is often prescribed to restore oxygen balance and prevent further complications. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of hypoxemia or hypoxia, it is recommended to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room for immediate evaluation and treatment.

  or sugar, as simple carbohydrates, act rapidly and will make the blood glucose rise, but the rise will not last very long, as they are broken down quickly by the body. Feeding something containing complex carbohydrates  when the pet is able to eat will make sure another hypoglycemia event does not overtake the rapid rise in blood glucose levels from the sugar solution. Complex carbohydrates take longer to be broken down by the body, so they do not raise blood glucose levels until some time after being eaten. A small meal should be fed and the animal taken for medical evaluation to determine if further

 Anemia is a dangerous condition for dogs.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used for years on humans, and it's now a new and promising way to treat anemia in dogs, too. Anemia can be caused by either lingering disease or sudden blood loss, but either way it is highly dangerous to our closest companions. HBOT may give our dogs the precious time they need for a veterinarian to treat the underlying causes of their anemia.
Anemia, or low red blood cell count, is a condition that can have multiple causes. A dog with a severe injury may become anemic due to blood loss, while another may have hemolytic anemia, a condition where red blood cells are being destroyed inside the body. Nonregenerative anemia, by contrast, is caused by the body not producing enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anemia include pale gums, weakness, decreased appetite, lethargy, and faster breathing and heart rates. The condition can be very serious, and may even lead to shock and death if not treated quickly.
HBOT, or oxygen therapy, is a relatively simple process, although the equipment is expensive. The dog enters a chamber about the size of a small couch and lies down for one to two hours. During that time, the chamber is filled with up to three times the amount of oxygen normally found in the air. The increased oxygen in the air makes it easier for your dog's body to absorb this essential gas, which has a number of medical benefits.
More than 30 to 40 percent blood loss can lead to shock and death in your pet if she's not quickly given a blood transfusion. HBOT therapy can ensure she continues getting enough oxygen for the precious time it takes to obtain and type the blood for transfusion. The treatment also stimulates the stem cells and promotes healing on a cellular level, which may help your best friend recover from the injury or illness that caused her dangerous blood loss.
Vets are optimistic about the potential uses for HBOT in treating our beloved pets. HBOT may be useful in delivering crucial oxygen to blocked tissues in animals with sepsis infections, decreasing swelling from snakebites, preventing tissue death, preventing brain damage in dogs that have suffered head trauma or been resuscitated through CPR, speeding up the healing of large or difficult wounds, and many other applications. While the field of study is relatively new, results show that oxygen therapy has vast potential in treating our pets.

  Hypoxia can occur in any rebreather which contains enough inert gas to allow breathing without triggering automatic gas addition. In an oxygen rebreather this can occur if the loop is not sufficiently purged at the start of use. Purging should be done while breathing off the unit so that the inert gas in the user's lungs is also removed from the system.

 The potential consequences of a shortage of oxygen in the body, known as hypoxia, can be quite severe. The cells in the body, especially those in the central nervous system and the cardiac circulatory system, rely on a continuous and adequate supply of oxygen. Even a brief interruption in the supply of oxygen can cause irreparable damage to these cells. 

Hypoxia can be caused by various factors including inadequate oxygen supply, pulmonary function disorders, impaired oxygen transportation through the blood, a lack of hemoglobin, or disorders in the cardiac circulatory system. In emergency medicine and clinical settings, it is standard practice to provide oxygen to patients to ensure their oxygen demand is met.

When there is a shortage of oxygen, the body may not be able to function properly. Symptoms can range from shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and dizziness to more severe manifestations like loss of consciousness, organ damage, and even death. Timely intervention to restore oxygen supply is crucial to prevent these consequences.

It's important to ensure that patients receive sufficient oxygen in critical situations, such as prior to intubation, to meet their oxygen demand during potentially dangerous periods. This is typically achieved by enriching the lungs' storage space with pure oxygen through various means, such as the use of oxygen applicators and closed systems to deliver oxygen.

If you have any concerns about oxygen levels in your body or suspect hypoxia, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. A healthcare professional can evaluate your condition, provide appropriate treatment, and ensure your oxygen levels are restored to normal.

  attacks. However, scientists who have studied the health of rescue animals who worked Ground Zero have found no major signs of illness. In contrast, a 2007 study of 20,000 human rescue workers, such as firefighters, has found that 70% of these workers suffer from respiratory illnesses. Cynthia Otto, who works for the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine, is currently conducting a study of the health of September 11 rescue dogs. The results of Jake's necropsy will be used as part of the Penn medical study. It is believed that illnesses diagnosed in Jake and other rescue animals may serve as harbingers for possible long-term problems in 9/11 rescue workers, both human and animal.

  is needed. Treatment of a serious hypoglycemia episode is similar to that of diabetic humans: using glucose or glucagon infusions, depending on severity. A part from the medicinal way, lifestyle management of the dog can also be considered when preventing a diabetes attack on the dog. Physical exercising activities such as homeopathy2, walking and swimming of the dog are suggested under behavioral management in treating diabetes because it results in tissue preservation. Dietary management in food service is also essential in preventing diabetes attack. A dietary management may include low fat content foods, complex carbohydrates that aid in slowing down glucose absorption, protein and fiber.

 1 -3.56126 Anemia is a dangerous condition for dogs.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used for years on humans, and it's now a new and promising way to treat anemia in dogs, too. Anemia can be caused by either lingering disease or sudden blood loss, but either way it is highly dangerous to our closest companions. HBOT may give our dogs the precious time they need for a veterinarian to treat the underlying causes of their anemia.
Anemia, or low red blood cell count, is a condition that can have multiple causes. A dog with a severe injury may become anemic due to blood loss, while another may have hemolytic anemia, a condition where red blood cells are being destroyed inside the body. Nonregenerative anemia, by contrast, is caused by the body not producing enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anemia include pale gums, weakness, decreased appetite, lethargy, and faster breathing and heart rates. The condition can be very serious, and may even lead to shock and death if not treated quickly.
HBOT, or oxygen therapy, is a relatively simple process, although the equipment is expensive. The dog enters a chamber about the size of a small couch and lies down for one to two hours. During that time, the chamber is filled with up to three times the amount of oxygen normally found in the air. The increased oxygen in the air makes it easier for your dog's body to absorb this essential gas, which has a number of medical benefits.
More than 30 to 40 percent blood loss can lead to shock and death in your pet if she's not quickly given a blood transfusion. HBOT therapy can ensure she continues getting enough oxygen for the precious time it takes to obtain and type the blood for transfusion. The treatment also stimulates the stem cells and promotes healing on a cellular level, which may help your best friend recover from the injury or illness that caused her dangerous blood loss.
Vets are optimistic about the potential uses for HBOT in treating our beloved pets. HBOT may be useful in delivering crucial oxygen to blocked tissues in animals with sepsis infections, decreasing swelling from snakebites, preventing tissue death, preventing brain damage in dogs that have suffered head trauma or been resuscitated through CPR, speeding up the healing of large or difficult wounds, and many other applications. While the field of study is relatively new, results show that oxygen therapy has vast potential in treating our pets.
 2 -9.92678   Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is treatable and need not shorten the animal's life span or interfere with quality of life. If left untreated, the condition can lead to cataracts, increasing weakness in the legs (neuropathy), malnutrition, ketoacidosis, dehydration, and death. Diabetes mainly affects middle-age and older dogs, but there are juvenile cases. The typical canine diabetes patient is middle-age, female, and overweight at diagnosis. The number of dogs diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has increased three-fold in thirty years. In survival rates from almost the 
 3 -10.28382 Untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia can have serious consequences on the body. Hypoxemia refers to low blood oxygen levels, while hypoxia refers to low oxygen levels in the tissues. When oxygen levels consistently fall below normal, it can lead to adverse health events.

One consequence of untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia is tissue damage. When the body's tissues do not receive enough oxygen, they can become damaged or even die. This can have a negative impact on various organs and systems, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.

Another consequence is the impairment of organ function. Oxygen is essential for the proper functioning of organs, and when there is a deficiency, organ function can be compromised. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

In severe cases, untreated hypoxemia and hypoxia can result in organ failure. Without adequate oxygen supply, organs may not be able to carry out their normal functions, leading to organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications.

Furthermore, chronic hypoxemia and hypoxia can lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. This can put strain on the heart and lead to heart failure.

It is important to recognize the early warning signs of low blood oxygen levels and seek medical attention promptly. Supplemental oxygen therapy is often prescribed to restore oxygen balance and prevent further complications. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of hypoxemia or hypoxia, it is recommended to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room for immediate evaluation and treatment.
 4 -10.37130 The potential consequences of a shortage of oxygen in the body, known as hypoxia, can be quite severe. The cells in the body, especially those in the central nervous system and the cardiac circulatory system, rely on a continuous and adequate supply of oxygen. Even a brief interruption in the supply of oxygen can cause irreparable damage to these cells. 

Hypoxia can be caused by various factors including inadequate oxygen supply, pulmonary function disorders, impaired oxygen transportation through the blood, a lack of hemoglobin, or disorders in the cardiac circulatory system. In emergency medicine and clinical settings, it is standard practice to provide oxygen to patients to ensure their oxygen demand is met.

When there is a shortage of oxygen, the body may not be able to function properly. Symptoms can range from shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and dizziness to more severe manifestations like loss of consciousness, organ damage, and even death. Timely intervention to restore oxygen supply is crucial to prevent these consequences.

It's important to ensure that patients receive sufficient oxygen in critical situations, such as prior to intubation, to meet their oxygen demand during potentially dangerous periods. This is typically achieved by enriching the lungs' storage space with pure oxygen through various means, such as the use of oxygen applicators and closed systems to deliver oxygen.

If you have any concerns about oxygen levels in your body or suspect hypoxia, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. A healthcare professional can evaluate your condition, provide appropriate treatment, and ensure your oxygen levels are restored to normal.

["Fruit is a product of a plant's reproductive system. It is formed from the ovary of a flower, which develops into a fleshy or dry structure containing seeds. Fruits are an essential source of nutrition for many animals, including humans. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer.\n\nFruits are classified into several categories based on their structure and composition. Some common types of fruit include berries, citrus fruits, stone fruits, and pome fruits. Berries, such as strawberries and blueberries, have a soft texture and contain small seeds. Citrus fruits, such as oranges and lemons, have a thick, leathery rind and contain many small seeds. Stone fruits, such as peaches and plums, have a large, hard pit or stone in the center. Pome fruits, such as apples and pears, have a fleshy core surrounded by a thick, leathery skin.\n\nFruits are grown in a variety of environments, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts. They are typically grown in warm, sunny climates, as they require a lot of water and sunlight to grow. Fruits are harvested at different times of the year, depending on the species and the climate. Some fruits, such as bananas and pine", "Fruit comes from what sourceFruit comes from what source\nA. an organism that releases carbon dioxide\nB. an organism that absorbs water through it's branches\nC. an organism that absorbs oxygen\nD. an organism that absorbs water through it's roots"]

 An aggregate fruit, in which one flower contains several separate ovaries, which merge during development. ; A multiple fruit, in which several flowers, each with an ovary, develop into small fruits that are clustered or fused together into a larger fruit. ; A simple fruit formed from a compound ovary. The term compound fruit is not used in technical botanical writing, but is sometimes used when it is not clear which of several fruit types is involved. A compound fruit is "composed of two or more similar parts". A compound fruit may be: Grapes grow in clusters, but are not compound fruits. Each grape is grown from one ovary in one flower, and each grape remains an independent fruit.

   Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses. Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic

  The fruit is a hesperidium, a specialised berry, globose to elongated, 4 – long and 4 – diameter, with a leathery rind or "peel" called a pericarp. The outermost layer of the pericarp is an "exocarp" called the flavedo, commonly referred to as the zest. The middle layer of the pericarp is the mesocarp, which in citrus fruits consists of the white, spongy "albedo", or "pith". The innermost layer of the pericarp is the endocarp. The space inside each segment is a locule filled with juice vesicles, or "pulp". From the endocarp, string-like "hairs" extend into the locules, which provide nourishment to the fruit as it develops.

 As we all know, vegetables are a paramount source of nutrition and vitamins to include in your diet. They reduce many chronic diseases including heart attacks and strokes and are important for keeping a fit and healthy body. Below are 5 vegetables that one should include in their diet: Broccoli – they are full of Vitamin K and C which provide a great source of fiber, folate and potassium. Vitamin K is essential for many proteins used for blood clotting while Vitamin C develops collagen used repairs cuts and heals wounds through the formation of body tissue. The fiber keeps the digestive system healthy whilst the folate allows for the necessary formation of new cells. Garlic – used through ancient civilisations due to its medicinal and health benefits. Garlic contains sulphur compounds called allicin that is formed when it is chopped or crushed and provides potent biological health effects through the digestive system. The vitamin C content in garlic can cause it to act as an anti-inflammatory and prevent against nasty viral and bacterial activities Garlic also has very few calories so is great against weight-loss and obesity. Zucchinis – Many people avoid zucchinis due to their lack of taste however they hold an abundance of goodness. They have many anti-oxidants which assist in weight loss and cholesterol reduction. You could also just eat the zucchini flowers and there are many recipes online on how to cook zucchini flowers. Tomatoes – rich in the anti-oxidant lycopene which is important for bone health. A study revealed removing lycopene from a diet of postmenopausal women caused an increase in the risk of osteoporosis. Tomatoes are also great for having a healthy heart as they lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Spinach – is an extremely valuable source of vitamins A, B2, C and K as well as having manganese, iron, folate, calcium and potassium. Research has found that eating 300g of spinach everyday will lower the amount of oxygen required to energise the muscles of people exercising by 5%. Spinach also reduces the risk of skin cancer. Overall, vegetables are a necessary part of any diet to keep oneself healthy and prevent the body against cancers and disease. Vegetables contain an array of nutrients and vitamins which will also assist with lowering blood pressure, preventing the development of kidney stones and increasing bone density. Hopefully these reasons will get you kickstarted into eating more of the wonderful things that are known as vegetables.

Living in a colder climate, I find summer to be a wonderful time of year for delicious fresh food. The cost and availability of fresh produce is limited in the winter months and now is the time to enjoy what is in season. We get a variety of nutrients from different foods and changing with the seasons can help you to have variety in taste as well as nutrition throughout the year. Summer fruit options Let’s start with a list of some of the delicious summer fruits you may find at your local farmers market or at your grocer: Blackberries Boysenberries Blueberries Cantaloupe Cherries Mangos Nectarines Peaches Plums Pluots Raspberries Tomatoes Watermelon Selecting the best fresh fruit Buying these summer fruits in season will save you money at the store and offer delicious and nutritious food options. But you may find you struggle with choosing the best of each of the fruits. Here are some tips for choosing these fresh fruits at the store. Berries – Look for blackberries or boysenberries that are shiny and plump. For all berries look at the package, tip it upside down to look for signs of mushy fruit. Once berries start to deteriorate it will quickly spread to the other fruit and may ruin the entire package. When choosing cherries look for fruit free of blemishes. Blueberries are the berry that will be found with a dull/matte finish. Melons – All melons should feel heavy for their size. Cantaloupe will have a fragrant smell, but watermelon will not have a noticeable aroma. When gently pushing on the stem end of a cantaloupe it should have a slight give when it is ready to eat. Nectarines, Peaches, Plums and Pluots – Choose fruits that are heavy in size, have a sweet smell and are free of blemishes. When ripe they should have a slight give when you push gently on the fruit. Mangos – Look for fruit that gives slightly when gently pressed. The color may vary though darker green is most likely not yet ripe. Tomatoes – Look for fruit that is unblemished and red in color. Adding summer fruit to your diet Make it simple – chop up a variety of fruit for a mixed fruit salad or simply choose any of the fruits for a snack or for dessert. Prepare mango salsa for topping on fresh fish or chicken – peel and seed 1 mango and dice, mix with 1 chopped green onion, 2 TB fresh cilantro, 1 TB lemon juice and 1 TB lime juice. Add berries to pancakes, waffles or muffins. Snack on fruit kebabs with diced melon or other fruit you enjoy. Add protein such as diced cheese or meat to make it a more filling snack or a small meal. Mash ½ C blueberries and mix with 1 lb. hamburger for added moisture and nutrition to a hamburger patty. Slice tomatoes on a sandwich or in a salad. Add diced nectarines or peaches to a lettuce or pasta salad. Make a blackberry cobbler. Recipes often contain twice the sugar that is needed for a sweet dessert – cut the added sugar by 1/3 to ½. Prepare fresh fruit jam. Mash 1 lb. very ripe fruit (strawberries or other berries, plums, peaches or nectarines), add 2 TB chia seeds and 2 TB honey or maple syrup. Add it to plain Greek yogurt for a delicious breakfast or snack. Dice plums or pluots in cooked oatmeal, add cinnamon for a flavorful breakfast. If any of these foods have not been a part of your diet in the past, be adventurous and try something new. When choosing good quality, adequately ripe fruit you will find wonderful tastes to enjoy all summer long. Happy summer!

 Plane tree, multiple achenes from multiple flowers, in a single fruit structure ; Mulberry, multiple flowers form one fruit ; Breadfruit, multiple flowers form one fruit ; Fig, multiple flowers similar to mulberry infructescence form a multiple fruit inside the inverted inflorescence. This form is called a Syconium.  Multiple fruits, also called collective fruits, are fruiting bodies formed from a cluster of fruiting flowers, the inflorescence. Each flower in the inflorescence produces a fruit, but these mature into a single mass in which each flower has produced a true fruit. After flowering the mass is called an infructescence. Examples are the fig, pineapple, mulberry,

  Botanically, the fruit produced is a berry. The berries develop later in the season; berry development time varies from species to species from a few weeks to a year, although most philodendrons take a few months. The spathe will enlarge to hold the maturing berries. Once the fruit are mature, the spathe will begin to open again, but this time it will break off at the base and fall to the forest floor. Additionally, the berries are edible, although they contain calcium oxalate crystals, and have a taste akin to bananas. Many botanical sources will indicate that the berries are poisonous, probably due to the oxalate crystals. Many tropical plants

  used in everyday language, the words "fruit" and "vegetable" are mutually exclusive. "Fruit" has a precise botanical meaning, being a part that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant. This is considerably different from the word's culinary meaning. While peaches, plums, and oranges are "fruit" in both senses, many items commonly called "vegetables", such as eggplants, bell peppers, and tomatoes, are botanically fruits. The question of whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893. The court ruled unanimously in Nix v. Hedden that a tomato is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, for the purposes of the Tariff of 1883 on imported produce. The court did acknowledge, however, that, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit.

  In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings. In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term "fruit" also includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.

 ** While not all fruits and vegetables require peeling, many do, for a variety of reasons.**Remove the skin.** Be sure to wash all produce thoroughly, and cut away bruised or damaged portions.**Scrub it.To get the freshest flavors while preserving the most nutrients, here's what experts advise.Antioxidants help prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the dangerous form of cholesterol, from oxidizing. This is the process that makes cholesterol stick to the lining of artery walls and contribute to heart disease. Studies show that people who eat flavonoid-rich foods such as apples and onions have lower risks of heart attack than those who do not. In a large prospective study of more than 100,000 people, researchers found that adding one serving of fruits or vegetables to the diet each day lowered the risk of ischemic stroke, a stroke in which the artery to the brain is blocked, by 6 percent. The best protection came from citrus fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, and crucifer-ous vegetables, which include broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. Other studies have shown that antioxidants help prevent Alzheimer's disease. In 2002, researchers studied nearly 5,500 people and found that those who ate diets rich in the antioxidant vitamins C and E lowered their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Citrus fruits, kiwifruit, sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage—all perfect for juicing— are packed with vitamin C, while whole grains, nuts, milk, and egg yolk contain vitamin E.

"Drinking a large variety of vegetable and fruit juices is a wonderful way to get therapeutic amounts of all of these healing compounds," says Dr. Campanelli. For maximum healing benefits, Dr. Bailey recommends drinking about a pint to a quart of mixed vegetable juices each day. #### In the Kitchen

There's more to juicing than merely dropping the pick of the day into the blender, food processor, or juicer. To get the freshest flavors while preserving the most nutrients, here's what experts advise. **Scrub it. ** Be sure to wash all produce thoroughly, and cut away bruised or damaged portions. **Remove the skin. ** While not all fruits and vegetables require peeling, many do, for a variety of reasons.Waxed produce should be peeled before juicing, as should tropical fruits, which often are grown in countries where the use of pesticides isn't well regulated.**Remove the pits and seeds.** Apple seeds, which contain trace amounts of cyanide, should be removed before juicing.Seeds in melons, lemons, and limes and pits from peaches, plums, and other stone fruits should also be removed.

At dawn, a lion came out. She went down and behind the rock. A beautiful house stood there; she tidied it up and ate a meal before coming out to climb the same tree. The man came at the same time, and the next morning, the lion looked about before going on. After three days of this, she could not discover

  their hair as being red. No weapon could physically hurt the bulls, be it spears or arrows because even iron deflected from their skin. The forest bulls hunted herds of wild animals and horses. To protect their flocks, herdsmen who lived in the area dug deep ditches, in which the bulls would fall and consequently choke on their rage. The Troglodytae (cave-dwellers), a nearby tribe, supposedly "judged [this] to be the king of beasts, and rightly so, for it possesses the courage of a lion, the speed of a horse, the strength of a bull, and is stronger than iron."

  Everyone in a king's country had to say "To your good health!" whenever he sneezed, but a shepherd with the staring eyes would not say it. The king summoned him and demanded it, but the shepherd would only say, "To my good health." The chamberlain told him he would be killed if he did not, and the shepherd said that he would say it only if he married the princess. The princess thought him handsome enough to marry, but the king was enraged. He had the shepherd thrown in the white bear's pit, but the shepherd's eyes scared it off. Then he had him thrown into a pit of wild boars, but the shepherd played a pipe and made them dance, so they did not harm him. Then he was to have him thrown into a well of scythes, but the

 Electron micrograph of a human cell infected with SCP-3105.
Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard.
Description: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. SCP-3105 is able to infect almost all animals to some extent, though the infection it causes is asymptomatic in non-human hosts. SCP-3105 can be transmitted by airborne particles, bodily fluids, or an animal vector1.
In humans, SCP-3105 enters the bloodstream and infects neural pathways. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. Symptoms of infection will begin to present themselves an average of 5 days after contraction, though this value varies wildly, depending on the location and mode of initial infection, from 2 hours to 14 days. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious.
Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. It will infect and destroy neurons involved in this process over the course of two days. The method by which SCP-3105 identifies target cells is unknown, and presumed to be anomalous. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia.
After destroying much of the medial temporal lobe, SCP-3105 will infect peripheral glial cells that are left behind, allowing it to remain dormant in the central nervous system for up to 3 months. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days.
SCP-3105 infection also triggers the secretion of cytokines3, deactivating cytoxic T-cells and preventing an effective immune response. This mechanism also prevents artificial attempts at preemptive immunization.
Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.
Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. Armed Response Force Omega-6 was mobilized with the express purpose of destroying all SCP-3105 instances using incendiary munitions. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline.
The following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. Monospaced text represents physical notes4, whereas standard text represents unsent messages and journal entries recovered from an abandoned mobile phone. The material has been ordered chronologically, based on digital timestamps, location of recovery, and chemical dating. A search for the apparent surviving SCP-3105 victim has been initiated, but has yet to produce results.
The light falls in shafts through the fringe of trees that covered the mountainside. It has a soft, yellow glow. It plays across the dirt and grass, dancing to and fro. The air is filled with the songs of insects and birds.
I’m not sure why I’m in the mountains, and I can’t remember driving here, but it’s nice. The cabin’s fully stocked with food. I think I’ll stay here for a while. It’ll be good for all the stress. In the meantime, it looks like my kayak is still in serviceable shape. I might take it out for a run tomorrow.
The sun wheels through the sky, dragging the shadows behind it. It seems to tarnish the firmament, turning the polished silver, yellow, then a blazing red. The mountains put out the fire, and the stars peer out from the endless darkness above.
The river is wild, higher than I’ve ever seen it at this time of year. Maybe it’s the unseasonable warmth? My kayak sustained some damage, so I don’t think I’ll be taking it out again until I can get back to town and repair it. I think I’ll take my time though. The hummingbirds are very pretty.
The bulb draws strength from within itself. It bursts from the ground with an abated ferocity, turning green leaves into the ever-wheeling sun. It clings to the loamy earth and finally creates a single crimson blossom, boldly stating its intent to the greater world. Then it withers in the cold winds.
I woke up in the cabin today. It’s a little unusual, but I understand the allure. It is beautiful out there. The yellow aspens are quite a sight. I think I’ll stay here for a while and destress.
From the Cornell Lab of Ornithology: The Calliope Hummingbird is the smallest long-distance migrant in the world. It will travel 5,000 miles each year from the breeding to wintering grounds. It migrates north along the Pacific Coast in the spring, but returns to the wintering grounds in Mexico via an inland route along the Rocky Mountains.
It looks like there’s a big wildfire to the east. They say the fire season gets longer every year. I noticed today that my kayak’s been scuffed up really badly. I took a look at the locks and I didn’t notice any obvious tampering. I’ll check the windows tomorrow.
A neuron is composed of a soma, dendrons, and axons. It forms the primary unit of the nervous system in all living beings. The clouds roll across the open plain and clash against the towering mountains, turning dark and angry. Thunder echoes through valleys. Photoreceptor cells are stimulated by a structural change in the protein retinal. The cell is then hyperpolarized, triggering an action potential in connected neurons. It’s loud.
The fire is getting closer. The smoke is irritating my throat. I tried to start the car earlier this morning, but it just sputtered. Diagnosing the problem will take too long. I’m heading out on foot tomorrow.
Fire is rebirth. It clears the way, erases the old growth and making room for new shoots. In a few terrifying nights, it ravages its way through everything, bringing even the greatest of giants to their knees. Then there is only ash. But soon the cold winds blow, and bring the dormant seeds of distant places. The land flourishes anew.
I’m not sure what’s going on. I woke up choking on smoke. When I ran outside, the sky was on fire. I’m hiding under a rock, hoping to wait it out.
The night is dark. The valleys below are filled with fireflies. The chop of the rotors shakes the soles of my shoes. The cold wind slaps at my exposed cheeks. In my hand is a plastic syringe.
It sure is cold. The rain is coming down pretty hard, but if I follow this road, I should get somewhere nicer. Right?
The mountains stand in the hazy distance, a dark silhouette against the soft pastel colors of the sunset. Wispy clouds sail by above as the car thrums away, into the golden plains. No trees, no concrete, nothing at all. There is no smoke in the air. The cold wind takes it all away.
There's a road here. I guess I should follow it.
Could you come get me? I'm in the middle of the forest.
What's going on? I need help.
I think I'll follow this road.
Why do all the trees look the same?
Rabies has a 100% mortality rate. In the last trial, it worked too fast, killed the subjects outright in less than an hour. We'll need to reduce its affinity for acetylcholine receptor complexes, maybe put in a timed-self destruct mechanism so that it doesn't go too far.
I'm hungry, but I found some edible berries. It's starting to feel better.
This road seems like a good bet.
Huh. I don't remember sending all these messages. Are they coming through?
Trial 104, Human subject 34, Results: Initially positive. Sudden stroke followed by death after two days.
Trial 230, Large scale application 1, Results: Very positive. Production of emergency amnestic compound authorized. It won't hurt one bit. Just don't look.
If anyone finds this phone, I need help. I'm leaving it on the side of this road because it's about to run out. I'm going to the lights, there might be a town.
Back and forth. Eyes in a empty helmet. They tried to fight. Too late. It's always been too late. The night was very dark. I'm not sure how it happened, but we messed something up. I got a scrape, a mosquito bit me, I don't know. They left me behind, in the middle of the forest. The screams of the town filled the night as they were reborn, again and again. The cold wind whistled through the tops of the trees.
The xylem is the tissue that carries water. The phloem is the tissue that carries sugar. Transpiration allows trees to go taller than they should. No it doesn't. I can't remember.
I can see more. I lost some, but now I can see so much.

 Research by a veterinary pathologist indicates salt is a big factor in preventing and treating grass tetany. Without adequate sodium in the blood, the body grabs onto the most available cation, which would be magnesium, followed by calcium. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down.
Editor’s note: Thomas Swerczek does not, nor did the article “The Grass Tetany Puzzle” intend to, espouse the elimination of trace mineral supplements in grazing programs. Rather, the point of the article was that salt has been overlooked as a potential prevention and treatment factor in grass tetany. It is a condition that, in the U.S., occurs mostly in eastern areas where cattle have access to cool-season grasses.We apologize if there was a lack of clarity on this point.
Grass tetany goes by many names – grass staggers, milk tetany, wheat pasture poisoning, and barley poisoning, to name a few. Just as varied as its name has been the speculation as to the cause of this condition. Grass tetany affects mature cattle that graze lush forage following the freezing of early-spring pastures or the sudden growth after rainfall following a drought. The condition mostly occurs in the eastern U.S. in areas with cool-season grasses.
Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist in Kentucky, thinks the answer may be sodium deficiency.
Grass tetany was first described in Britain in 1930, and was associated with magnesium deficiency and a coexisting calcium deficiency, as well as excess potassium in the blood of affected animals. During cool, wet conditions or regrowth after frost or drought, sodium levels in certain forages plummet, while nitrogen and potassium levels spike.
The traditional recommended preventive has been supplemental dietary magnesium, with treatment consisting of oral and/or intravenous magnesium. But, after examining cattle lost in 2001 following spring frosts in the Midwest – and then analyzing the pastures – Swerczek uncovered some clues about the cause and prevention of grass tetany.
“When I came to Kentucky in 1969, the common preventive for grass tetany was to feed more magnesium. But, cattle wouldn’t eat magnesium free-choice due to its bitter taste, so it was mixed with other feed. And, some farmers fed meat and bone meal, which is high in magnesium,” Swerczek says.
Then, the feeding of dicalcium phosphate and inorganic minerals became common. “Animal scientists and nutritionists thought some forages were poor quality and we needed to add minerals for better utilization. But such supplements still didn’t prevent grass tetany syndrome,” he says.
So, producers evolved to supplementing magnesium during the 2-3 weeks of lush spring growth. When that didn’t reduce grass tetany incidence, Swerczek says nutritionists recommended initiating supplementation even earlier – 4-5 weeks before peak pasture growth.
“That didn’t work, either. So they recommended starting in February, before the grass starts growing. By the 1980s, the recommendation was year-round supplementation, to get it into the animals’ bones,” Swerczek explains. The idea was cattle would access the magnesium out of bone storage when blood levels dropped due to sudden pasture changes.
Swerczek’s training includes veterinary medicine and comparative and nutritional pathology. As a pathologist, he did diagnostics and necropsies on livestock until the early 1970s. Then, he worked as an equine diagnostic research pathologist for 15 years.
In 1986, his necropsy research moved to all classes of livestock. Upon resuming necropsies on cattle, he was shocked to see how much worse the grass tetany situation had become during his hiatus.
“The dead cattle were arriving in a wasted condition I hadn’t seen before 1971, when I’d stopped doing cattle necropsies.” Then, in 1995, he began to see cattle with adult salmonellosis, coccidiosis and other calfhood diseases, which didn’t make sense.
Swerczek collaborated on this project with William McCaw, a DVM searching for answers in several purebred herds. McCaw also had surmised that something related to diet was causing wasting and opportunistic diseases, he says.
“He still used salt houses – little run-in sheds with a feedbunk for loose salt, to keep it out of the weather. Most farmers had moved from loose salt to mineral mixes and salt/mineral blocks,” Swerczek says.
But this rancher had a salt house in every pasture, and wasn’t supplementing magnesium. “He’d been in the cattle business more than 40 years and never had a case of grass tetany,” Swerczek recalls. Was this an indicator that perhaps supplemental magnesium wasn’t needed to prevent grass tetany?
Later, several herds that stopped feeding the high-mineral, low- salt mixes quickly started to turn around. “Most of the cows had diarrhea and were wasting away. But, within 24-48 hours of giving them loose salt, the cattle improved,” Swerczek says.
In particular, Swerczek recalls working with a 1,000-head Angus herd at that time. Driving across the farm with its manager, Swerczek says they encountered a cow that had been down for several days despite multiple treatments with magnesium and calcium. Swerczek had some sea salt, and put it in front of the cow.
“The manager went back three hours later and that cow had gotten up and wandered off. She went down again, however, so he put more salt in front of her. He went out the next morning and she’d gotten up and rejoined the herd,” Swerczek recalls.
In the late 1990s, Swerczek says he visited a farm where cattle were dying in one pasture but not another. The owners had purchased 800 yearlings and pastured half on a farm they owned, with the rest on an adjacent rented farm. On their farm, which featured fertilized clover, the cattle died the following spring, but there were no deaths on the rented pasture across the fence.
Swerczek reasoned that cows go down with grass tetany due to a deficiency in magnesium and calcium, but he didn’t know why salt worked. He then used horses as a research model because similar nitrate-toxicity symptoms were seen in horses when grazing frost-damaged pasture.
Swerczek began by feeding some horses extra protein to raise protein and nitrogen levels in their blood.
“I knew nitrate was involved so I measured nitrate in their blood and put some of the horses on salt, and some on no salt. I found that without salt, the nitrate spikes. When horses had an adequate amount of salt, blood nitrate went down to very low levels,” he explains.
“We’d been taught for many years that nitrate isn’t toxic; it’s only toxic if converted to nitrite. However, nitrate in excess may be indirectly toxic if it interferes with the magnesium and calcium metabolism,” he says.
The animal’s body must eliminate excess nitrate and does this through the cations, especially sodium, he adds.
“Without adequate sodium in the blood, the body grabs onto the most available cation, which would be magnesium, followed by calcium,” Swerczek explains. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down.
“If there’s enough salt available, the body can grab onto the sodium and cows won’t go down with grass tetany. But, if you don’t have salt out on the day this hits, they go down. It must be there all the time, and it can’t be hard salt blocks because cattle can’t eat enough when they suddenly need it,” Swerczek says.
Another piece of the puzzle fell into place after Swerczek learned that some farms – despite having adequate salt out – were losing cattle; the cattle weren’t eating enough of it. The potassium level in grass was spiking after a hard frost, especially when it was lush and highly fertilized. Potassium was 15 times more than normal.
“Since the cations, potassium and sodium, are so close together, the body can’t always differentiate between them. People sometimes use ‘lite’ salt (half potassium chloride, half sodium chloride) to reduce sodium intake. These minerals can substitute for one another. When pastures are high in potassium, if there is nitrate in the damaged grass, they come up together as potassium nitrate,” he explains.
Swerczek theorized that when potassium spikes, even though cattle have salt available, they won’t eat it because the body thinks they already have enough sodium. The animals are actually sodium-starved. but their bodies can’t differentiate between excess potassium and too little sodium.
The body has the ability to keep sodium levels within normal range, but when it gets below that, you only have a few hours before that animal dies. “If you feed excess salt, however, and the animals eat it, they’ll be fine – as long as they have plenty of water,” he explains.
“British scientists in the 1930s noticed salt could prevent grass tetany, but no one put it all together. Grass tetany should be called nitrate toxicity/salt deficiency leading to hypomagnesia/hypocalcemia,” Swerczek says.
As grass tetany tends to occur in the eastern half of the U.S., due to the predominance of cool-season grasses, Swerczek contacted Dale Blevins, a professor of plant science at the University of Missouri, to discuss his theory.
Blevins says he first became aware of sodium’s role in grass tetany during a cow/calf/tetany study performed with graduate student T. Ryan Lock. Lock published two refereed journal articles on phosphorus/magnesium/tetany in 2004 in the journal Forage and Grazinglands as a result of his study. During his thorough review of the literature, Blevins says Lock also found several refereed journal articles from England/New Zealand, many on lactating ewes, where a relationship between sodium and tetany was being studied.
Swerczek encouraged Blevins to research the relationship between adequate sodium in the diet and how it prevents grass tetany. When a catastrophic weather episode occurred in spring 2007, with warm weather followed by frost, Blevins analyzed fast-growing tall fescue to see what changes occurred during frost. He published an article in the February 2011 edition of Plant Management Network linking salt deficiency and grass tetany.
Analysis of the grass revealed that sodium had plummeted, but there was no change in magnesium. Blevins says the outbreak of grass tetany in April 2007 wasn’t due to low dietary magnesium, but impaired magnesium absorption. Since magnesium absorption from the rumen is dependent upon sodium, the sodium deficiency (due to freeze injury and drying of young fescue leaves) could be the most damaging consequence of a spring freeze.
“Blevins confirmed what I’d been telling cattlemen for over 10 years – they should use adequate salt in the diet to help prevent grass tetany,” Swerczek says. Blevins also recommends now that, to reduce the risk of grass tetany following spring frosts and freezes, sodium supplementation should not be overlooked for grazing animals.
Swerczek is convinced that excess potassium and nitrate causes an acute depletion of magnesium and calcium in the blood if there is a deficiency of sodium in the blood. His detailed paper on nitrate toxicity and sodium deficiency is available here.
Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist, cautions that free-choice loose salt isn’t a foolproof preventive of grass tetany, because cattle won’t always consume enough salt if there is excess potassium and nitrate in the diet or forages.
“It may be necessary to force-feed salt (including it in the daily feed ration) or use a salt-mineral mix very high in salt and low in other minerals. It may be necessary to add something to ensure cattle consume some each day,” he says.
Swerczek recommends a pure product like sugar, or adding the salt to a grain ration to entice cattle to consume more sodium when cattle are at risk for grass tetany.
“Stockmen must be careful that salt-mineral mixes don’t contain excessive trace minerals or toxic heavy metals. Excess salt can be eliminated by consuming adequate drinking water, but excess trace minerals or toxic metals can’t be neutralized or eliminated by drinking water,” he says.

By the 1980s, the recommendation was year-round supplementation, to get it into the animals’ bones,” Swerczek explains. The idea was cattle would access the magnesium out of bone storage when blood levels dropped due to sudden pasture changes.
Swerczek’s training includes veterinary medicine and comparative and nutritional pathology. As a pathologist, he did diagnostics and necropsies on livestock until the early 1970s. Then, he worked as an equine diagnostic research pathologist for 15 years.
In 1986, his necropsy research moved to all classes of livestock. Upon resuming necropsies on cattle, he was shocked to see how much worse the grass tetany situation had become during his hiatus.
“The dead cattle were arriving in a wasted condition I hadn’t seen before 1971, when I’d stopped doing cattle necropsies.” Then, in 1995, he began to see cattle with adult salmonellosis, coccidiosis and other calfhood diseases, which didn’t make sense.
Swerczek collaborated on this project with William McCaw, a DVM searching for answers in several purebred herds. McCaw also had surmised that something related to diet was causing wasting and opportunistic diseases, he says.
“He still used salt houses – little run-in sheds with a feedbunk for loose salt, to keep it out of the weather. Most farmers had moved from loose salt to mineral mixes and salt/mineral blocks,” Swerczek says.
But this rancher had a salt house in every pasture, and wasn’t supplementing magnesium. “He’d been in the cattle business more than 40 years and never had a case of grass tetany,” Swerczek recalls. Was this an indicator that perhaps supplemental magnesium wasn’t needed to prevent grass tetany?
Later, several herds that stopped feeding the high-mineral, low- salt mixes quickly started to turn around. “Most of the cows had diarrhea and were wasting away. But, within 24-48 hours of giving them loose salt, the cattle improved,” Swerczek says.
In particular, Swerczek recalls working with a 1,000-head Angus herd at that time. Driving across the farm with its manager, Swerczek says they encountered a cow that had been down for several days despite multiple treatments with magnesium and calcium. Swerczek had some sea salt, and put it in front of the cow.
“The manager went back three hours later and that cow had gotten up and wandered off. She went down again, however, so he put more salt in front of her. He went out the next morning and she’d gotten up and rejoined the herd,” Swerczek recalls.
In the late 1990s, Swerczek says he visited a farm where cattle were dying in one pasture but not another. The owners had purchased 800 yearlings and pastured half on a farm they owned, with the rest on an adjacent rented farm. On their farm, which featured fertilized clover, the cattle died the following spring, but there were no deaths on the rented pasture across the fence.
Swerczek reasoned that cows go down with grass tetany due to a deficiency in magnesium and calcium, but he didn’t know why salt worked. He then used horses as a research model because similar nitrate-toxicity symptoms were seen in horses when grazing frost-damaged pasture.
Swerczek began by feeding some horses extra protein to raise protein and nitrogen levels in their blood.
“I knew nitrate was involved so I measured nitrate in their blood and put some of the horses on salt, and some on no salt. I found that without salt, the nitrate spikes. When horses had an adequate amount of salt, blood nitrate went down to very low levels,” he explains.
“We’d been taught for many years that nitrate isn’t toxic; it’s only toxic if converted to nitrite. However, nitrate in excess may be indirectly toxic if it interferes with the magnesium and calcium metabolism,” he says.
The animal’s body must eliminate excess nitrate and does this through the cations, especially sodium, he adds.
“Without adequate sodium in the blood, the body grabs onto the most available cation, which would be magnesium, followed by calcium,” Swerczek explains. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down.
“If there’s enough salt available, the body can grab onto the sodium and cows won’t go down with grass tetany. But, if you don’t have salt out on the day this hits, they go down. It must be there all the time, and it can’t be hard salt blocks because cattle can’t eat enough when they suddenly need it,” Swerczek says.
Another piece of the puzzle fell into place after Swerczek learned that some farms – despite having adequate salt out – were losing cattle; the cattle weren’t eating enough of it. The potassium level in grass was spiking after a hard frost, especially when it was lush and highly fertilized. Potassium was 15 times more than normal.
“Since the cations, potassium and sodium, are so close together, the body can’t always differentiate between them. People sometimes use ‘lite’ salt (half potassium chloride, half sodium chloride) to reduce sodium intake. These minerals can substitute for one another. When pastures are high in potassium, if there is nitrate in the damaged grass, they come up together as potassium nitrate,” he explains.
Swerczek theorized that when potassium spikes, even though cattle have salt available, they won’t eat it because the body thinks they already have enough sodium. The animals are actually sodium-starved. but their bodies can’t differentiate between excess potassium and too little sodium.
The body has the ability to keep sodium levels within normal range, but when it gets below that, you only have a few hours before that animal dies. “If you feed excess salt, however, and the animals eat it, they’ll be fine – as long as they have plenty of water,” he explains.
“British scientists in the 1930s noticed salt could prevent grass tetany, but no one put it all together. Grass tetany should be called nitrate toxicity/salt deficiency leading to hypomagnesia/hypocalcemia,” Swerczek says.
As grass tetany tends to occur in the eastern half of the U.S., due to the predominance of cool-season grasses, Swerczek contacted Dale Blevins, a professor of plant science at the University of Missouri, to discuss his theory.
Blevins says he first became aware of sodium’s role in grass tetany during a cow/calf/tetany study performed with graduate student T. Ryan Lock. Lock published two refereed journal articles on phosphorus/magnesium/tetany in 2004 in the journal Forage and Grazinglands as a result of his study. During his thorough review of the literature, Blevins says Lock also found several refereed journal articles from England/New Zealand, many on lactating ewes, where a relationship between sodium and tetany was being studied.
Swerczek encouraged Blevins to research the relationship between adequate sodium in the diet and how it prevents grass tetany. When a catastrophic weather episode occurred in spring 2007, with warm weather followed by frost, Blevins analyzed fast-growing tall fescue to see what changes occurred during frost. He published an article in the February 2011 edition of Plant Management Network linking salt deficiency and grass tetany.
Analysis of the grass revealed that sodium had plummeted, but there was no change in magnesium. Blevins says the outbreak of grass tetany in April 2007 wasn’t due to low dietary magnesium, but impaired magnesium absorption. Since magnesium absorption from the rumen is dependent upon sodium, the sodium deficiency (due to freeze injury and drying of young fescue leaves) could be the most damaging consequence of a spring freeze.
“Blevins confirmed what I’d been telling cattlemen for over 10 years – they should use adequate salt in the diet to help prevent grass tetany,” Swerczek says. Blevins also recommends now that, to reduce the risk of grass tetany following spring frosts and freezes, sodium supplementation should not be overlooked for grazing animals.
Swerczek is convinced that excess potassium and nitrate causes an acute depletion of magnesium and calcium in the blood if there is a deficiency of sodium in the blood. His detailed paper on nitrate toxicity and sodium deficiency is available here.
Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist, cautions that free-choice loose salt isn’t a foolproof preventive of grass tetany, because cattle won’t always consume enough salt if there is excess potassium and nitrate in the diet or forages.
“It may be necessary to force-feed salt (including it in the daily feed ration) or use a salt-mineral mix very high in salt and low in other minerals. It may be necessary to add something to ensure cattle consume some each day,” he says.
Swerczek recommends a pure product like sugar, or adding the salt to a grain ration to entice cattle to consume more sodium when cattle are at risk for grass tetany.
“Stockmen must be careful that salt-mineral mixes don’t contain excessive trace minerals or toxic heavy metals. Excess salt can be eliminated by consuming adequate drinking water, but excess trace minerals or toxic metals can’t be neutralized or eliminated by drinking water,” he says.
 2 -11.16897 Electron micrograph of a human cell infected with SCP-3105.
Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard.
Description: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. SCP-3105 is able to infect almost all animals to some extent, though the infection it causes is asymptomatic in non-human hosts. SCP-3105 can be transmitted by airborne particles, bodily fluids, or an animal vector1.
In humans, SCP-3105 enters the bloodstream and infects neural pathways. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. Symptoms of infection will begin to present themselves an average of 5 days after contraction, though this value varies wildly, depending on the location and mode of initial infection, from 2 hours to 14 days. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious.
Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. It will infect and destroy neurons involved in this process over the course of two days. The method by which SCP-3105 identifies target cells is unknown, and presumed to be anomalous. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia.
After destroying much of the medial temporal lobe, SCP-3105 will infect peripheral glial cells that are left behind, allowing it to remain dormant in the central nervous system for up to 3 months. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days.
SCP-3105 infection also triggers the secretion of cytokines3, deactivating cytoxic T-cells and preventing an effective immune response. This mechanism also prevents artificial attempts at preemptive immunization.
Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.
Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. Armed Response Force Omega-6 was mobilized with the express purpose of destroying all SCP-3105 instances using incendiary munitions. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline.
The following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. Monospaced text represents physical notes4, whereas standard text represents unsent messages and journal entries recovered from an abandoned mobile phone. The material has been ordered chronologically, based on digital timestamps, location of recovery, and chemical dating. A search for the apparent surviving SCP-3105 victim has been initiated, but has yet to produce results.
The light falls in shafts through the fringe of trees that covered the mountainside. It has a soft, yellow glow. It plays across the dirt and grass, dancing to and fro. The air is filled with the songs of insects and birds.
I’m not sure why I’m in the mountains, and I can’t remember driving here, but it’s nice. The cabin’s fully stocked with food. I think I’ll stay here for a while. It’ll be good for all the stress. In the meantime, it looks like my kayak is still in serviceable shape. I might take it out for a run tomorrow.
The sun wheels through the sky, dragging the shadows behind it. It seems to tarnish the firmament, turning the polished silver, yellow, then a blazing red. The mountains put out the fire, and the stars peer out from the endless darkness above.
The river is wild, higher than I’ve ever seen it at this time of year. Maybe it’s the unseasonable warmth? My kayak sustained some damage, so I don’t think I’ll be taking it out again until I can get back to town and repair it. I think I’ll take my time though. The hummingbirds are very pretty.
The bulb draws strength from within itself. It bursts from the ground with an abated ferocity, turning green leaves into the ever-wheeling sun. It clings to the loamy earth and finally creates a single crimson blossom, boldly stating its intent to the greater world. Then it withers in the cold winds.
I woke up in the cabin today. It’s a little unusual, but I understand the allure. It is beautiful out there. The yellow aspens are quite a sight. I think I’ll stay here for a while and destress.
From the Cornell Lab of Ornithology: The Calliope Hummingbird is the smallest long-distance migrant in the world. It will travel 5,000 miles each year from the breeding to wintering grounds. It migrates north along the Pacific Coast in the spring, but returns to the wintering grounds in Mexico via an inland route along the Rocky Mountains.
It looks like there’s a big wildfire to the east. They say the fire season gets longer every year. I noticed today that my kayak’s been scuffed up really badly. I took a look at the locks and I didn’t notice any obvious tampering. I’ll check the windows tomorrow.
A neuron is composed of a soma, dendrons, and axons. It forms the primary unit of the nervous system in all living beings. The clouds roll across the open plain and clash against the towering mountains, turning dark and angry. Thunder echoes through valleys. Photoreceptor cells are stimulated by a structural change in the protein retinal. The cell is then hyperpolarized, triggering an action potential in connected neurons. It’s loud.
The fire is getting closer. The smoke is irritating my throat. I tried to start the car earlier this morning, but it just sputtered. Diagnosing the problem will take too long. I’m heading out on foot tomorrow.
Fire is rebirth. It clears the way, erases the old growth and making room for new shoots. In a few terrifying nights, it ravages its way through everything, bringing even the greatest of giants to their knees. Then there is only ash. But soon the cold winds blow, and bring the dormant seeds of distant places. The land flourishes anew.
I’m not sure what’s going on. I woke up choking on smoke. When I ran outside, the sky was on fire. I’m hiding under a rock, hoping to wait it out.
The night is dark. The valleys below are filled with fireflies. The chop of the rotors shakes the soles of my shoes. The cold wind slaps at my exposed cheeks. In my hand is a plastic syringe.
It sure is cold. The rain is coming down pretty hard, but if I follow this road, I should get somewhere nicer. Right?
The mountains stand in the hazy distance, a dark silhouette against the soft pastel colors of the sunset. Wispy clouds sail by above as the car thrums away, into the golden plains. No trees, no concrete, nothing at all. There is no smoke in the air. The cold wind takes it all away.
There's a road here. I guess I should follow it.
Could you come get me? I'm in the middle of the forest.
What's going on? I need help.
I think I'll follow this road.
Why do all the trees look the same?
Rabies has a 100% mortality rate. In the last trial, it worked too fast, killed the subjects outright in less than an hour. We'll need to reduce its affinity for acetylcholine receptor complexes, maybe put in a timed-self destruct mechanism so that it doesn't go too far.
I'm hungry, but I found some edible berries. It's starting to feel better.
This road seems like a good bet.
Huh. I don't remember sending all these messages. Are they coming through?
Trial 104, Human subject 34, Results: Initially positive. Sudden stroke followed by death after two days.
Trial 230, Large scale application 1, Results: Very positive. Production of emergency amnestic compound authorized. It won't hurt one bit. Just don't look.
If anyone finds this phone, I need help. I'm leaving it on the side of this road because it's about to run out. I'm going to the lights, there might be a town.
Back and forth. Eyes in a empty helmet. They tried to fight. Too late. It's always been too late. The night was very dark. I'm not sure how it happened, but we messed something up. I got a scrape, a mosquito bit me, I don't know. They left me behind, in the middle of the forest. The screams of the town filled the night as they were reborn, again and again. The cold wind whistled through the tops of the trees.
The xylem is the tissue that carries water. The phloem is the tissue that carries sugar. Transpiration allows trees to go taller than they should. No it doesn't. I can't remember.
I can see more. I lost some, but now I can see so much.

[2024-06-12 05:18:36,421] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Research by a veterinary pathologist indicates salt is a big factor in preventing and treating grass tetany. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down. Editor’s note: Thomas Swerczek does not, nor did the article “The Grass Tetany Puzzle” intend to, espouse the elimination of trace mineral supplements in grazing programs. Rather, the point of the article was that salt has been overlooked as a potential prevention and treatment factor in grass tetany. It is a condition that, in the U.S., occurs mostly in eastern areas where cattle have access to cool-season grasses.We apologize if there was a lack of clarity on this point. Grass tetany goes by many names – grass staggers, milk tetany, wheat pasture poisoning, and barley poisoning, to name a few. Just as varied as its name has been the speculation as to the cause of this condition. Grass tetany affects mature cattle that graze lush forage following the freezing of early-spring pastures or the sudden growth after rainfall following a drought. Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist in Kentucky, thinks the answer may be sodium deficiency. Grass tetany was first described in Britain in 1930, and was associated with magnesium deficiency and a coexisting calcium deficiency, as well as excess potassium in the blood of affected animals. During cool, wet conditions or regrowth after frost or drought, sodium levels in certain forages plummet, while nitrogen and potassium levels spike. The traditional recommended preventive has been supplemental dietary magnesium, with treatment consisting of oral and/or intravenous magnesium. But, after examining cattle lost in 2001 following spring frosts in the Midwest – and then analyzing the pastures – Swerczek uncovered some clues about the cause and prevention of grass tetany. “When I came to Kentucky in 1969, the common preventive for grass tetany was to feed more magnesium. But, cattle wouldn’t eat magnesium free-choice due to its bitter taste, so it was mixed with other feed. “Animal scientists and nutritionists thought some forages were poor quality and we needed to add minerals for better utilization. But such supplements still didn’t prevent grass tetany syndrome,” he says. When that didn’t reduce grass tetany incidence, Swerczek says nutritionists recommended initiating supplementation even earlier – 4-5 weeks before peak pasture growth.

After destroying much of the medial temporal lobe, SCP-3105 will infect peripheral glial cells that are left behind, allowing it to remain dormant in the central nervous system for up to 3 months. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. This mechanism also prevents artificial attempts at preemptive immunization. Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105.

2024-06-12 05:18:36 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Research by a veterinary pathologist indicates salt is a big factor in preventing and treating grass tetany. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down. Editor’s note: Thomas Swerczek does not, nor did the article “The Grass Tetany Puzzle” intend to, espouse the elimination of trace mineral supplements in grazing programs. Rather, the point of the article was that salt has been overlooked as a potential prevention and treatment factor in grass tetany. It is a condition that, in the U.S., occurs mostly in eastern areas where cattle have access to cool-season grasses.We apologize if there was a lack of clarity on this point. Grass tetany goes by many names – grass staggers, milk tetany, wheat pasture poisoning, and barley poisoning, to name a few. Just as varied as its name has been the speculation as to the cause of this condition. Grass tetany affects mature cattle that graze lush forage following the freezing of early-spring pastures or the sudden growth after rainfall following a drought. Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist in Kentucky, thinks the answer may be sodium deficiency. Grass tetany was first described in Britain in 1930, and was associated with magnesium deficiency and a coexisting calcium deficiency, as well as excess potassium in the blood of affected animals. During cool, wet conditions or regrowth after frost or drought, sodium levels in certain forages plummet, while nitrogen and potassium levels spike. The traditional recommended preventive has been supplemental dietary magnesium, with treatment consisting of oral and/or intravenous magnesium. But, after examining cattle lost in 2001 following spring frosts in the Midwest – and then analyzing the pastures – Swerczek uncovered some clues about the cause and prevention of grass tetany. “When I came to Kentucky in 1969, the common preventive for grass tetany was to feed more magnesium. But, cattle wouldn’t eat magnesium free-choice due to its bitter taste, so it was mixed with other feed. “Animal scientists and nutritionists thought some forages were poor quality and we needed to add minerals for better utilization. But such supplements still didn’t prevent grass tetany syndrome,” he says. When that didn’t reduce grass tetany incidence, Swerczek says nutritionists recommended initiating supplementation even earlier – 4-5 weeks before peak pasture growth. The idea was cattle would access the magnesium out of bone storage when blood levels dropped due to sudden pasture changes. Swerczek’s training includes veterinary medicine and comparative and nutritional pathology. Upon resuming necropsies on cattle, he was shocked to see how much worse the grass tetany situation had become during his hiatus. McCaw also had surmised that something related to diet was causing wasting and opportunistic diseases, he says. “He’d been in the cattle business more than 40 years and never had a case of grass tetany,” Swerczek recalls. Was this an indicator that perhaps supplemental magnesium wasn’t needed to prevent grass tetany? “Most of the cows had diarrhea and were wasting away. But, within 24-48 hours of giving them loose salt, the cattle improved,” Swerczek says. In particular, Swerczek recalls working with a 1,000-head Angus herd at that time. Driving across the farm with its manager, Swerczek says they encountered a cow that had been down for several days despite multiple treatments with magnesium and calcium. Swerczek had some sea salt, and put it in front of the cow. “The manager went back three hours later and that cow had gotten up and wandered off. He went out the next morning and she’d gotten up and rejoined the herd,” Swerczek recalls. The owners had purchased 800 yearlings and pastured half on a farm they owned, with the rest on an adjacent rented farm. On their farm, which featured fertilized clover, the cattle died the following spring, but there were no deaths on the rented pasture across the fence. Swerczek reasoned that cows go down with grass tetany due to a deficiency in magnesium and calcium, but he didn’t know why salt worked. He then used horses as a research model because similar nitrate-toxicity symptoms were seen in horses when grazing frost-damaged pasture. “I knew nitrate was involved so I measured nitrate in their blood and put some of the horses on salt, and some on no salt. When horses had an adequate amount of salt, blood nitrate went down to very low levels,” he explains. “We’d been taught for many years that nitrate isn’t toxic; it’s only toxic if converted to nitrite. However, nitrate in excess may be indirectly toxic if it interferes with the magnesium and calcium metabolism,” he says. The animal’s body must eliminate excess nitrate and does this through the cations, especially sodium, he adds. When the cow consumes frost-damaged forage and the spike of nitrate occurs, her body accesses magnesium in the blood to eliminate the nitrate. This depletes the body and the cow goes down. “If there’s enough salt available, the body can grab onto the sodium and cows won’t go down with grass tetany. It must be there all the time, and it can’t be hard salt blocks because cattle can’t eat enough when they suddenly need it,” Swerczek says. Another piece of the puzzle fell into place after Swerczek learned that some farms – despite having adequate salt out – were losing cattle; the cattle weren’t eating enough of it. The animals are actually sodium-starved. but their bodies can’t differentiate between excess potassium and too little sodium. “If you feed excess salt, however, and the animals eat it, they’ll be fine – as long as they have plenty of water,” he explains. “British scientists in the 1930s noticed salt could prevent grass tetany, but no one put it all together. Grass tetany should be called nitrate toxicity/salt deficiency leading to hypomagnesia/hypocalcemia,” Swerczek says. Blevins says he first became aware of sodium’s role in grass tetany during a cow/calf/tetany study performed with graduate student T. Ryan Lock. Lock published two refereed journal articles on phosphorus/magnesium/tetany in 2004 in the journal Forage and Grazinglands as a result of his study. During his thorough review of the literature, Blevins says Lock also found several refereed journal articles from England/New Zealand, many on lactating ewes, where a relationship between sodium and tetany was being studied. When a catastrophic weather episode occurred in spring 2007, with warm weather followed by frost, Blevins analyzed fast-growing tall fescue to see what changes occurred during frost. He published an article in the February 2011 edition of Plant Management Network linking salt deficiency and grass tetany. Blevins says the outbreak of grass tetany in April 2007 wasn’t due to low dietary magnesium, but impaired magnesium absorption. Since magnesium absorption from the rumen is dependent upon sodium, the sodium deficiency (due to freeze injury and drying of young fescue leaves) could be the most damaging consequence of a spring freeze. “Blevins confirmed what I’d been telling cattlemen for over 10 years – they should use adequate salt in the diet to help prevent grass tetany,” Swerczek says. Blevins also recommends now that, to reduce the risk of grass tetany following spring frosts and freezes, sodium supplementation should not be overlooked for grazing animals. Thomas Swerczek, a veterinary pathologist, cautions that free-choice loose salt isn’t a foolproof preventive of grass tetany, because cattle won’t always consume enough salt if there is excess potassium and nitrate in the diet or forages. “It may be necessary to force-feed salt (including it in the daily feed ration) or use a salt-mineral mix very high in salt and low in other minerals. Swerczek recommends a pure product like sugar, or adding the salt to a grain ration to entice cattle to consume more sodium when cattle are at risk for grass tetany. “Stockmen must be careful that salt-mineral mixes don’t contain excessive trace minerals or toxic heavy metals. Excess salt can be eliminated by consuming adequate drinking water, but excess trace minerals or toxic metals can’t be neutralized or eliminated by drinking water,” he says. Supplemented by a foldout table for navigation computations, folded paper scales for measuring distances, and a unique worldwide chart, The Raft Book demonstrates the usefulness of the Polynesian star-based passage-making technique. ; Gatty found the lore of birds especially useful for castaways. One day, she heard a moan, and found a lion with a thorn in its paw. She pulled it out, and the lion thanked her by licking her hand, but she could not find the cows again. Her master beat her again and set to her to herding pigs. A year later, the lion appeared for a third time, wounded, she aided it, the pigs vanished,

  Both under-watering and over-watering can be detrimental to a houseplant. Different species of houseplants require different soil moisture levels. Brown crispy tips on a plant's leaves are a sign that the plant is under-watered. Yellowing leaves can show that the plant is over watered. Most plants can not withstand their roots sitting in water and will often lead to root rot. Most species of houseplant will tolerate low humidity environments if they're watered regularly. Different plants require different amounts of light, for different durations. Houseplants are generally grown in specialized soils called potting compost or potting soil. A good potting compost mixture includes soil conditioners to provide the plant with nutrients, support, adequate drainage, and proper aeration. Most potting composts contain a combination of peat and vermiculite or perlite. Plants require soil minerals, mainly nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. Houseplants do not have a continuous feed of nutrients

  they are fertilised regularly. Phosphorus is essential for flowering or fruiting plants and potassium is essential for strong roots and increased nutrient uptake. House plants are generally planted in pots that have drainage holes in the bottom of the pot to reduce the likelihood of over watering and standing water. A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth. Generally, a plant can stay in the same pot for two or so years. Pots come in a variety of types as well, but usually can be broken down into two groups: porous and non-porous. Porous pots provide better aeration as air passes laterally through the sides of the pot. Non-porous pots such as glazed or plastic pots tend to hold moisture longer and restrict airflow.

  Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and development, but most of the world's soil is limited in this important plant nutrient. Plants can utilize P mainly in the form if soluble inorganic phosphate (Pi) but are subjected to abiotic stress of P-limitation when there is not sufficient soluble PO4 available in the soil. Phosphorus forms insoluble complexes with Ca and Mg in alkaline soils and Al and Fe in acidic soils that makes it unavailable for plant roots. When there is limited bioavailable P in the soil, plants show extensive abiotic stress phenotype such as short primary roots and more lateral roots and root hairs to make more surface available for Pi absorption, exudation of organic acids and phosphatase to release Pi from complex P containing molecules and make it available for growing plants' organs. It has been shown that PHR1, a MYB - related transcription factor is a master regulator of P-starvation response in plants. PHR1 also has been shown to regulate extensive remodeling of lipids and metabolites during phosphorus limitation stress

 Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life.  It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.

The science that studies the physiological process of nutrition is called nutritional science (also nutrition science).

Nutritional groups 

Organisms primarily provide themselves with carbon in one of two ways: autotrophy (the self-production of organic food) and heterotrophy (the consumption of existing organic carbon). Combined with the source of energy, either light (phototrophy) or chemical (chemotrophy), there are four primary nutritional groups for organisms.

Nutrients 

Nutrients are substances used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The seven major classes of relevant nutrients for animals (including humans) are carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and water. Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients (carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fats, proteins, and water needed in gram quantities) or micronutrients (vitamins and minerals needed in milligram or microgram quantities).

Diet 

In nutrition, the diet of an organism is the sum of foods it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods.

Human nutrition 

Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients from food that are necessary to support human life and good health.
In humans, poor nutrition can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and  stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.

Animal nutrition

Animal nutrition focuses on the dietary nutrients needs of animals, often in comparison (or contrast) to other organisms like plants. Carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting, with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize. Animals generally have a higher requirement of energy in comparison to plants.

Plant nutrition

Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that can limit plant growth according to Liebig's law of the minimum is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in the air, and hydrogen, which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen fixation process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element and vice versa.

 Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life.  It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.

The science that studies the physiological process of nutrition is called nutritional science (also nutrition science).

Nutritional groups 

Organisms primarily provide themselves with carbon in one of two ways: autotrophy (the self-production of organic food) and heterotrophy (the consumption of existing organic carbon). Combined with the source of energy, either light (phototrophy) or chemical (chemotrophy), there are four primary nutritional groups for organisms.

Nutrients 

Nutrients are substances used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The seven major classes of relevant nutrients for animals (including humans) are carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and water. Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients (carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fats, proteins, and water needed in gram quantities) or micronutrients (vitamins and minerals needed in milligram or microgram quantities).

Diet 

In nutrition, the diet of an organism is the sum of foods it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods.

Human nutrition 

Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients from food that are necessary to support human life and good health.
In humans, poor nutrition can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and  stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.

Animal nutrition

Animal nutrition focuses on the dietary nutrients needs of animals, often in comparison (or contrast) to other organisms like plants. Carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting, with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize. Animals generally have a higher requirement of energy in comparison to plants.

Plant nutrition

Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that can limit plant growth according to Liebig's law of the minimum is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in the air, and hydrogen, which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil.

  changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the microbiota mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

  the irrigation water is consumed by the plants. The maximum attainable irrigation efficiency is about 70% but usually it is less than 60%. This means that minimum 30%, but usually more than 40% of the irrigation water is not evaporated and it must go somewhere. Most of the water lost this way is stored underground which can change the original hydrology of local aquifers considerably. Many aquifers cannot absorb and transport these quantities of water, and so the water table rises leading to waterlogging. Waterlogging causes three problems: Aquifer conditions in irrigated land and the groundwater flow have an important role in soil salinization, as illustrated here :

A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions. The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses

 1 -9.19632  Both under-watering and over-watering can be detrimental to a houseplant. Different species of houseplants require different soil moisture levels. Brown crispy tips on a plant's leaves are a sign that the plant is under-watered. Yellowing leaves can show that the plant is over watered. Most plants can not withstand their roots sitting in water and will often lead to root rot. Most species of houseplant will tolerate low humidity environments if they're watered regularly. Different plants require different amounts of light, for different durations. Houseplants are generally grown in specialized soils called potting compost or potting soil. A good potting compost mixture includes soil conditioners to provide the plant with nutrients, support, adequate drainage, and proper aeration. Most potting composts contain a combination of peat and vermiculite or perlite. Plants require soil minerals, mainly nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. Houseplants do not have a continuous feed of nutrients 
 2 -10.14699  they are fertilised regularly. Phosphorus is essential for flowering or fruiting plants and potassium is essential for strong roots and increased nutrient uptake. House plants are generally planted in pots that have drainage holes in the bottom of the pot to reduce the likelihood of over watering and standing water. A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth. Generally, a plant can stay in the same pot for two or so years. Pots come in a variety of types as well, but usually can be broken down into two groups: porous and non-porous. Porous pots provide better aeration as air passes laterally through the sides of the pot. Non-porous pots such as glazed or plastic pots tend to hold moisture longer and restrict airflow.

 4 -10.42446  Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and development, but most of the world's soil is limited in this important plant nutrient. Plants can utilize P mainly in the form if soluble inorganic phosphate (Pi) but are subjected to abiotic stress of P-limitation when there is not sufficient soluble PO4 available in the soil. Phosphorus forms insoluble complexes with Ca and Mg in alkaline soils and Al and Fe in acidic soils that makes it unavailable for plant roots. When there is limited bioavailable P in the soil, plants show extensive abiotic stress phenotype such as short primary roots and more lateral roots and root hairs to make more surface available for Pi absorption, exudation of organic acids and phosphatase to release Pi from complex P containing molecules and make it available for growing plants' organs.

House plants are generally planted in pots that have drainage holes in the bottom of the pot to reduce the likelihood of over watering and standing water. A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth.

['When it comes to choosing a saw for your next DIY project, you might be wondering which material will last the longest. While wooden saws have been around for centuries, they are not the most durable option. Iron saws are a popular choice due to their strength and durability, but they can be heavy and difficult to maneuver. Aluminum saws are lightweight and easy to handle, but they may not be as strong as iron saws. Plastic saws are the lightest option, but they are not as durable as other materials.\n\nIn terms of longevity, iron saws are the clear winner. They are made of high-quality steel and can withstand heavy use over time. Aluminum saws are also durable, but they may not be as strong as iron saws. Plastic saws are not as durable and may not last as long as other materials.\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, iron saws require regular sharpening and oiling to keep them in good condition. Aluminum saws are low maintenance and do not require as much upkeep. Plastic saws are the easiest to maintain, as they do not require any oiling or sharpening.\n\nIn terms of cost, iron saws are typically the most expensive option. Aluminum saws are more affordable, while plastic saws are the most cost-effective.\n\nOverall, if you are', 'Which of these saws will last longer?Which of these saws will last longer?\nA. iron saw\nB. aluminium saw\nC. plastic saw\nD. wooden saw']

  buncher and harvester. Chainsaws have almost entirely replaced simple man-powered saws in forestry. They are made in many sizes, from small electric saws intended for home and garden use, to large "lumberjack" saws. Members of military engineer units are trained to use chainsaws, as are firefighters to fight forest fires and to ventilate structure fires. Three main types of chainsaw sharpeners are used: handheld file, electric chainsaw, and bar-mounted. The first electric chainsaw was invented by Stihl in 1926. Corded chainsaws became available for sale to the public from the 1960s onwards, but these were never as successful commercially as the older gas-powered type due to limited

Some are equipped with a sliding rail system or have a pivot arm to cut wider work pieces when laid flat on the table of the saw and flush against the fence. This is known as a sliding compound miter saw. Miter saws are primarily used for cutting wood trim and molding, but also can be used to cut metal, masonry, and plastics, provided the appropriate type of blade is used for the material being cut.

European contact also brought scissors to the Inuit, but they were not widely adopted, as they do not cut furry hides as cleanly as sharp knives. Today, many tools are mail-ordered or handmade to suit from available materials. During fieldwork conducted on Baffin Island in the 1980s, anthropologist Jill Oakes described ulu being made from saw blades, with handles made from materials as varied as "plastic bread board, an old gun stock or scrap lumber," shaped to fit the user's hand.

 Every year, thousands of people suffer serious hand injuries while using power saws. All types of saws — including circular saws, jigsaws, reciprocating saws and table saws — can easily send you or a loved one to the hospital for emergency hand surgery.
Hand injuries from power saws can be minor, but many are more serious, requiring emergency reconstruction and surgical treatment. The good news is that this type of injury can be prevented if tool operators are careful to follow safety protocols and precautions.
The severity of a power saw injury depends upon its location — finger, hand or wrist — as well as the depth of penetration. Certain saw characteristics, including blade thickness, tooth pattern and force, also have an effect on the degree of injury.
Contact with the blade can cause injury to both soft tissues and bone. Sometimes, only the skin is injured. In most cases, however, the tendons, muscles and/or nerves are involved, which may result in a loss of feeling or motor function along with circulation problems. A saw can also break a bone, cause an amputation or generate electric shocks and burns.
Surgical treatment is a must for most hand and upper extremity injuries from power saws. Stitches may be enough for cuts, while larger skin injuries may require grafts. Tendons and nerves can sometimes be repaired, and some amputations can be reattached. Broken bones may need repair with wires, plates and screws, followed by casting.
Not all treatment options are appropriate for every power saw injury. A hand and wrist specialist can recommend a feasible approach, with the goal of optimizing overall function. However, even with treatment, some patients may continue to experience weakness, numbness and stiffness.
If you suffer any type of industrial injury to the hand, you’ll need prompt medical attention and potentially emergency hand surgery. For expert care in the greater Salt Lake City area, contact Dr. J. Douglas Burrows at the Center of Orthopedic & Rehabilitation Excellence.

  while the saw head moves, making kick-back almost impossible, and normally allowing hands to be kept clear of the blade. Also the saw head is usually drawn back, then lowered and fed forward through the material so that binding is unlikely. Sliding compound miter saws are relatively portable, easy to set up, and robust enough to maintain accuracy even when moved around. Because they cut from above it is not necessary to adjust blade depth for different thicknesses of work piece and, like any bench machine, repeat cuts are very easy. Most saws have an adjustable scale plate for table swiveling, with positive stops at commonly used angles. Also, there are usually adjustable stops at 90 and 45 degrees for tilting

It needs much care, though, and can easily rust and corrode if not waterproofed. Aluminum is more common than steel furniture, mostly because it does not rust, although it oxidizes, turning into a chalky white. It is also lighter than steel, making it more desirable. Cast and heavy tube aluminum give better quality. Aluminum has to be thicker than steel if it is to have as much strength. Tubular aluminum is flexible and hollowing, besides less sturdy. However, its lightness makes for an ideal poolside furniture and is mainly used for benches, folding chairs and swing sets.

 Nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, and full-fat soy products are also high in fat.With meats and dairy products front and center in their diets, they not only get too much fat overall, they also get the wrong kind— _saturated_ fat, which boosts cholesterol and aggravates insulin resistance.Most people in Western countries get many times the needed amount.Your body easily absorbs this form when it's in need of more iron, but the iron passes harmlessly out of the body when you have all you need. In contrast, meats contain heme iron, which is like an uninvited guest at your party: It barges in whether you need it or not. Over the long run, meat eaters tend to accumulate too much iron. If you are anemic, do not rush out and buy iron supplements, or worse, add lots of meat to your diet. Instead, work with your doctor to find out what kind of anemia you have and _why_ it occurred. Anemia can be a sign of kidney disease, it can be caused by certain drugs, and it can be a sign of blood loss from your digestive tract caused by gastrointestinal irritation or even colon cancer. It is essential that you be evaluated and treated appropriately. If you do need extra iron, turn first to greens and beans. Vitamin C–rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, increase the absorption of iron from the other foods you eat, and avoiding dairy products helps, too. They are very low in iron and actually reduce its absorption from your digestive tract. **Zinc. ** Zinc plays important roles in immune function, wound healing, and many other biological functions, but as with iron, you can have too much of a good thing. The most healthful sources include legumes, nuts, and fortified breakfast cereals (e.g., Post Grape-Nuts, bran flakes, and granola). **Fat. ** Good fats, bad fats, and too much fat—how do we make sense of it all? The most important fat fact is this: Your body's actual fat requirement is minuscule, as you saw earlier. Most people in Western countries get many times the needed amount. With meats and dairy products front and center in their diets, they not only get too much fat overall, they also get the wrong kind— _saturated_ fat, which boosts cholesterol and aggravates insulin resistance. Nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, and full-fat soy products are also high in fat.As you also saw earlier, most vegetables, fruits, and beans contain very little fat, and what they do have is a healthful mixture, including traces of the essential fats alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid.

McCulloch in North America started to produce chainsaws in 1948. The early models were heavy, two-person devices with long bars. Often, chainsaws were so heavy that they had wheels like dragsaws. Other outfits used driven lines from a wheeled power unit to drive the cutting bar. After World War II, improvements in aluminum and engine design lightened chainsaws to the point where one person could carry them.

 If you have any of these—especially if you also have heavy periods—get checked out by your doctor and consider taking an iron supplement.Anemia can cause fatigue as well as shortness of breath, light-headedness, and heart palpitations during exercise.When cortisol is elevated, your liver pumps out more of the hormone hepcidin, which has a negative impact on iron absorption.I personally don't believe it's a good idea to manipulate your cycle with the Pill because of the performance-hindering side effects. It's better to mitigate your menstrual symptoms naturally using the advice in this chapter. Or, if you really want to control the timing of your cycle, use an intrauterine device (IUD), vaginal ring, or other localized hormone product. It's also important to remember that oral contraceptives such as the Pill are estrogen/progesterone based. That means your hormones, which are already high during the luteal phase, are even higher. Even during the placebo week, your natural estrogen levels will surge to mimic the luteal phase. The Pill seems to have particularly ill effects on your muscle tissue and strength. In one study, women not taking oral contraceptives saw a 40 to 60 percent greater gain in muscle mass from training than their peers on the Pill saw. Other research finds that oral contraceptives slow muscle recovery after a hard workout and may dim your aerobic capacity. **Watch out for heavy bleeding. ** If you have heavy periods, you're at higher risk of becoming anemic because your body may not be able to pump up your blood-iron stores fast enough to keep pace with your blood loss. Your risk is even greater if you are an athletic woman, since you have more muscle stress, damage, and inflammation from high levels of cortisol following hard efforts. When cortisol is elevated, your liver pumps out more of the hormone hepcidin, which has a negative impact on iron absorption. Anemia can cause fatigue as well as shortness of breath, light-headedness, and heart palpitations during exercise. If you have any of these—especially if you also have heavy periods—get checked out by your doctor and consider taking an iron supplement.** These days my clients are all about tracking every little move.They have activity trackers and sleep monitors and apps that help them analyze every morsel they put into their mouths.Yet I'm surprised how few women make note of their menstrual cycle and how they feel during it.Start now.

['The sun, which is the largest star in our solar system, is the most visible in the day. It provides light and heat to the Earth, allowing for the growth of plants and the sustenance of life. The sun is a yellow dwarf star, located at the center of our solar system, and is approximately 150 million kilometers away from Earth. It is a main-sequence star, meaning that it is currently in the middle of its life cycle, and will continue to shine for another 5 billion years before it eventually runs out of fuel and collapses into a white dwarf. The sun\'s diameter is approximately 1.3 million kilometers, which is over 100 times larger than Earth. It is also incredibly hot, with a surface temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius. Despite its immense size and heat, the sun is not visible at night due to its distance from Earth and the fact that it is obscured by the Earth\'s shadow. However, during the day, the sun is the most visible star in the sky, providing us with light, warmth, and energy.\n"""\n\n\nPassage:"""\nThe Orion Star Cluster, also known as M42 or the Great Nebula, is a young and vibrant star cluster located in the constellation Orion.

   At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity. The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth. The Maunder

  Teegarden’s Star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623 °C or 4,760 F). Due to the very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star it was only discovered in 2003, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the Sun, with age of 8 billion years. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population

Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona. At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement

  Orion's Belt or The Belt of Orion is an asterism within the constellation. It consists of the three bright stars Zeta (Alnitak), Epsilon (Alnilam), and Delta (Mintaka). Alnitak is around 800 light years away from earth and is 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun; much of its radiation is in the ultraviolet range, which the human eye cannot see. Alnilam is approximately 1340 light years away from Earth, shines with magnitude 1.70, and with ultraviolet light is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Mintaka is 915 light years away and shines with magnitude 2.21. It is 90,000 times more luminous than the Sun and is a double star: the two orbit each other every 5.73 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion's Belt is best visible in the night sky during the month of January around 9:00 pm, when it is approximately around the local meridian. Just southwest of Alnitak lies Sigma Orionis, a multiple star system composed of five stars that have a combined apparent magnitude of 3.7 and lying 1150 light years distant. Southwest of Mintaka lies the quadruple star Eta Orionis.

It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 times that of the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 149 ± 2 light-years away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K.

  Gamma Scuti, Latinized from γ Scuti, is a single, white-hued star in the southern constellation of Scutum. The apparent visual magnitude of 4.67 indicates this is a dim star but visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 10.21 mas as seen from Earth, this star is located about 319 light years from the Sun. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A2:V. At the age of 237 million years, it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 222 km/s. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. The star has an estimated 2.91 times the mass of the Sun and 4.1 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.

  Gamma Piscium (Gamma Psc, γ Piscium, γ Psc) is a star approximately 138 light years away from Earth, in the zodiac constellation of Pisces. It is a yellow star with a spectral type of G8 III, meaning it has a surface temperature of 4,833 K and is a giant star. It is slightly cooler than the Sun, yet it is 11 solar radii in size and shines with the light of 63 Suns. At an apparent magnitude of 3.7, it is the second brightest star in the constellation Pisces, between Eta and Alpha. Once a white A2 star, it is 5.5 billion years old. Gamma Piscium moves across the sky at three-quarters of an arcsecond per year, which at 138 light years corresponds to 153 kilometers per second. This suggests it is a visitor from another part of the Milky Way Galaxy; in astronomical terms, it will quickly leave the vicinity of the Sun. Its metallicity is only one-fourth that of the Sun, and visitors from outside the thin disk that composes the Milky Way tend to be metal-poor. Gamma Piscium lies inside an asterism known as the "circlet of Pisces."

  The planet orbits a (G-type) Kepler-90, its host star. The star is 1.2 times as massive as the Sun and is 1.2 times as large as the Sun. It is estimated to be 2 billion years old, with a surface temperature of 6080 K. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14. It is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, which typically can only see objects with a magnitude around 6 or less.

  The parent star K2-38 is a G2 main-sequence star, similar to our own Sun. It is 1.10 and 1.07, with a temperature of 5757 K and an unknown age. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is about 4.5 billion years old. The visual magnitude of K2-38, or how bright it appears to the human eye, is 11.39. Therefore, it is far too dim to be seen without a telescope.

["A flashlight is an essential tool for navigating through the dark. It works by converting electrical energy into light energy through a process called electroluminescence. The flashlight's bulb, or light source, contains a filament that is heated by an electric current. This filament emits light as it glows, and the light is then focused and directed through a lens or reflector.\n\nThe flashlight's battery provides the electrical energy needed to power the bulb. The battery is connected to the bulb through a series of wires and a switch, which allows the user to turn the flashlight on and off.\n\nThe flashlight's bulb emits light in the form of photons, which are particles of light. These photons are produced when the filament in the bulb is heated to a high temperature. The heat causes the filament to emit electrons, which then collide with other electrons in the bulb, producing photons.\n\nIn order for a flashlight to radiate photons, it must have electron flow. This is because electron flow is what heats the filament in the bulb, causing it to emit photons. Without electron flow, the bulb would not be able to produce light.\n\nIn summary, a flashlight requires electron flow in order to radiate photons. The flashlight's battery provides the electrical energy needed to power the", 'A flashlight will need this in order to radiate photons:A flashlight will need this in order to radiate photons:\nA. radiation\nB. acoustic energy\nC. vibrations\nD. electron flow']

  anode at a slower rate, filling some localized pressure differential created by the ions. At normal pressures this motion is in very short distances, because the particles interact and bump into each other, and, exchanging electrons, they reverse direction. Thus, during the pulse neutral atoms are constantly ionizing and recombining, emitting a photon each time, relaying electrons from the cathode to the anode. The greater the number of ion transitions for each electron; the better the conversion efficiency will be, so longer tubes or higher pressures both help increase the efficiency of the lamp. During the pulse, skin effect causes free electrons to gather near the inner wall, creating an electron sheath around the plasma. This makes the

   As the current pulse travels through the tube, it ionizes the atoms, causing them to jump to higher energy-levels. Three types of particles are found within the arc plasma, consisting of electrons, positively ionized atoms, and neutral atoms. At any given time during the flash, the ionized atoms make up less than 1% of the plasma and produce all of the emitted light. As they recombine with their lost electrons they immediately drop back to a lower energy-state, releasing photons in the process. The methods of transferring energy occur in three separate ways, called "bound-bound," "free-bound," and "free-free" transitions. Within the plasma, positive ions accelerate toward the cathode while electrons accelerate toward the anode. Neutral atoms move toward

   The lamp comprises a hermetically sealed glass tube, which is filled with a noble gas, usually xenon, and electrodes to carry electrical current to the gas. Additionally, a high voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas as a trigger event. A charged capacitor is usually used to supply energy for the flash, so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is triggered.

  Shown at right is an example of a simple system that would exhibit the bulk photovoltaic effect. There are two electronic levels per unit cell, separated by a large energy gap, say 3 eV. The blue arrows indicate radiative transitions, i.e. an electron can absorb a UV photon to go from A to B, or it can emit a UV photon to go from B to A. The purple arrows indicate nonradiative transitions, i.e. an electron can go from B to C by emitting many phonons, or can go from C to B by absorbing many phonons. When light is shining, an electron will occasionally move right by absorbing a photon and going from A to B to C. However, it will almost never move in the reverse direction, C to B to A, because the transition from C to B cannot be excited by photons, but instead requires an improbably large thermal fluctuation. Therefore, there is a net rightward photocurrent. Because the electrons undergo a "shift" each time they absorb a photon (on average), this photocurrent is sometimes called a "shift current".

  The electrodes of the lamp are usually connected to a capacitor, which is charged to a relatively high voltage (generally between 250 and 5000 volts), using a step up transformer and a rectifier. The gas, however, exhibits extremely high resistance, and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized. Once ionized, or "triggered", a spark will form between the electrodes, allowing the capacitor   to discharge. The sudden surge of electric current quickly heats the gas to a plasma state, where electrical resistance becomes very low. There are several methods of triggering.

   A flashlight (US, Canada) or torch (UK, Australia) is a portable hand-held electric light. Formerly, the light source typically was a miniature incandescent light bulb, but these have been displaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) since the mid-2000s. A typical flashlight consists of the light source mounted in a reflector, a transparent cover (sometimes combined with a lens) to protect the light source and reflector, a battery, and a switch, all enclosed in a case. The invention of the wet cell and miniature incandescent electric lamps made the first battery-powered flashlights possible around 1899. Today, flashlights use mostly light-emitting diodes and run on disposable or rechargeable batteries. Some are powered by the user turning a crank, shaking the lamp, or squeezing it. Some have solar panels to recharge the battery. Flashlights are used as a light source outdoors, in places without permanently installed lighting, during power outages, or when a portable light source is needed. In addition to the general-purpose, hand-held flashlight, many forms have been adapted for special uses. Head- or helmet-mounted flashlights designed for miners and campers leave the hands free. Some flashlights can be used under water or in flammable atmospheres.

These are not visible to the human eye, so ultraviolet energy is converted to visible light by the fluorescence of the inner phosphor coating. The difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon goes toward heating up the phosphor coating. Electric current flows through the tube in a low-pressure arc discharge. Electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma by the process of impact ionization. As a result of avalanche ionization, the

The company donated some of these devices to the New York City police, who responded favorably to them. Carbon-filament bulbs and fairly crude dry cells made early flashlights an expensive novelty, with low sales and low manufacturer interest. Development of the tungsten-filament lamp in 1904, with three times the efficacy of carbon filament types, and improved batteries, made flashlights more useful and popular. The advantage of instant control, and the absence of flame, meant that hand-held electric lights began to replace combustion-based lamps such as the hurricane lantern. By 1922 several types were available;

The company donated some of these devices to the New York City police, who responded favorably to them. Carbon-filament bulbs and fairly crude dry cells made early flashlights an expensive novelty, with low sales and low manufacturer interest. Development of the tungsten-filament lamp in 1904, with three times the efficacy of carbon filament types, and improved batteries, made flashlights more useful and popular. The advantage of instant control, and the absence of flame, meant that hand-held electric lights began to replace combustion-based lamps such as the hurricane lantern. By 1922 several types were available;

["Polar bears are the largest land carnivores in the world, and they are also the most efficient predators in the Arctic. These magnificent creatures have adapted to their environment in many ways, allowing them to survive in one of the harshest climates on Earth.\n\nOne of the most obvious adaptations of polar bears is their thick fur. Their fur is not just one layer, but two. The outer layer is made up of long, hollow hairs that help to insulate the bear from the cold. The inner layer is made up of shorter, thicker hairs that help to trap a layer of warm air close to the bear's skin. This double fur coat is one of the most important adaptations that allows polar bears to survive in the cold.\n\nAnother adaptation that helps polar bears to survive in the cold is their compact ears. Unlike other bears, polar bears have small ears that are close to their head. This helps to reduce heat loss from their ears, which can be a significant source of heat loss in other animals.\n\nPolar bears also have a number of other adaptations that help them to survive in the cold. For example, they have a thick layer of blubber, which helps to insulate them from the cold and provides them with energy during times when food is scarce. They also have a number of physiological adaptations, such as a high metabolic rate and a low body temperature", 'How do polar bears survive the cold?How do polar bears survive the cold?\nA.

  as Greenland shark, wolf fish, Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut and Arctic char must cope with the sub-zero temperatures in their waters. Some aquatic mammals, such as walrus, seal, sea lion, narwhals, beluga whales and killer whales, can store fat called blubber that they use to help keep warm in the icy waters. Some ungulates that live in frigid conditions often have pads under their hooves to help have a stronger tension on the icy ground or to help in climbing up on rocky terrain. But mammals that already have a pad under their foot such as polar bears, wolverines, Arctic wolves and Arctic foxes will have fur

  The Arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet, but they do not start to shiver until the temperature drops to -70 °C. Among its adaptations for survival in the cold is its dense, multilayered pelage, which provides excellent insulation. Additionally, the Arctic fox is the only canid whose foot pads are covered in fur. There are two genetically distinct coat color morphs: white and blue. The white morph has seasonal camouflage, white in winter and brown along the back with light grey around the abdomen in summer. The blue morph is often a dark blue, brown, or grey color year-round. Although the blue allele is dominant over the white allele, 99% of the Arctic fox population is the white morph. Two similar mutations to MC1R cause the blue color and the lack of seasonal color change. The fur of the Arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal. The fox has a low surface area to volume ratio, as evidenced by its generally compact body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the Arctic cold, less heat escapes from its body.

  Normally when colder conditions arrive, animals go into a state of suspended animation called hibernation, when they go into a state of inactivity for long periods of time, which they do not come out of until more suitable conditions for them to survive in arrive. However, when animals live in an environment that is inhospitable for much of the year, then hibernation is not necessary. One of the few animals that does so are lemmings, which have a mass migration after they come out of dormancy. However, most animals living in the arctic would still be active, even during the most brutal times of winter. Aquatic animals

  in the summer for breeding and many large fisheries. Due to ice melting and turning into ponds during summer, the ecosystem also sees insects including moths and mosquitoes. Some animals have adapted to the conditions in the region by conserving heat, with many species covered in heavy fur coats and having thick layers of fat beneath the skin while others have developed compact body shapes. They are characterized as having shorter legs and tails, and smaller ears compared to their relatives. Many species of animals have stiff fur on their feet to create a barrier between their pads and toes,

  The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years. Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm, with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat. The Arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings, voles, ringed seal pups, fish, waterfowl, and seabirds. It also eats carrion, berries, seaweed, and insects and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young. Natural predators of the Arctic fox are golden eagles, Arctic wolves, polar bears, wolverines, red foxes, and grizzly bears.

  American black bears have better eyesight and hearing than humans. Their keenest sense is their sense of smell, which is about seven times more sensitive than a domestic dog's. American black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, swimming for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies and hibernate. Four of the eight modern bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. They may be active at any time of the day or night, although they mainly forage by night. American black bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal,

  Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent. Despite being characterized as a danger primarily to young, spring neonatal ungulates in the first couple of days of life, when they have undeveloped legs and cannot run at full speed, young ungulates may be pursued well into summer or fall after they have developed running abilities. Most attacks on adult ungulates occur when the prey has some variety of physical disadvantage. When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose, whose hooves

 To improve the thermal insulation and heating properties of textiles, the structure of polar bear hair can be mimicked. Polar bear hair has hollow fibers that help them stay warm in extremely cold environments. By utilizing a technique called "freeze-spinning", synthetic fibers with aligned porous structure, similar to polar bear hairs, can be created on a large scale for textile fabrication.

The aligned porous structure of these biomimetic fibers allows for excellent thermal insulation properties in the resulting textile. This means that it can effectively prevent heat loss, keeping individuals warm in cold environments. Additionally, the textile maintains good breathability and wearability, making it comfortable to wear.

Furthermore, the biomimetic textile can also function as a wearable heater. By doping the textile with electroheating materials like carbon nanotubes, a fast thermal response and uniform electroheating can be induced. This means that the textile can actively generate heat, providing additional warmth to the wearer while still being soft and porous for comfort.

Overall, mimicking the structure of polar bear hair through freeze-spinning allows for the creation of textiles that offer excellent thermal insulation, breathability, and wearability. Additionally, by introducing electroheating materials, the textiles can also provide active heating capabilities.

['Dendrocygna autumnalis, commonly known as the West Indian whistling duck, is a species of duck that is found in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. These ducks are known for their distinctive whistling calls, which are used to communicate with each other.\n\nThe feet of Dendrocygna autumnalis are adapted for walking on land, rather than swimming or flying. They have webbed feet, which help them to walk on muddy or wet ground, but they are not particularly strong swimmers. These ducks are primarily terrestrial, and they spend most of their time on land, foraging for food and resting.\n\nIn terms of diet, Dendrocygna autumnalis feed on a variety of plant and animal matter, including seeds, fruits, and small invertebrates. They are also known to eat aquatic vegetation and small fish.\n\nOverall, the feet of Dendrocygna autumnalis are designed for walking and foraging on land, rather than for swimming or flying. While they are not particularly strong swimmers, they are still able to swim and dive when necessary, and they are capable of flying short distances to escape danger or to move between different bodies of water.', 'What are the feet of Dendrocygna autumnalis designed for?What are the feet of Dendrocygna autumnalis designed for?\nA. catching prey\nB. aquatic speed\nC. flying\nD. walking']

  The white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala) is a small diving duck some 45 cm long. The male has a white head with black crown, a blue bill, and reddish-grey plumage. The female has a dark bill and rather duller colouring. Its breeding habitat is lakes with open water and dense vegetation at the margin. It dives under water and feeds on aquatic vegetation as well as some animal matter. It is more likely to swim away from a perceived threat than to fly. This duck is known from Spain, North Africa, Western Asia and Central Asia. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and pollution, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's status as "endangered".

  Waders (called shorebirds in North America) are associated with the tidal variations in water level. They are found in mudflats which are exposed at low tide and or just about underwater in very shallow waters, where they search for their Benthos preys in the mud. Their thin, pointed beaks penetrate the mud to catch preys which do not have significant reactions. Their short legs allow them to walk where the water is only a few centimetres deep. Their legs and beaks are often brightly coloured, but their prey cannot see them and flee. During high tides, when their food is underwater, they rest at Roost sites. Some species feed throughout the tidal cycle shifting their feeding between mudflats and saltmarshes in synchrony with the tide rises and falls. The loss of mudflats and saltmarshes and

  This species is associated with large swamps, permanent dam impoundments, ponds, and lakes (particularly ones with reeds) in woodland, shrubland, open and coastal areas. This frog is an agile climber, but is most often found among dense reeds or along swampy grasslands. It hunts and basks in the sun during the day. Growling grass frogs reportedly hunt other frogs by zoning into the sound of their calls. The call is a three part moaning "craw-ork ar-ar", rising and then falling in tone (described as the sound of a duck or goose being strangled). The males develop black, rough nuptial pads on their thumbs during the breeding season, which occurs during spring although to late summer. Females have the ability to hiss when threatened. The eggs (up to several thousand) are distributed in a loose pile. These frogs stay in tadpole stage for at least one year. This frog is believed to be in decline across much of its range. In some regions, it has disappeared altogether, but in others it remains locally abundant (such as parts of northern Victoria and the Riverland in South Australia, associated with the Murray River).

['In order for your computer to operate, it must have an electrical path that is open. This path allows for the flow of electricity from the power source to the various components within the computer. Without this open path, the computer would not be able to function properly.\n\nThe electrical path in a computer is created by a series of conductive materials, such as copper wires and printed circuit boards. These materials allow for the flow of electrons, which are the building blocks of electricity.\n\nThe path begins at the power source, which is typically an external power supply or a wall outlet. The power source provides a steady flow of electrical energy, which is then distributed to the various components within the computer.\n\nThe electrical path is not a single, uninterrupted line. Instead, it is made up of a series of interconnected components, such as capacitors, resistors, and transistors. These components work together to control the flow of electricity and ensure that it is delivered to the correct components at the correct time.\n\nIn order for the electrical path to function properly, it must be free from any obstructions or interruptions. This is achieved through the use of insulating materials, such as rubber or plastic, which prevent the flow of electricity from being disrupted.\n\nIn summary, the electrical path in a computer is what allows for the flow of electricity from the power source to the various components within the computer.

  to make. The use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in real time (or faster), at a speed determined mostly by the frequency response of the operational amplifiers and other computing elements. In the history of electronic analog computers, there were some special high-speed types. Nonlinear functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing function generators—special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the input voltage increases, progressively more diodes conduct. When compensated for temperature, the forward voltage drop of a transistor's base-emitter junction can provide

Electrical elements such as inductors and capacitors used in electrical analog computers had to be carefully manufactured to reduce non-ideal effects.

  Electronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections that define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there is usually a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes. Typical electronic analog computers contain anywhere from a few to a hundred or more operational amplifiers ("op amps"), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are a particular type of feedback amplifier with very high gain

  A common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire. With a low resistance in the connection, a high current will flow, causing the delivery of a large amount of energy in a short period of time. A high current flowing through a battery can cause a rapid increase of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion with the release of hydrogen gas and electrolyte (an acid or a base), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires will also overheat causing damage to the wire's insulation, or starting a

  An isolation transformer is a transformer used to transfer electrical power from a source of alternating current (AC) power to some equipment or device while isolating the powered device from the power source, usually for safety reasons. Isolation transformers provide galvanic isolation; no conductive path is present between source and load. This isolation is used to protect against electric shock, to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. A transformer sold for isolation is often built with special insulation between primary and secondary, and is specified to withstand a high voltage between windings. Isolation transformers block transmission of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allow AC components in signals to pass. Transformers that have a ratio of 1 to 1 between the primary and secondary windings are often used to protect secondary circuits and individuals from electrical shocks between energized conductors and earth ground. Suitably designed isolation transformers block interference caused by ground loops. Isolation transformers with electrostatic shields are used for power supplies for sensitive equipment such as computers, medical devices, or laboratory instruments.

   An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task. The components in an electric circuit can take many forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli. The resistor is perhaps the simplest

  example, the dynamics of a spring-mass system can be described by the equation (position), one inverter, and three potentiometers. Electronic analog computers have drawbacks: the value of the circuit's supply voltage limits the range over which the variables may vary (since the value of a variable is represented by a voltage on a particular wire). Therefore, each problem must be scaled so its parameters and dimensions can be represented using voltages that the circuit can supply —e.g., the expected magnitudes of the velocity and the position of a spring pendulum. Improperly scaled variables can have their values "clamped" by the

   An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow. To be referred to as electronic, rather than electrical, generally at least one active component must be present. The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another. Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate

 Finally, VT may be induced with as little as 50–100 mA if the current flows through the heart.As the current increases beyond 20 mA, respiratory muscle paralysis sets in if the current flows through these muscles.Skeletal muscle tetany can be powerful enough to cause fractures during the spasm.The pain the burn patient experiences is extraordinary and often requires multiple doses of pain medication to achieve a reduction in pain level because the patient's metabolism has increased from the burn process and the anxiety. In addition, absorption is altered because of fluid shifts, so intravenous or intraosseous administration is required. Begin with 1 mg/kg fentanyl or 10 mg morphine sulfate and consult medical control for further orders. ## Electrical Burns

Electrical burns are a difficult burn to assess because much of the damage is internal. For an electrical burn to happen, the electricity must complete a circuit by entering the body and then flowing into another wire or the ground. When the circuit is completed, the electricity flows into the body from the point of contact with the live electrical source until it exits the body. High-voltage electrical current, such as that from outdoor electrical supply lines will follow the shortest path to the nearest conductor or the ground. Lower voltage sources under 1,000 V, such as household interior wiring, will usually take the path of least resistance to electrical flow, which is usually nerves and blood vessels. Between the entry and exit wounds, electricity produces immense heat from the natural resistance of human tissue to electricity. The electricity also will cause skeletal muscle tetany, freezing a person in position connected to the electricity source if the current is high enough. Skeletal muscle tetany can be powerful enough to cause fractures during the spasm. As the current increases beyond 20 mA, respiratory muscle paralysis sets in if the current flows through these muscles. Finally, VT may be induced with as little as 50–100 mA if the current flows through the heart.There are 3 types of electrical injury:

  * **True Electrical Burns.** This is the most common form and occurs when electricity flows directly into the body from a source and into another conductor or the ground.* **Arc Burns.** These most often come from extremely high-voltage wires.

["The common cold is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, throat, and sinuses. It is caused by a variety of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. The symptoms of a cold typically include a runny nose, congestion, coughing, and sneezing. The body's immune system responds to the infection by producing an inflammatory response, which can lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches.\n\nThe immune system's response to the cold virus involves the activation of white blood cells, specifically T cells and B cells. T cells help to coordinate the immune response and destroy infected cells, while B cells produce antibodies that can neutralize the virus. However, the immune response can also cause damage to healthy tissue, leading to symptoms such as inflammation and congestion.\n\nIn addition to white blood cells, the body's response to the cold virus can also be impacted by other factors. For example, vitamin C has been shown to help boost the immune system's response to the virus, while nasal decongestants can help to alleviate symptoms such as congestion. However, the use of nasal decongestants can also have negative impacts on the body, as they can lead to rebound congestion and other side effects.\n\nOverall, the body", 'The body is negatively impacted byThe body is negatively impacted by\nA. white blood cells\nB. vitamins\nC. rotavirus\nD. nasal decongestants']

  One of the most common diseases caused by door handle bacteria is the common cold. Since the virus is spread mostly by direct contact with an object or surface that has been contaminated by the infection and then touching our face, the everyday dangers are obvious. The symptoms become apparent a few days after the patient is infected and the following ones are the most recognizable: sore throat, runny nose, cough and sneezing. A statistic shows that on average 13,738,175 people in the United Kingdom suffer from common cold. By this number Britain has the largest number of infections of all countries in Western Europe.

  Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way into the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia.

  Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or

  Cold sensitivity or cold intolerance is unusual discomfort felt by some people when in a cool environment. There is much variation in the sensitivity to cold experienced by different people, with some putting on many layers of clothing while others in the same environment feel comfortable in one layer. Cold sensitivity may be a symptom of hypothyroidism, anemia, fibromyalgia or vasoconstriction. Also, a lack of vitamin B12 can cause a constantly feeling cold. There are other conditions that may cause a cold intolerance, including low body weight, high body temperature and low blood pressure. There may also be differences in people in the expression of uncoupling proteins, thus affecting their amount of thermogenesis. Psychology may also play a factor in perceived temperature.

  A sneeze (also known as sternutation) is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa. A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action. This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity. Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light, sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, exposure to allergens, or viral infection. Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or

Chronic fatigue syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and treat. If symptoms persist after one month of self-treatment, seek medical help with a doctor who specializes in the treatment of patients with chronic fatigue. ### **_Colds and Flu_**

There's no getting around it: you're going to get sick—often—as you face a lifetime of building a strong immune system. More than two hundred different viruses cause colds and flu, and you have to build immunity to them one by one. That's why kids catch six to ten colds a year, and adults come down with two to four annually. Technically speaking, a cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, sinuses, and bronchial tubes. When confronted with the viral invaders, the nose and throat release chemicals to stoke up the immune system. The affected cells produce prostaglandins, which stimulate inflammation and lure the infection-fighting white blood cells. The body temperature rises to boost the immune response and more nasal mucus is produced to trap and wash away viral particles. Both the common cold and the flu involve general malaise, upper-respiratory-tract congestion, sneezing, fever, sore throat, and runny nose.The flu involves the cold symptoms, plus chills, fatigue, red eyes, and sore muscles.Nausea and vomiting may also occur.While your doctor can prescribe medication to shorten the duration of the flu if infected, in most cases all you need to do is treat the symptoms and allow the virus to run its course.

 The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.

There is no vaccine for the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses, and there is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Under normal circumstances, the average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. Infections occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have existed throughout human history.

Signs and symptoms

The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle ache likewise in about 50%. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.

The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.

Progression
A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.

Causes

Viruses

The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds.

Transmission
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base.

Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.

Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards.

Weather
A common misconception is that one can "catch a cold" simply through prolonged exposure to cold weather. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer.

The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature (hypothermia) may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection.

Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.

Pathophysiology

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the symptoms of croup due to the small size of their airways.

Diagnosis
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.

Prevention
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures such as using correct hand washing technique and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Vaccination has proven difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, therefore, highly improbable.

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.

It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.

Management

Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect.  no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.

Symptomatic
Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.

In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Ipratropium may also help with cough in adults. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.

Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.

Zinc

Zinc supplements may shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell. A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons; whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.

Alternative medicine

While there are many alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines supposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their use. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products or garlic provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.

Vitamins C and D

Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.

Prognosis
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. In children, half of cases go away in 10 days and 90% in 15 days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.

Epidemiology
The common cold is the most common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.

Native Americans and Inuit are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians. This may be explained as much by issues such as poverty and overcrowding as by ethnicity.

History

While the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.

In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.

Research directions
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. Double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO), a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as other infectious viruses.

The genomes of all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced.

Societal impact
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.

 The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.

There is no vaccine for the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses, and there is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Under normal circumstances, the average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. Infections occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have existed throughout human history.

Signs and symptoms

The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle ache likewise in about 50%. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.

The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.

Progression
A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.

Causes

Viruses

The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds.

Transmission
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base.

Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.

Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards.

Weather
A common misconception is that one can "catch a cold" simply through prolonged exposure to cold weather. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer.

The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature (hypothermia) may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection.

Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.

Pathophysiology

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the symptoms of croup due to the small size of their airways.

Diagnosis
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.

Prevention
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures such as using correct hand washing technique and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Vaccination has proven difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, therefore, highly improbable.

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.

It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.

Management

Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect.  no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.

Symptomatic
Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.

In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Ipratropium may also help with cough in adults. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.

Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.

Zinc

Zinc supplements may shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell. A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons; whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.

Alternative medicine

While there are many alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines supposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their use. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products or garlic provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.

Vitamins C and D

Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.

Prognosis
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. In children, half of cases go away in 10 days and 90% in 15 days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.

Epidemiology
The common cold is the most common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.

Native Americans and Inuit are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians. This may be explained as much by issues such as poverty and overcrowding as by ethnicity.

History

While the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.

In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.

Research directions
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. Double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO), a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as other infectious viruses.

The genomes of all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced.

Societal impact
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.

Since the precise cause of chronic fatigue syndrome has not been identified, no specific steps can be taken to avoid it. In general, maintaining a strong immune system helps ward off the condition. #### CALL FOR HELP

Chronic fatigue syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and treat. If symptoms persist after one month of self-treatment, seek medical help with a doctor who specializes in the treatment of patients with chronic fatigue. ### **_Colds and Flu_**

There's no getting around it: you're going to get sick—often—as you face a lifetime of building a strong immune system. More than two hundred different viruses cause colds and flu, and you have to build immunity to them one by one. That's why kids catch six to ten colds a year, and adults come down with two to four annually. Technically speaking, a cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, sinuses, and bronchial tubes. When confronted with the viral invaders, the nose and throat release chemicals to stoke up the immune system. The affected cells produce prostaglandins, which stimulate inflammation and lure the infection-fighting white blood cells. The body temperature rises to boost the immune response and more nasal mucus is produced to trap and wash away viral particles. Both the common cold and the flu involve general malaise, upper-respiratory-tract congestion, sneezing, fever, sore throat, and runny nose.The flu involves the cold symptoms, plus chills, fatigue, red eyes, and sore muscles.Nausea and vomiting may also occur.While your doctor can prescribe medication to shorten the duration of the flu if infected, in most cases all you need to do is treat the symptoms and allow the virus to run its course.
 2 -8.46287  A sneeze (also known as sternutation) is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa. A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action. This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity. Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light, sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, exposure to allergens, or viral infection. Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or 
 3 -8.80426  Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way into the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia.
 4 -9.30033 The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.

There is no vaccine for the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses, and there is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Under normal circumstances, the average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. Infections occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have existed throughout human history.

Signs and symptoms

The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle ache likewise in about 50%. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.

The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.

Progression
A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.

Causes

Viruses

The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds.

Transmission
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base.

Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.

Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards.

Weather
A common misconception is that one can "catch a cold" simply through prolonged exposure to cold weather. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer.

The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature (hypothermia) may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection.

Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.

Pathophysiology

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the symptoms of croup due to the small size of their airways.

Diagnosis
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.

Prevention
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures such as using correct hand washing technique and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Vaccination has proven difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, therefore, highly improbable.

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.

It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.

Management

Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect.  no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.

Symptomatic
Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.

In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Ipratropium may also help with cough in adults. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.

Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.

Zinc

Zinc supplements may shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell. A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons; whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.

Alternative medicine

While there are many alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines supposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their use. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products or garlic provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.

Vitamins C and D

Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.

Prognosis
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. In children, half of cases go away in 10 days and 90% in 15 days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.

Epidemiology
The common cold is the most common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.

Native Americans and Inuit are more likely to be infected with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians. This may be explained as much by issues such as poverty and overcrowding as by ethnicity.

History

While the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.

In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.

Research directions
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. Double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO), a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as other infectious viruses.

The genomes of all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced.

Societal impact
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.

 5 -9.30033 The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.

There is no vaccine for the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses, and there is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Under normal circumstances, the average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. Infections occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have existed throughout human history.

Signs and symptoms

The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle ache likewise in about 50%. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.

The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.

Progression
A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.

Causes

Viruses

The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds.

Transmission
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base.

Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.

Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards.

Weather
A common misconception is that one can "catch a cold" simply through prolonged exposure to cold weather. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer.

The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature (hypothermia) may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection.

Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.

Pathophysiology

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the symptoms of croup due to the small size of their airways.

Diagnosis
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.

Prevention
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures such as using correct hand washing technique and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Vaccination has proven difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, therefore, highly improbable.

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.

It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.

Management

Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect.  no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.

Symptomatic
Treatments that may help with symptoms include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.

In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Ipratropium may also help with cough in adults. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.

Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.

Zinc

Zinc supplements may shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell. A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons; whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.

Alternative medicine

While there are many alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines supposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their use. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products or garlic provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.

Vitamins C and D

Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.

Prognosis
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. In children, half of cases go away in 10 days and 90% in 15 days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.

Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.

There's no getting around it: you're going to get sick—often—as you face a lifetime of building a strong immune system. Technically speaking, a cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, sinuses, and bronchial tubes. When confronted with the viral invaders, the nose and throat release chemicals to stoke up the immune system. The affected cells produce prostaglandins, which stimulate inflammation and lure the infection-fighting white blood cells. The body temperature rises to boost the immune response and more nasal mucus is produced to trap and wash away viral particles. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress.

  * _Coenzyme Q10_ boosts the immune system. * _Astragalus_ strengthens the immune system. * _Acidophilus_ restores "good" bacteria in those with candida infection, a common cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. Take 1 to 2 billion CFU daily. #### AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

Since the precise cause of chronic fatigue syndrome has not been identified, no specific steps can be taken to avoid it. In general, maintaining a strong immune system helps ward off the condition. #### CALL FOR HELP

Chronic fatigue syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and treat. ### **_Colds and Flu_**

There's no getting around it: you're going to get sick—often—as you face a lifetime of building a strong immune system. Technically speaking, a cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, sinuses, and bronchial tubes. When confronted with the viral invaders, the nose and throat release chemicals to stoke up the immune system. The affected cells produce prostaglandins, which stimulate inflammation and lure the infection-fighting white blood cells. The body temperature rises to boost the immune response and more nasal mucus is produced to trap and wash away viral particles. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection. Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself. Pathophysiology

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. Diagnosis
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Management

Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect. It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful. In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. Vitamins C and D

Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity. History

While the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. Societal impact
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. References

['Carbon steel is a type of steel that contains carbon as its primary alloying element. It is a popular material for manufacturing various products due to its strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness. However, carbon steel is not magnetic by nature.

This is because carbon steel does not contain any magnetic material, such as iron or nickel, in sufficient quantities to create a magnetic field.\n\nIn fact, carbon steel is often used to make non-magnetic components for magnetic devices, such as transformers and motors. This is because carbon steel is resistant to corrosion and can withstand harsh environments, making it an ideal choice for these applications.\n\nHowever, carbon steel can be magnetized through various processes, such as induction or permanent magnetization. This can be useful for certain applications, such as in the manufacturing of magnetic sensors or in the creation of magnetic shielding.\n\nIn summary, carbon steel is not magnetic by nature, but it can be magnetized through various processes for specific applications.', 'Carbon steel is always what?Carbon steel is always what?\nA. attractive to various objects that contain iron\nB. pleasant with a magnetic personality\nC. made up of iron and pieces of magnets\nD. hard as a magnetizing rod']

  Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term alloy steel usually only refers to steels that contain other elements— like vanadium, molybdenum, or cobalt—in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the Age of reason, the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of Sheffield, a center of steel production in England,

   A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include the elements iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some

  Many materials have unpaired electron spins, and the majority of these materials are paramagnetic. When the spins interact with each other in such a way that the spins align spontaneously, the materials are called ferromagnetic (what is often loosely termed as magnetic). Because of the way their regular crystalline atomic structure causes their spins to interact, some metals are ferromagnetic when found in their natural states, as ores. These include iron ore (magnetite or lodestone), cobalt and nickel, as well as the rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium (when at a very low temperature). Such naturally occurring ferromagnets were used in the first experiments with magnetism. Technology has since expanded the availability of magnetic materials to include various man-made products, all based, however, on naturally magnetic elements.

 Carbon films with vertically aligned nano-crystallites have shown potential applications in magnetic sensing devices. These films, obtained through a plasma-assisted physical vapor deposition (PVD) method, exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetism and magnetoresistance, making them suitable as magnetic sensitive materials. The spin-orbital interactions at the graphene edges and temperature-dependent carrier transport properties are responsible for these magnetic properties.

The carbon-based sensing devices built on these films have demonstrated their capabilities to work in the temperature range of 250-400 K. They can respond to external magnetic fields with different intensities and relative angles to the film's surface. The minimum field intensity to which the device can respond is 1 mT, and the minimum angle change is 2°. With substrate-introduced enhancement, the maximum changing rate of the film resistance can reach up to 1100%/T. 

Overall, the potential applications of carbon films with vertically aligned nano-crystallites in magnetic sensing devices include but are not limited to:

1. Magnetic field sensors: These carbon films can be used to measure and detect magnetic fields with high sensitivity and accuracy.

2. Position sensors: By analyzing the changes in resistance or magnetoresistance of the film, these sensors can determine the position or displacement of objects in magnetic fields.

3. Magnetic imaging: The carbon films can be used in imaging techniques to visualize and analyze the magnetic fields in various applications such as medical imaging or non-destructive testing.

4. Magnetic storage devices: The unique magnetic properties of these carbon films make them potential candidates for improving magnetic storage technologies, such as hard drives or magnetic tapes.

These applications demonstrate the practical and simple nature of using PVD carbon films in magnetic sensing devices, offering low-cost and easily obtainable solutions for various industries and applications.

 Scalpel blades are commonly made of materials such as hardened and tempered steel, stainless steel, or high carbon steel. However, when performing surgery under MRI guidance, steel blades would be unsuitable due to their magnetic properties. The strong magnetic field generated by the MRI machine would cause the steel blades to be drawn towards the magnets, potentially causing harm to the patient or disrupting the surgical procedure. Additionally, steel blades can also cause image artifacts in MRI scans.

To address this issue, alternative materials are used for scalpel blades in MRI-guided surgeries. These materials include titanium, ceramic, diamond, and even obsidian knives. These materials are non-magnetic and do not interfere with the MRI machine's magnetic field or produce image artifacts.

It is worth noting that historically, silver was a preferred material for surgical scalpels. However, modern advancements have led to the development of various other materials that offer improved sharpness and edge retention. Some manufacturers now offer scalpel blades with a zirconium nitride-coated edge or polymer-coated blades to enhance sharpness and lubricity during a cut.

In surgical applications where scalpels may not be suitable or desired, alternatives such as electrocautery and lasers can be used. These techniques provide precise cutting without the need for physical blades.

Overall, it is important to select appropriate materials for scalpel blades based on the specific requirements of each surgical procedure. In cases where MRI guidance is involved, non-magnetic materials like titanium or ceramic are utilized to ensure patient safety and accurate imaging during surgery.

 Low-temperature nitriding can enhance the mechanical and magnetic properties of stainless steel and magnetic encoders in several ways. In the specific case of a magnetic encoder made from 304L stainless steel, low-temperature nitriding at 400°C has been found to have positive effects.

Firstly, low-temperature nitriding can induce stress-induced and strain-induced transformations of the austenite in stainless steel. The presence of ε- and α'-martensite in the deformed microstructure indicates these transformations. This transformation can lead to an increase in hardness and wear resistance of the stainless steel.

Secondly, the nitriding process results in the formation of a nitride layer on the surface of the stainless steel. This nitride layer, composed of γN and α'N (expanded austenite and martensite), exhibits a high concentration of nitrogen. The high surface hardness of this nitride layer improves the wear and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel, making it more durable in various applications.

In the case of the magnetic encoder, the low-temperature nitriding process improves both the mechanical and magnetic properties. By incorporating the information into the stainless steel itself through the transformation of austenite to martensite, the encoder achieves precise positioning without the need for turning grooves. Additionally, the appearance of a non-magnetic phase due to the α' → γ transformation can be controlled through laser surface treatment.

Overall, low-temperature nitriding enhances the mechanical properties of stainless steel, such as hardness and wear resistance, while maintaining or improving its magnetic properties. This can lead to improved performance and durability of stainless steel components, including magnetic encoders.

  Martensite is formed in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of the austenite form of iron at such a high rate that carbon atoms do not have time to diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe3C).

As a result of the quenching, the face-centered cubic austenite transforms to a highly strained body-centered tetragonal form called martensite that is supersaturated with carbon.

 When it comes to comparing the efficiency of instruments, such as in the case of stainless steel and carbon steel, it is important to consider various factors. Both stainless steel and carbon steel have advantages and disadvantages that can impact their performance in different situations.

Stainless steel is often preferred for its corrosion resistance and ability to maintain its appearance over time. This makes it suitable for applications where maintaining the instrument's aesthetics is important, such as in the medical field or in culinary tools. Additionally, stainless steel instruments are generally easy to clean and sterilize, which is crucial in medical settings to prevent the spread of infections.

On the other hand, carbon steel instruments have properties that can offer advantages in certain situations. Carbon steel is generally harder and stronger than stainless steel, which can make it more efficient for tasks that require durability and resistance to wear. This can be particularly beneficial in high-impact applications, like heavy-duty cutting tools or machining equipment.

Furthermore, carbon steel may be more cost-effective compared to stainless steel, which is typically more expensive due to its corrosion-resistant properties.

Ultimately, the choice between stainless steel and carbon steel instruments depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. While stainless steel is often preferred for its corrosion resistance and easy maintenance, carbon steel can be more efficient for heavy-duty applications that require durability and strength.

Please note that this response is based on general knowledge in the field of materials and does not constitute specific advice or recommendations for choosing between stainless steel and carbon steel instruments. It's always important to consider the specific needs and requirements of the intended application, as well as consulting with professionals or experts in the field.

  Usually metal furniture is made from either steel or aluminum. To tell aluminum from steel, place a magnet on a metal surface and if it is steel it will stick. Steel furniture is typically pricier when it is used as furniture, with the price varying according to the type of metal and thickness. However, it is hard to identify it after a finish is applied. Steel has low, medium or high carbon, with most metal furniture being made with low carbon because it is cheaper than a higher grade of carbon. Stainless steel is good for low maintenance. Made of an alloy of carbon, iron and other metals, its main reason for its strength is because of chromium, which protects from rust and corrosion because of its

  As austenite cools, the carbon diffuses out of the austenite and forms carbon-rich iron-carbide (cementite) and leaves behind carbon-poor ferrite. Depending on alloy composition, a layering of ferrite and cementite, called pearlite, may form. If the rate of cooling is very swift, the carbon does not have time enough to diffuse and the alloy may experience a large lattice distortion known as martensitic transformation in which it transforms into martensite, a body centered tetragonal structure (BCT).The rate of cooling determines the relative proportions of martensite, ferrite, and cementite, and therefore determines the mechanical properties of the resulting steel, such as hardness and tensile strength. A high cooling rate of thick sections will cause a steep thermal gradient in the material. The outer layers of the heat treated part will cool faster and shrink more, causing it to be under tension and thermal staining. At high cooling

 4 -9.05905   A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include the elements iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some 
 5 -9.50456 Carbon films with vertically aligned nano-crystallites have shown potential applications in magnetic sensing devices. These films, obtained through a plasma-assisted physical vapor deposition (PVD) method, exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetism and magnetoresistance, making them suitable as magnetic sensitive materials. The spin-orbital interactions at the graphene edges and temperature-dependent carrier transport properties are responsible for these magnetic properties.

The carbon-based sensing devices built on these films have demonstrated their capabilities to work in the temperature range of 250-400 K. They can respond to external magnetic fields with different intensities and relative angles to the film's surface. The minimum field intensity to which the device can respond is 1 mT, and the minimum angle change is 2°. With substrate-introduced enhancement, the maximum changing rate of the film resistance can reach up to 1100%/T. 

Overall, the potential applications of carbon films with vertically aligned nano-crystallites in magnetic sensing devices include but are not limited to:

1. Magnetic field sensors: These carbon films can be used to measure and detect magnetic fields with high sensitivity and accuracy.

2. Position sensors: By analyzing the changes in resistance or magnetoresistance of the film, these sensors can determine the position or displacement of objects in magnetic fields.

3. Magnetic imaging: The carbon films can be used in imaging techniques to visualize and analyze the magnetic fields in various applications such as medical imaging or non-destructive testing.

4. Magnetic storage devices: The unique magnetic properties of these carbon films make them potential candidates for improving magnetic storage technologies, such as hard drives or magnetic tapes.

These applications demonstrate the practical and simple nature of using PVD carbon films in magnetic sensing devices, offering low-cost and easily obtainable solutions for various industries and applications.

['Bats are mammals that are found all over the world. They are the only mammals capable of sustained flight. Bats are nocturnal and have excellent hearing and echolocation abilities. They are also known for their unique reproductive system. Unlike most mammals, female bats give birth to a single offspring, which is born fully formed and capable of flying. This is known as viviparity. The gestation period for bats varies depending on the species, but typically ranges from 50 to 150 days. After birth, the young bat is completely dependent on its mother for several weeks. During this time, the mother bat will nurse and protect her young. After several weeks, the young bat will begin to fly and become more independent. Bats are important pollinators and seed dispersers, and they play a crucial role in many ecosystems. However, they are also threatened by habitat loss, disease, and human activity.\n\nIn terms of the question, if a bat delivers a live offspring, this tells us that bats are capable of reproducing. This is an important characteristic of mammals, as they are the only class of animals that give birth to live young.', 'if a bat delivers a live offspring, what does this tell us?if a bat delivers a live offspring, what does this tell us?\nA. it is a mammal\nB. calling it a bird is wrong\nC. all of these\nD. it is capable of reproducing']

  hibernation and spring migration. Adult mortality is especially high during spring migration, as bats that do not have sufficient fat reserves have difficulties surviving the stress and energy-intensive migration period. After copulation, females store sperm in their uteri, ovulating only after they have emerged from hibernation. Gestation in gray bats lasts 60 to 70 days, with birth occurring in late May and early June. Gray bat females give birth to one offspring per clutch (bout of reproduction), thus giving birth to one offspring per year. Therefore, gray bats demonstrate an iteroparous life-history strategy. The young clings to the mother for about a week, after which they remain in the maternity colony until they are able to fly. Most young take flight by four weeks of age (late June to mid-July).

  The uterine horns open into the vagina through separate vaginal canals, forming a uterus duplex. The placenta also lacks a hemophagous area, a structure which aids in endocytosis and digestion of erythrocytes. The gestation period varies depending on climate, lasting 2–3 months in tropical areas, while lasting up to 5 months in temperate climates. At birth, this species weighs about 50% of the mother’s weight. The females fly, carrying their young, between roosts to keep them safe from predators.

  During the breeding season, late October to early November, female bats congregate in groups and give birth to a single young. The generation length is estimated at four years. According to a study conducted on range of ghost bats in Australia, “female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% for females greater than 2 years old”. Maternity colonies are founded in large and open caves and occupied until the young are reared. The teats are evident in females during the maternity season. The possession of anterior teats allows the new born to cling to the mother until the milk teeth are shed. The young are born in the austral spring, are able to fly after seven weeks, and become fully weaned at sixteen weeks. As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. The males play no part in the rearing of young. The juvenile hunts with the mother until reaching an independent stage of its maturity.

  The bats are nocturnal, and are often caught over water, where they feed primarily on beetles, bugs, and Hymenopteran insects. To a lesser extent, they also feed on soft-bodied insects, such as moths, flies, and Neuropterans. They use frequency modulated narrow band calls with a frequency that ranges from 27 to 44 kHz. During the day, they roost in rock crevices. Roosts may harbour up to ten bats, which are often clustered together into smaller, tightly packed groups of up to four individuals each. Pregnant females have been observed in November, but nothing further is known of their reproductive biology and life cycle.

 In most species of mammals, milk production is primarily a function of female individuals. Lactation, which is the secretion of milk from the mammary glands, naturally occurs in female mammals after pregnancy to provide nutrition and immune protection to their young. This process is commonly referred to as nursing or breastfeeding. 

However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule. In humans and goats, both males and females are capable of producing milk. This is due to certain hormonal imbalances, such as hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to milk production unrelated to nursing, a condition known as galactorrhea. Additionally, in the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, milk production is a normal male function.

The production and maintenance of milk involves a complex interplay of hormones. Galactopoiesis, which is the maintenance of milk production, relies on the hormone prolactin. Oxytocin is crucial for the milk let-down reflex, which is the process of milk being released in response to suckling.

The primary purpose of lactation is to provide essential nutrition and immune protection to the offspring after birth. This enables the mother-young pair to survive even in conditions where food may be scarce or difficult for the young to obtain. Lactation also has the effect of inducing a period of infertility, known as lactational amenorrhea in humans, which helps to ensure optimal birth spacing for the survival of the offspring.

In conclusion, while milk production is typically a normal function of female individuals in most mammal species, there are some exceptions, such as in humans, goats, and the Dayak fruit bat. These exceptional cases involve various hormonal influences and can result in milk production in both males and females.

  Male lesser mouse-tailed bats mature at sixteen to seventeen months of age. Female bats become sexually mature at nine months of age and are monestrous i.e. they have one oestrus cycle per year. The mating season is generally in the months of February to April. Gestation lasts from 95 to 100 days and only one offspring is produced in a brood, usually in June–July. The young bats take flight at the age of five to six weeks.

 The bat virome is the group of viruses associated with bats. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae.

Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic, or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano, or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host. There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated.

Despite the abundance of viruses associated with bats, they rarely become ill from viral infections, and rabies is the only viral illness known to kill bats. Much research has been conducted on bat virology, particularly bat immune response. Bats' immune systems differ from other mammals in their lack of several inflammasomes, which activate the body's inflammatory response, as well as a dampened stimulator of interferon genes (STING) response, which helps control host response to pathogens. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. A 2015 review found that bats do not harbor more zoonotic viruses than primates or rodents, though the three groups harbored more than other mammal orders. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals.

Viral diversity

Viruses have been found in bat populations around the world. Bats harbor all groups of viruses in the Baltimore classification, representing at least 28 families of viruses. Most of the viruses harbored by bats are RNA viruses, though they are also known to have DNA viruses. Bats are more tolerant of viruses than terrestrial mammals. A single bat can host several different kinds of viruses without becoming ill. Bats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity. Their behavior and life history also make them "exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement.

Though bats harbor diverse viruses, they are rarely lethal to the bat host. Only the rabies virus and a few other lyssaviruses have been confirmed to kill bats. Various factors have been implicated in bats' ability to survive viral infections. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Flight produces a fever-like response, resulting in elevated temperature (up to ) and metabolic rate. Additionally, this fever-like response may help them cope with actual fevers upon getting a viral infection. Some research indicates that bats' immune systems have allowed them to cope with a variety of viruses. A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened STING response compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. STING is a signaling molecule that helps coordinate various host defense genes against pathogens. The authors of the study concluded that "the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses."

Additionally, bats lack several inflammasomes found in other mammals; other inflammasomes are present with a greatly reduced response. While inflammation is an immune response to viruses, excessive inflammation is damaging to the body, and viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are known to kill humans by inducing excessive inflammation. Bats' immune systems may have evolved to be more tolerant of stressors such as viral infections compared to other mammals.

Transmission to humans

The vast majority of bat viruses have no zoonotic potential, meaning they cannot be transmitted to humans. The zoonotic viruses have four possible routes of transmission to humans: contact with bat body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, feces); intermediate hosts; environmental exposure; and blood-feeding arthropods. Lyssaviruses like the rabies virus are transmitted from bats to humans via biting. Transmission of most other viruses does not appear to take place via biting, however. Contact with bat fluids such as guano, urine, and saliva is an important source of spillover from bats to humans. Other mammals may play a role in transmitting bat viruses to people, with pig farms a source of bat-borne viruses in Malaysia and Australia. Other possible transmission routes of bat-borne viruses are more speculative. It is possible but unconfirmed that hunting, butchering, and consuming bat meat can result in viral spillover. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. There is little evidence of environmental transmission of viruses from bats to humans, meaning that bat-borne virus do not persist in the environment for long. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the subject.

Bats compared to other viral reservoirs
Bats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal orders, an example of research bias. A 2015 review found that from 1999 to 2013, there were 300–1200 papers published about bat viruses annually, compared to 12–45 publications for marsupial viruses and only 1–9 studies for sloth viruses. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). A 2020 review of mammals and birds found that the identity of the taxonomic groups did not have any impact on the probability of harboring zoonotic viruses. Instead, more diverse groups had greater viral diversity. Bat life history traits and immunity, while likely influential in determining bat viral communities, were not associated with a greater probability of viral spillover into humans.

Sampling
Bats are sampled for viruses in a variety of ways. They can be tested for seropositivity for a given virus using a method like ELISA, which determines whether or not they have the corresponding antibodies for the virus. They can also be surveyed using molecular detection techniques like PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which can be used to replicate and amplify viral sequences. Histopathology, which is the microscopic examination of tissue, can also be used. Viruses have been isolated from bat blood, saliva, feces, tissue, and urine. Some sampling is non-invasive and does not require killing the bat for sampling, whereas other sampling requires sacrificing the animal first. A 2016 review found no significant difference in total number of viruses found and new viruses discovered between lethal and non-lethal studies. Several species of threatened bat have been killed for viral sampling, including the Comoro rousette, Hildegarde's tomb bat, Natal free-tailed bat, and the long-fingered bat.

Double-stranded DNA viruses

Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses have been detected in bat guano, urine, and oral and rectal swabs. They have been found in both megabats and microbats across a large geographic area. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. The greatest diversity of bat adenoviruses has been found in Eurasia, though the virus family may be undersampled in bats overall.

Herpesviruses
Diverse herpesviruses have been found in bats in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe, including representatives of the three subfamilies, alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Bat-hosted herpesviruses include the species Pteropodid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1.

Papillomaviruses
Papillomaviruses were first detected in bats in 2006, in the Egyptian fruit bat. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. Five distinct lineages of bat papillomaviruses have been recognized.

Single-stranded DNA viruses

Anelloviruses
No anellovirus is known to cause disease in humans. The first bat anellovirus, a Torque teno virus, was found in a Mexican free-tailed bat. Novel anelloviruses have also been detected in two leaf-nosed bat species: the common vampire bat and Seba's short-tailed bat. The bat anelloviruses and one opossum anellovirus have been included in the proposed genus Sigmatorquevirus.

Circoviruses
Circoviruses, family Circoviridae, are among the most diverse of all viruses. Like anelloviruses, circoviruses are not associated with any disease in humans. About a third of all circoviruses are associated with bats, found in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. A study of horseshoe and vesper bats in China identified circoviruses from the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus.

Parvoviruses
Several kinds of parvoviruses are considered important for human and animal health. Several strains of parvovirus have been identified from bat guano in the US states of Texas and California. Serum analysis of the straw-colored fruit bat and Jamaican fruit bat led to the identification of two new parvoviruses. Bat parvoviruses are in the subfamily Parvovirinae, closely resembling the genera Protoparvovirus, Erythrovirus, and Bocaparvovirus.

Double-stranded RNA viruses

Reoviruses

Zoonotic
Some disease-causing reovirus species are associated with bats. One such virus is Melaka virus, which was linked to illness in a Malaysian man and his two children in 2006. The man said that a bat had been in his home a week before he became ill, and the virus was closely related to other reoviruses linked to bats. Kampar virus was identified a few months later in another Malaysian man. Though he had no known contact with bats, Kampar virus is closely related to Melaka virus. Several other reovirus strains identified in ill humans are known as Miyazaki‐Bali/2007, Sikamat virus, and SI‐MRV01. No reoviruses linked to bats have caused death in humans.

Other

Reoviruses include many viruses that do not cause disease in humans, including several found in bats. One reovirus species associated with bats is Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, sometimes called Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), which is an orthoreovirus; several virus strains of it have been identified in bats. The type member of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus is Nelson Bay virus (NBV), which was first identified in 1970 from the blood of a gray-headed flying fox in New South Wales, Australia. NBV was the first reovirus to be isolated from a bat species. Another strain of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus associated with bats is Pulau virus, which was first identified from the small flying fox of Tioman Island in 2006. Other viruses include Broome orthoreovirus from the little red flying fox of Broome, Western Australia; Xi River virus from Leschenault's rousette in Guangdong, China; and Cangyuan  virus also from Leschenault's rousette. Several mammalian orthoreoviruses are associated with bats, including at least three from Germany and 19 from Italy. These were found in pipistrelles, the brown long-eared bat, and the whiskered bat.

Orbiviruses have been isolated from bats, including Ife virus from the straw-colored fruit bat, Japanaut  virus from the common blossom bat, and Fomédé  virus from Nycteris species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Astroviruses
Astroviruses have been found in several genera of bat in the Old World, including Miniopterus, Myotis, Hipposideros, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Scotophilus, and Taphozous, though none in Africa. Bats have very high prevalence rates of astroviruses; studies in Hong Kong and mainland China found prevalence rates approaching 50% from anal swabs. No astroviruses identified in bats are associated with disease in humans.

Caliciviruses
Bat caliciviruses were first identified in Hong Kong in the Pomona roundleaf bat, and were later identified from tricolored bats in the US state of Maryland. Bat caliciviruses are similar to the genera Sapovirus and Valovirus, with noroviruses also detected from two microbat species in China.

Coronaviruses

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV

Several zoonotic coronaviruses are associated with bats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is another zoonotic coronavirus likely originating in bats. SARS-CoV causes the disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The first documented case of SARS was in November 2002 in Foshan, China. It became an epidemic, affecting 28 countries around the world with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was identified as bats, with the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat considered a particularly strong candidate after a coronavirus was recovered from a colony that had 95% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. There is uncertainty on whether or not animals like palm civets and raccoon dogs were intermediate hosts that facilitated the spread of the virus from bats to humans, or if humans acquired the virus directly from bats.

The first human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was in June 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of November 2019, 2,494 cases of MERS have been reported in twenty-seven countries, resulting in 858 fatalities. It is believed that MERS-CoV originated in bats, though camels are likely the intermediate host through which humans became infected. Human-to-human transmission is possible, though does not easily occur.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in humans started in Wuhan, China in 2019. Genetic analyses of SARS-COV-2 showed that it was highly similar to viruses found in horseshoe bats, with 96% similarity to a virus isolated from the intermediate horseshoe bat. Due to similarity with known bat coronaviruses, data "clearly indicates" that the natural reservoirs of SARS-COV-2 are bats. It is yet unclear how the virus was transmitted to humans, though an intermediate host may have been involved. Phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the strain that caused a human pandemic diverged from the strain found in bats decades ago, likely between 1950 and 1980.

Other
Bats harbor a great diversity of coronaviruses, with sampling by the EcoHealth Alliance in China alone identifying about 400 new strains of coronavirus. A study of coronavirus diversity harbored by bats in eastern Thailand revealed forty-seven coronaviruses.

Flaviviruses

Most flaviviruses are transmitted via arthropods, but bats may play a role in the ecology of some species. Several strains of Dengue virus have been found in bats in the Americas, and West Nile virus has been identified in fruit bats in South India. Serological studies indicate that West Nile virus may also be present in bats in North America and the Yucatán Peninsula. Saint Louis encephalitis virus has been detected in bats in the US states of Texas and Ohio, as well as the Yucatán Peninsula. Japanese encephalitis virus or its associated antibodies have been found in several bat species throughout Asia. Other flaviviruses detected in bats include Sepik virus, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Yokose virus, Dakar bat virus, Bukalasa bat virus,  Carey Island virus, Phnom Penh bat virus,  Rio Bravo bat virus,  Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus, and Tamana bat virus.

Picornaviruses
Several genera of picornaviruses have been found in bats, including Kobuvirus, Sapelovirus, Cardiovirus, and Senecavirus. Picornaviruses have been identified from a diverse array of bat species around the world.

Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Arenaviruses
Arenaviruses are mainly associated with rodents, though some can cause illness in humans. The first arenavirus identified in bats was Tacaribe mammarenavirus, which was isolated from Jamaican fruit bats and the great fruit-eating bat. Antibody response associated with Tacaribe virus has also been found in the common vampire bat, the little yellow-shouldered bat, and Heller's broad-nosed bat. It is unclear if bats are the natural reservoir of Tacaribe virus. There has been one known human infection by Tacaribe virus, though it was accidentally acquired in a laboratory setting.

Hantaviruses
Hantaviruses, family Hantaviridae, naturally occur in vertebrates. All bat-associated hantaviruses are in the subfamily Mammantavirinae. Of the four genera within the subfamily, Loanvirus and Mobatvirus are the genera that have been documented in various bats. Almost all bat hantaviruses have been identified from microbats. Mouyassue virus has been identified from the banana pipistrelle in Ivory Coast and the Cape serotine in Ethiopia; Magboi virus from the hairy slit-faced bat in Sierra Leone; Xuan Son virus from the Pomona roundleaf bat in Vietnam; Huangpi virus from the Japanese house bat in China; Longquan loanvirus from several horseshoe bats in China; Makokou virus from Noack's roundleaf bat in Gabon; Đakrông virus from Stoliczka's trident bat in Vietnam; Brno loanvirus from the common noctule in the Czech Republic; and Laibin mobatvirus from the black-bearded tomb bat in China. As of 2019, only Quezon mobatvirus has been identified from a megabat, as it was identified from a Geoffroy's rousette in the Philippines. Bat hantaviruses are not associated with illness in humans.

Filoviruses

Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus

Filoviridae is a family of virus containing two genera associated with bats: Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which contain the species that cause Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease, respectively. Though relatively few disease outbreaks are caused by filoviruses, they are of high concern due to their extreme virulence, or capacity to cause harm to their hosts. Filovirus outbreaks typically have high mortality rates in humans. Though the first filovirus was identified in 1967, it took more than twenty years to identify any natural reservoirs.

Ebola virus disease is a relatively rare but life-threatening illness in humans, with an average mortality rate of 50% (though individual outbreaks may be as high as 90% mortality). The first outbreaks were in 1976 in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The natural reservoirs of ebolaviruses are unknown. However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs. Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat. Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates. Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks.

Marburg virus disease (MVD) was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia. MVD is highly virulent, with an average human mortality rate of 50%, but as high as 88% for individual outbreaks. MVD is caused by Marburg virus and the closely related Ravn virus, which was formerly considered synonymous with Marburg virus. Marburg virus was first detected in the Egyptian fruit bat in 2007, which is now recognized as the natural reservoir of the virus. Marburg virus has been detected in Egyptian fruit bats in Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda. Spillover from Egyptian fruit bats occurs when humans spend prolonged time in mines or caves inhabited by the bats, though the exact mechanism of transmission is unclear. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood or semen, or indirectly through contact with bedding or clothing exposed to these fluids.

Other
Lloviu virus, a kind of filovirus in the genus Cuevavirus, has been identified from the common bent-wing bat in Spain. Another filovirus, Bombali ebolavirus, has been isolated from free-tailed bats, including the little free-tailed bat and the Angolan free-tailed bat. Neither Lloviu virus nor Bombali ebolavirus is associated with illness in humans. Genomic RNA associated with Mengla dianlovirus, though not the virus itself, has been identified from Rousettus bats in China.

Rhabdoviruses

Rabies-causing viruses

Lyssaviruses (from the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae) include the rabies virus, Australian bat lyssavirus, and other related viruses, many of which are also harbored by bats. Unlike most other viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, which are transmitted by arthropods, lyssaviruses are transmitted by mammals, most frequently through biting. All mammals are susceptible to lyssaviruses, though bats and carnivores are the most common natural reservoirs. The vast majority of human rabies cases are a result of the rabies virus, with only twelve other human cases attributed to other lyssaviruses as of 2015. These rarer lyssaviruses associated with bats include Duvenhage lyssavirus (three human cases as of 2015); European bat 1 lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015); European bat 2 lyssavirus (two human cases as of 2015); and Irkut lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015). Microbats are suspected as the reservoirs of these four uncommon lyssaviruses.

After transmission has occurred, the average human is asymptomatic for two months, though the incubation period can be as short as a week or as long as several years.
Italian scientist Antonio Carini was the first to hypothesize that rabies virus could be transmitted by bats, which he did in 1911. This same conclusion was reached by Hélder Queiroz in 1934 and Joseph Lennox Pawan in 1936. Vampire bats were the first to be documented with rabies; in 1953, an insectivorous bat in Florida was discovered with rabies, making it the first documented occurrence in an insectivorous species outside the vampire bats' ranges. Bats have an overall low prevalence of rabies virus, with a majority of surveys of apparently healthy individuals showing rabies incidence of 0.0–0.5%. Sick bats are more likely to be submitted for rabies testing than apparently healthy bats, known as sampling bias, with most studies reporting rabies incidence of 5–20% in sick or dead bats. Rabies virus exposure can be fatal in bats, though it is likely that the majority of individuals do not develop the disease after exposure. In non-bat mammals, exposure to the rabies virus almost always leads to death.

Globally, dogs are by far the most common source of human rabies deaths. Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia. Many feeding guilds of bats may transmit rabies to humans, including insectivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, omnivorous, sanguivorous, and carnivorous species. The common vampire bat is a source of human rabies in Central and South America, though the frequency at which humans are bitten is poorly understood. Between 1993 and 2002, the majority of human rabies cases associated with bats in the Americas were the result of non-vampire bats. In North America, about half of human rabies instances are cryptic, meaning that the patient has no known bite history. While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, "investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission". It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite. Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin.

Other
Many bat lyssaviruses are not associated with infection in humans. These include Lagos bat lyssavirus, Shimoni bat lyssavirus, Khujand lyssavirus, Aravan lyssavirus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, West Caucasian bat lyssavirus, and Lleida bat lyssavirus. Lagos bat lyssavirus, also known as Lagos bat virus (LBV), has been isolated from a megabat in sub-Saharan Africa. This lyssavirus has four distinct lineages, all of which are found in the straw-colored fruit bat.

Rhabdoviruses from other genera have been identified in bats. This includes several from the genus Ledantevirus: Kern Canyon virus, which was found in the Yuma myotis in California (US); Kolente virus from the Jones's roundleaf bat in Guinea; Mount Elgon bat virus from the eloquent horseshoe bat in Kenya; Oita virus from the little Japanese horseshoe bat; and Fikirini virus from the striped leaf-nosed bat in Kenya.

Orthomyxoviruses

Orthomyxoviruses include influenza viruses. While birds are the primary reservoir for the genus Alphainfluenzavirus, a few bat species in Central and South America have also tested positive for the viruses. These species include the little yellow-shouldered bat and the flat-faced fruit-eating bat. Bat populations tested in Guatemala and Peru had high seropositivity rates, which suggests that influenza A infections are common among bats in the New World.

Paramyxoviruses

Hendra, Nipah, and Menangle viruses

Paramyxoviridae is a family that includes several zoonotic viruses naturally found in bats. Two are in the genus Henipavirus—Hendra virus and Nipah virus. Hendra virus was first identified in 1994 in Hendra, Australia. Four different species of flying fox have tested positive for Hendra virus: the gray-headed flying fox, little red flying fox, spectacled flying fox, and black flying fox. Horses are the intermediate host between flying foxes and humans. Between 1994 and 2014, there were fifty-five outbreaks of Hendra virus in Australia, resulting in the death or euthanization of eighty-eight horses. Seven humans are known to have been infected by Hendra virus, with four fatalities. Six of the seven infected humans were directly exposed to the blood or other fluids of sick or dead horses (three were veterinarians), while the seventh case was a veterinary nurse who had recently irrigated the nasal cavity of a horse not yet exhibiting symptoms. It is unclear how horses become infected with Hendra virus, though it is believed to occur following direct exposure to flying fox fluids. There is also evidence of horse-to-horse transmission. In late 2012, a vaccine was released to prevent infection in horses. Vaccine uptake has been low, with an estimated 11–17% of Australian horses vaccinated by 2017.

The first human outbreak of Nipah virus was in 1998 in Malaysia. It was determined that flying foxes were also the reservoir of the virus, with domestic pigs as the intermediate host between bats and humans. Outbreaks have also occurred in Bangladesh, India, Singapore, and the Philippines. In Bangladesh, the primary mode of transmission of Nipah virus to humans is through the consumption of date palm sap. Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and guano, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots. It has been speculated that the virus may also be transmitted to humans by eating fruit partially consumed by flying foxes, or by coming into contact with their urine, though no definitive evidence supports this.

An additional zoonotic paramyxovirus that bats harbor is Menangle virus, which was first identified at a hog farm in New South Wales, Australia. Flying foxes were once again identified as the natural reservoirs of the virus, with the black, spectacled, and gray-headed seropositive for the virus. Two employees of the hog farm became sick with flu-like illnesses, later shown to be a result of the virus. Sosuga pararubulavirus is known to have infected one person—an American wildlife biologist who had conducted bat and rodent research in Uganda. The Egyptian fruit bat later tested positive for the virus, indicating that it is potentially a natural reservoir.

Other
Bats host several paramyxoviruses that are not known to affect humans. Bats are the reservoir of Cedar virus, a paramyxovirus first discovered in flying foxes South East Queensland. The zoonotic potential of Cedar virus is unknown. In Brazil in 1979, Mapuera orthorubulavirus was isolated from the saliva of the little yellow-shouldered bat. Mapuera virus has never been associated with disease in other animals or humans, but experimental exposure of mice to the virus resulted in fatality. Tioman pararubulavirus has been isolated from the urine of the small flying fox, which causes fever in some domestic pigs after exposure, but no other symptoms. Tukoko virus has been detected from Leschenault's rousette in China. Bats have been suggested as the host of Porcine orthorubulavirus, though definitive evidence has not been collected.

Togaviruses
Togaviruses include alphaviruses, which have been detected in bats. Alphaviruses cause encephalitis in humans. Alphaviruses that have been detected in bats include Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus. Sindbis virus has been detected from horseshoe bats and roundleaf bats. Chikungunya virus has been isolated from Leschenault's rousette, the Egyptian fruit bat, Sundevall's roundleaf bat, the little free-tailed bat, and Scotophilus species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate

Retroviruses
Bats can be infected with retroviruses, including the gammaretrovirus found in horseshoe bats, Leschenault's rousette, and the greater false vampire bat. Several bat retroviruses have been identified that are similar to the Reticuloendotheliosis virus found in birds. These retroviruses were found in mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. The discovery of varied and distinct gammaretroviruses in bat genomes indicates that bats likely played important roles in their diversification. Bats also host an extensive number of betaretroviruses, including within mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. Bat betaretroviruses span the entire breadth of betaretrovirus diversity, similar to those of rodents, which may indicate that bats and rodents are primary reservoirs of the viruses. Betaretroviruses have infected bats for a majority of bat evolutionary history, since at least 36 million years ago.

Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate

Hepadnaviruses
Hepadnaviruses are also known to affect bats, with the tent-making bat, Noack's roundleaf bat, and the halcyon horseshoe bat known to harbor several. The hepadnovirus found in the tent-making bat, which is a New World species, was the closest relative of human hepadnoviruses. Though relatively few hepadnaviruses have been identified in bats, it is highly likely that additional strains will be discovered through further research. As of 2016, they had been found in four bat families: Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera and Molossidae and Vespertilionidae from Yangochiroptera. The high diversity of bat hosts suggests that bats share a long evolutionary history with hepadnaviruses, indicating bats may have had an important role in hepadnavirus evolution.

 The bat virome is the group of viruses associated with bats. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae.

Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic, or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano, or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host. There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated.

Despite the abundance of viruses associated with bats, they rarely become ill from viral infections, and rabies is the only viral illness known to kill bats. Much research has been conducted on bat virology, particularly bat immune response. Bats' immune systems differ from other mammals in their lack of several inflammasomes, which activate the body's inflammatory response, as well as a dampened stimulator of interferon genes (STING) response, which helps control host response to pathogens. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. A 2015 review found that bats do not harbor more zoonotic viruses than primates or rodents, though the three groups harbored more than other mammal orders. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals.

Viral diversity

Viruses have been found in bat populations around the world. Bats harbor all groups of viruses in the Baltimore classification, representing at least 28 families of viruses. Most of the viruses harbored by bats are RNA viruses, though they are also known to have DNA viruses. Bats are more tolerant of viruses than terrestrial mammals. A single bat can host several different kinds of viruses without becoming ill. Bats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity. Their behavior and life history also make them "exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement.

Though bats harbor diverse viruses, they are rarely lethal to the bat host. Only the rabies virus and a few other lyssaviruses have been confirmed to kill bats. Various factors have been implicated in bats' ability to survive viral infections. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Flight produces a fever-like response, resulting in elevated temperature (up to ) and metabolic rate. Additionally, this fever-like response may help them cope with actual fevers upon getting a viral infection. Some research indicates that bats' immune systems have allowed them to cope with a variety of viruses. A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened STING response compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. STING is a signaling molecule that helps coordinate various host defense genes against pathogens. The authors of the study concluded that "the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses."

Additionally, bats lack several inflammasomes found in other mammals; other inflammasomes are present with a greatly reduced response. While inflammation is an immune response to viruses, excessive inflammation is damaging to the body, and viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are known to kill humans by inducing excessive inflammation. Bats' immune systems may have evolved to be more tolerant of stressors such as viral infections compared to other mammals.

Transmission to humans

The vast majority of bat viruses have no zoonotic potential, meaning they cannot be transmitted to humans. The zoonotic viruses have four possible routes of transmission to humans: contact with bat body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, feces); intermediate hosts; environmental exposure; and blood-feeding arthropods. Lyssaviruses like the rabies virus are transmitted from bats to humans via biting. Transmission of most other viruses does not appear to take place via biting, however. Contact with bat fluids such as guano, urine, and saliva is an important source of spillover from bats to humans. Other mammals may play a role in transmitting bat viruses to people, with pig farms a source of bat-borne viruses in Malaysia and Australia. Other possible transmission routes of bat-borne viruses are more speculative. It is possible but unconfirmed that hunting, butchering, and consuming bat meat can result in viral spillover. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. There is little evidence of environmental transmission of viruses from bats to humans, meaning that bat-borne virus do not persist in the environment for long. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the subject.

Bats compared to other viral reservoirs
Bats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal orders, an example of research bias. A 2015 review found that from 1999 to 2013, there were 300–1200 papers published about bat viruses annually, compared to 12–45 publications for marsupial viruses and only 1–9 studies for sloth viruses. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). A 2020 review of mammals and birds found that the identity of the taxonomic groups did not have any impact on the probability of harboring zoonotic viruses. Instead, more diverse groups had greater viral diversity. Bat life history traits and immunity, while likely influential in determining bat viral communities, were not associated with a greater probability of viral spillover into humans.

Sampling
Bats are sampled for viruses in a variety of ways. They can be tested for seropositivity for a given virus using a method like ELISA, which determines whether or not they have the corresponding antibodies for the virus. They can also be surveyed using molecular detection techniques like PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which can be used to replicate and amplify viral sequences. Histopathology, which is the microscopic examination of tissue, can also be used. Viruses have been isolated from bat blood, saliva, feces, tissue, and urine. Some sampling is non-invasive and does not require killing the bat for sampling, whereas other sampling requires sacrificing the animal first. A 2016 review found no significant difference in total number of viruses found and new viruses discovered between lethal and non-lethal studies. Several species of threatened bat have been killed for viral sampling, including the Comoro rousette, Hildegarde's tomb bat, Natal free-tailed bat, and the long-fingered bat.

Double-stranded DNA viruses

Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses have been detected in bat guano, urine, and oral and rectal swabs. They have been found in both megabats and microbats across a large geographic area. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. The greatest diversity of bat adenoviruses has been found in Eurasia, though the virus family may be undersampled in bats overall.

Herpesviruses
Diverse herpesviruses have been found in bats in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe, including representatives of the three subfamilies, alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Bat-hosted herpesviruses include the species Pteropodid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1.

Papillomaviruses
Papillomaviruses were first detected in bats in 2006, in the Egyptian fruit bat. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. Five distinct lineages of bat papillomaviruses have been recognized.

Single-stranded DNA viruses

Anelloviruses
No anellovirus is known to cause disease in humans. The first bat anellovirus, a Torque teno virus, was found in a Mexican free-tailed bat. Novel anelloviruses have also been detected in two leaf-nosed bat species: the common vampire bat and Seba's short-tailed bat. The bat anelloviruses and one opossum anellovirus have been included in the proposed genus Sigmatorquevirus.

Circoviruses
Circoviruses, family Circoviridae, are among the most diverse of all viruses. Like anelloviruses, circoviruses are not associated with any disease in humans. About a third of all circoviruses are associated with bats, found in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. A study of horseshoe and vesper bats in China identified circoviruses from the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus.

Parvoviruses
Several kinds of parvoviruses are considered important for human and animal health. Several strains of parvovirus have been identified from bat guano in the US states of Texas and California. Serum analysis of the straw-colored fruit bat and Jamaican fruit bat led to the identification of two new parvoviruses. Bat parvoviruses are in the subfamily Parvovirinae, closely resembling the genera Protoparvovirus, Erythrovirus, and Bocaparvovirus.

Double-stranded RNA viruses

Reoviruses

Zoonotic
Some disease-causing reovirus species are associated with bats. One such virus is Melaka virus, which was linked to illness in a Malaysian man and his two children in 2006. The man said that a bat had been in his home a week before he became ill, and the virus was closely related to other reoviruses linked to bats. Kampar virus was identified a few months later in another Malaysian man. Though he had no known contact with bats, Kampar virus is closely related to Melaka virus. Several other reovirus strains identified in ill humans are known as Miyazaki‐Bali/2007, Sikamat virus, and SI‐MRV01. No reoviruses linked to bats have caused death in humans.

Other

Reoviruses include many viruses that do not cause disease in humans, including several found in bats. One reovirus species associated with bats is Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, sometimes called Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), which is an orthoreovirus; several virus strains of it have been identified in bats. The type member of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus is Nelson Bay virus (NBV), which was first identified in 1970 from the blood of a gray-headed flying fox in New South Wales, Australia. NBV was the first reovirus to be isolated from a bat species. Another strain of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus associated with bats is Pulau virus, which was first identified from the small flying fox of Tioman Island in 2006. Other viruses include Broome orthoreovirus from the little red flying fox of Broome, Western Australia; Xi River virus from Leschenault's rousette in Guangdong, China; and Cangyuan  virus also from Leschenault's rousette. Several mammalian orthoreoviruses are associated with bats, including at least three from Germany and 19 from Italy. These were found in pipistrelles, the brown long-eared bat, and the whiskered bat.

Orbiviruses have been isolated from bats, including Ife virus from the straw-colored fruit bat, Japanaut  virus from the common blossom bat, and Fomédé  virus from Nycteris species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Astroviruses
Astroviruses have been found in several genera of bat in the Old World, including Miniopterus, Myotis, Hipposideros, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Scotophilus, and Taphozous, though none in Africa. Bats have very high prevalence rates of astroviruses; studies in Hong Kong and mainland China found prevalence rates approaching 50% from anal swabs. No astroviruses identified in bats are associated with disease in humans.

Caliciviruses
Bat caliciviruses were first identified in Hong Kong in the Pomona roundleaf bat, and were later identified from tricolored bats in the US state of Maryland. Bat caliciviruses are similar to the genera Sapovirus and Valovirus, with noroviruses also detected from two microbat species in China.

Coronaviruses

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV

Several zoonotic coronaviruses are associated with bats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is another zoonotic coronavirus likely originating in bats. SARS-CoV causes the disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The first documented case of SARS was in November 2002 in Foshan, China. It became an epidemic, affecting 28 countries around the world with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was identified as bats, with the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat considered a particularly strong candidate after a coronavirus was recovered from a colony that had 95% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. There is uncertainty on whether or not animals like palm civets and raccoon dogs were intermediate hosts that facilitated the spread of the virus from bats to humans, or if humans acquired the virus directly from bats.

The first human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was in June 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of November 2019, 2,494 cases of MERS have been reported in twenty-seven countries, resulting in 858 fatalities. It is believed that MERS-CoV originated in bats, though camels are likely the intermediate host through which humans became infected. Human-to-human transmission is possible, though does not easily occur.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in humans started in Wuhan, China in 2019. Genetic analyses of SARS-COV-2 showed that it was highly similar to viruses found in horseshoe bats, with 96% similarity to a virus isolated from the intermediate horseshoe bat. Due to similarity with known bat coronaviruses, data "clearly indicates" that the natural reservoirs of SARS-COV-2 are bats. It is yet unclear how the virus was transmitted to humans, though an intermediate host may have been involved. Phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the strain that caused a human pandemic diverged from the strain found in bats decades ago, likely between 1950 and 1980.

Other
Bats harbor a great diversity of coronaviruses, with sampling by the EcoHealth Alliance in China alone identifying about 400 new strains of coronavirus. A study of coronavirus diversity harbored by bats in eastern Thailand revealed forty-seven coronaviruses.

Flaviviruses

Most flaviviruses are transmitted via arthropods, but bats may play a role in the ecology of some species. Several strains of Dengue virus have been found in bats in the Americas, and West Nile virus has been identified in fruit bats in South India. Serological studies indicate that West Nile virus may also be present in bats in North America and the Yucatán Peninsula. Saint Louis encephalitis virus has been detected in bats in the US states of Texas and Ohio, as well as the Yucatán Peninsula. Japanese encephalitis virus or its associated antibodies have been found in several bat species throughout Asia. Other flaviviruses detected in bats include Sepik virus, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Yokose virus, Dakar bat virus, Bukalasa bat virus,  Carey Island virus, Phnom Penh bat virus,  Rio Bravo bat virus,  Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus, and Tamana bat virus.

Picornaviruses
Several genera of picornaviruses have been found in bats, including Kobuvirus, Sapelovirus, Cardiovirus, and Senecavirus. Picornaviruses have been identified from a diverse array of bat species around the world.

Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Arenaviruses
Arenaviruses are mainly associated with rodents, though some can cause illness in humans. The first arenavirus identified in bats was Tacaribe mammarenavirus, which was isolated from Jamaican fruit bats and the great fruit-eating bat. Antibody response associated with Tacaribe virus has also been found in the common vampire bat, the little yellow-shouldered bat, and Heller's broad-nosed bat. It is unclear if bats are the natural reservoir of Tacaribe virus. There has been one known human infection by Tacaribe virus, though it was accidentally acquired in a laboratory setting.

Hantaviruses
Hantaviruses, family Hantaviridae, naturally occur in vertebrates. All bat-associated hantaviruses are in the subfamily Mammantavirinae. Of the four genera within the subfamily, Loanvirus and Mobatvirus are the genera that have been documented in various bats. Almost all bat hantaviruses have been identified from microbats. Mouyassue virus has been identified from the banana pipistrelle in Ivory Coast and the Cape serotine in Ethiopia; Magboi virus from the hairy slit-faced bat in Sierra Leone; Xuan Son virus from the Pomona roundleaf bat in Vietnam; Huangpi virus from the Japanese house bat in China; Longquan loanvirus from several horseshoe bats in China; Makokou virus from Noack's roundleaf bat in Gabon; Đakrông virus from Stoliczka's trident bat in Vietnam; Brno loanvirus from the common noctule in the Czech Republic; and Laibin mobatvirus from the black-bearded tomb bat in China. As of 2019, only Quezon mobatvirus has been identified from a megabat, as it was identified from a Geoffroy's rousette in the Philippines. Bat hantaviruses are not associated with illness in humans.

Filoviruses

Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus

Filoviridae is a family of virus containing two genera associated with bats: Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which contain the species that cause Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease, respectively. Though relatively few disease outbreaks are caused by filoviruses, they are of high concern due to their extreme virulence, or capacity to cause harm to their hosts. Filovirus outbreaks typically have high mortality rates in humans. Though the first filovirus was identified in 1967, it took more than twenty years to identify any natural reservoirs.

Ebola virus disease is a relatively rare but life-threatening illness in humans, with an average mortality rate of 50% (though individual outbreaks may be as high as 90% mortality). The first outbreaks were in 1976 in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The natural reservoirs of ebolaviruses are unknown. However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs. Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat. Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates. Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks.

Marburg virus disease (MVD) was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia. MVD is highly virulent, with an average human mortality rate of 50%, but as high as 88% for individual outbreaks. MVD is caused by Marburg virus and the closely related Ravn virus, which was formerly considered synonymous with Marburg virus. Marburg virus was first detected in the Egyptian fruit bat in 2007, which is now recognized as the natural reservoir of the virus. Marburg virus has been detected in Egyptian fruit bats in Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda. Spillover from Egyptian fruit bats occurs when humans spend prolonged time in mines or caves inhabited by the bats, though the exact mechanism of transmission is unclear. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood or semen, or indirectly through contact with bedding or clothing exposed to these fluids.

Other
Lloviu virus, a kind of filovirus in the genus Cuevavirus, has been identified from the common bent-wing bat in Spain. Another filovirus, Bombali ebolavirus, has been isolated from free-tailed bats, including the little free-tailed bat and the Angolan free-tailed bat. Neither Lloviu virus nor Bombali ebolavirus is associated with illness in humans. Genomic RNA associated with Mengla dianlovirus, though not the virus itself, has been identified from Rousettus bats in China.

Rhabdoviruses

Rabies-causing viruses

Lyssaviruses (from the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae) include the rabies virus, Australian bat lyssavirus, and other related viruses, many of which are also harbored by bats. Unlike most other viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, which are transmitted by arthropods, lyssaviruses are transmitted by mammals, most frequently through biting. All mammals are susceptible to lyssaviruses, though bats and carnivores are the most common natural reservoirs. The vast majority of human rabies cases are a result of the rabies virus, with only twelve other human cases attributed to other lyssaviruses as of 2015. These rarer lyssaviruses associated with bats include Duvenhage lyssavirus (three human cases as of 2015); European bat 1 lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015); European bat 2 lyssavirus (two human cases as of 2015); and Irkut lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015). Microbats are suspected as the reservoirs of these four uncommon lyssaviruses.

After transmission has occurred, the average human is asymptomatic for two months, though the incubation period can be as short as a week or as long as several years.
Italian scientist Antonio Carini was the first to hypothesize that rabies virus could be transmitted by bats, which he did in 1911. This same conclusion was reached by Hélder Queiroz in 1934 and Joseph Lennox Pawan in 1936. Vampire bats were the first to be documented with rabies; in 1953, an insectivorous bat in Florida was discovered with rabies, making it the first documented occurrence in an insectivorous species outside the vampire bats' ranges. Bats have an overall low prevalence of rabies virus, with a majority of surveys of apparently healthy individuals showing rabies incidence of 0.0–0.5%. Sick bats are more likely to be submitted for rabies testing than apparently healthy bats, known as sampling bias, with most studies reporting rabies incidence of 5–20% in sick or dead bats. Rabies virus exposure can be fatal in bats, though it is likely that the majority of individuals do not develop the disease after exposure. In non-bat mammals, exposure to the rabies virus almost always leads to death.

Globally, dogs are by far the most common source of human rabies deaths. Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia. Many feeding guilds of bats may transmit rabies to humans, including insectivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, omnivorous, sanguivorous, and carnivorous species. The common vampire bat is a source of human rabies in Central and South America, though the frequency at which humans are bitten is poorly understood. Between 1993 and 2002, the majority of human rabies cases associated with bats in the Americas were the result of non-vampire bats. In North America, about half of human rabies instances are cryptic, meaning that the patient has no known bite history. While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, "investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission". It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite. Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin.

Other
Many bat lyssaviruses are not associated with infection in humans. These include Lagos bat lyssavirus, Shimoni bat lyssavirus, Khujand lyssavirus, Aravan lyssavirus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, West Caucasian bat lyssavirus, and Lleida bat lyssavirus. Lagos bat lyssavirus, also known as Lagos bat virus (LBV), has been isolated from a megabat in sub-Saharan Africa. This lyssavirus has four distinct lineages, all of which are found in the straw-colored fruit bat.

Rhabdoviruses from other genera have been identified in bats. This includes several from the genus Ledantevirus: Kern Canyon virus, which was found in the Yuma myotis in California (US); Kolente virus from the Jones's roundleaf bat in Guinea; Mount Elgon bat virus from the eloquent horseshoe bat in Kenya; Oita virus from the little Japanese horseshoe bat; and Fikirini virus from the striped leaf-nosed bat in Kenya.

Orthomyxoviruses

Orthomyxoviruses include influenza viruses. While birds are the primary reservoir for the genus Alphainfluenzavirus, a few bat species in Central and South America have also tested positive for the viruses. These species include the little yellow-shouldered bat and the flat-faced fruit-eating bat. Bat populations tested in Guatemala and Peru had high seropositivity rates, which suggests that influenza A infections are common among bats in the New World.

Paramyxoviruses

Hendra, Nipah, and Menangle viruses

Paramyxoviridae is a family that includes several zoonotic viruses naturally found in bats. Two are in the genus Henipavirus—Hendra virus and Nipah virus. Hendra virus was first identified in 1994 in Hendra, Australia. Four different species of flying fox have tested positive for Hendra virus: the gray-headed flying fox, little red flying fox, spectacled flying fox, and black flying fox. Horses are the intermediate host between flying foxes and humans. Between 1994 and 2014, there were fifty-five outbreaks of Hendra virus in Australia, resulting in the death or euthanization of eighty-eight horses. Seven humans are known to have been infected by Hendra virus, with four fatalities. Six of the seven infected humans were directly exposed to the blood or other fluids of sick or dead horses (three were veterinarians), while the seventh case was a veterinary nurse who had recently irrigated the nasal cavity of a horse not yet exhibiting symptoms. It is unclear how horses become infected with Hendra virus, though it is believed to occur following direct exposure to flying fox fluids. There is also evidence of horse-to-horse transmission. In late 2012, a vaccine was released to prevent infection in horses. Vaccine uptake has been low, with an estimated 11–17% of Australian horses vaccinated by 2017.

The first human outbreak of Nipah virus was in 1998 in Malaysia. It was determined that flying foxes were also the reservoir of the virus, with domestic pigs as the intermediate host between bats and humans. Outbreaks have also occurred in Bangladesh, India, Singapore, and the Philippines. In Bangladesh, the primary mode of transmission of Nipah virus to humans is through the consumption of date palm sap. Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and guano, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots. It has been speculated that the virus may also be transmitted to humans by eating fruit partially consumed by flying foxes, or by coming into contact with their urine, though no definitive evidence supports this.

An additional zoonotic paramyxovirus that bats harbor is Menangle virus, which was first identified at a hog farm in New South Wales, Australia. Flying foxes were once again identified as the natural reservoirs of the virus, with the black, spectacled, and gray-headed seropositive for the virus. Two employees of the hog farm became sick with flu-like illnesses, later shown to be a result of the virus. Sosuga pararubulavirus is known to have infected one person—an American wildlife biologist who had conducted bat and rodent research in Uganda. The Egyptian fruit bat later tested positive for the virus, indicating that it is potentially a natural reservoir.

Other
Bats host several paramyxoviruses that are not known to affect humans. Bats are the reservoir of Cedar virus, a paramyxovirus first discovered in flying foxes South East Queensland. The zoonotic potential of Cedar virus is unknown. In Brazil in 1979, Mapuera orthorubulavirus was isolated from the saliva of the little yellow-shouldered bat. Mapuera virus has never been associated with disease in other animals or humans, but experimental exposure of mice to the virus resulted in fatality. Tioman pararubulavirus has been isolated from the urine of the small flying fox, which causes fever in some domestic pigs after exposure, but no other symptoms. Tukoko virus has been detected from Leschenault's rousette in China. Bats have been suggested as the host of Porcine orthorubulavirus, though definitive evidence has not been collected.

Togaviruses
Togaviruses include alphaviruses, which have been detected in bats. Alphaviruses cause encephalitis in humans. Alphaviruses that have been detected in bats include Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus. Sindbis virus has been detected from horseshoe bats and roundleaf bats. Chikungunya virus has been isolated from Leschenault's rousette, the Egyptian fruit bat, Sundevall's roundleaf bat, the little free-tailed bat, and Scotophilus species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate

Retroviruses
Bats can be infected with retroviruses, including the gammaretrovirus found in horseshoe bats, Leschenault's rousette, and the greater false vampire bat. Several bat retroviruses have been identified that are similar to the Reticuloendotheliosis virus found in birds. These retroviruses were found in mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. The discovery of varied and distinct gammaretroviruses in bat genomes indicates that bats likely played important roles in their diversification. Bats also host an extensive number of betaretroviruses, including within mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. Bat betaretroviruses span the entire breadth of betaretrovirus diversity, similar to those of rodents, which may indicate that bats and rodents are primary reservoirs of the viruses. Betaretroviruses have infected bats for a majority of bat evolutionary history, since at least 36 million years ago.

Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate

Hepadnaviruses
Hepadnaviruses are also known to affect bats, with the tent-making bat, Noack's roundleaf bat, and the halcyon horseshoe bat known to harbor several. The hepadnovirus found in the tent-making bat, which is a New World species, was the closest relative of human hepadnoviruses. Though relatively few hepadnaviruses have been identified in bats, it is highly likely that additional strains will be discovered through further research. As of 2016, they had been found in four bat families: Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera and Molossidae and Vespertilionidae from Yangochiroptera. The high diversity of bat hosts suggests that bats share a long evolutionary history with hepadnaviruses, indicating bats may have had an important role in hepadnavirus evolution.

 1 -4.89905  During the breeding season, late October to early November, female bats congregate in groups and give birth to a single young. The generation length is estimated at four years. According to a study conducted on range of ghost bats in Australia, “female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% for females greater than 2 years old”. Maternity colonies are founded in large and open caves and occupied until the young are reared. The teats are evident in females during the maternity season. The possession of anterior teats allows the new born to cling to the mother until the milk teeth are shed. The young are born in the austral spring, are able to fly after seven weeks, and become fully weaned at sixteen weeks. As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. The males play no part in the rearing of young. The juvenile hunts with the mother until reaching an independent stage of its maturity.
 2 -5.27376  hibernation and spring migration. Adult mortality is especially high during spring migration, as bats that do not have sufficient fat reserves have difficulties surviving the stress and energy-intensive migration period. After copulation, females store sperm in their uteri, ovulating only after they have emerged from hibernation. Gestation in gray bats lasts 60 to 70 days, with birth occurring in late May and early June. Gray bat females give birth to one offspring per clutch (bout of reproduction), thus giving birth to one offspring per year. Therefore, gray bats demonstrate an iteroparous life-history strategy. The young clings to the mother for about a week, after which they remain in the maternity colony until they are able to fly. Most young take flight by four weeks of age (late June to mid-July).
 3 -6.02619  Bats are the only mammal capable of true flight. Bats use flight for capturing prey, breeding, avoiding predators, and long-distance migration. Bat wing morphology is often highly specialized to the needs of the species.
 4 -6.97687  Male lesser mouse-tailed bats mature at sixteen to seventeen months of age. Female bats become sexually mature at nine months of age and are monestrous i.e. they have one oestrus cycle per year. The mating season is generally in the months of February to April. Gestation lasts from 95 to 100 days and only one offspring is produced in a brood, usually in June–July. The young bats take flight at the age of five to six weeks.
 5 -8.36859 The bat virome is the group of viruses associated with bats. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. The greatest share of bat-associated viruses identified as of 2020 are of type IV, in the family Coronaviridae.

Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic, or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. While research clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, it is unknown how it was transmitted to humans, or if an intermediate host was involved. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. While transmission of rabies from bats to humans usually occurs via biting, most other zoonotic bat viruses are transmitted by direct contact with infected bat fluids like urine, guano, or saliva, or through contact with an infected, non-bat intermediate host. There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated.

Despite the abundance of viruses associated with bats, they rarely become ill from viral infections, and rabies is the only viral illness known to kill bats. Much research has been conducted on bat virology, particularly bat immune response. Bats' immune systems differ from other mammals in their lack of several inflammasomes, which activate the body's inflammatory response, as well as a dampened stimulator of interferon genes (STING) response, which helps control host response to pathogens. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. A 2015 review found that bats do not harbor more zoonotic viruses than primates or rodents, though the three groups harbored more than other mammal orders. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals.

Viral diversity

Viruses have been found in bat populations around the world. Bats harbor all groups of viruses in the Baltimore classification, representing at least 28 families of viruses. Most of the viruses harbored by bats are RNA viruses, though they are also known to have DNA viruses. Bats are more tolerant of viruses than terrestrial mammals. A single bat can host several different kinds of viruses without becoming ill. Bats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity. Their behavior and life history also make them "exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement.

Though bats harbor diverse viruses, they are rarely lethal to the bat host. Only the rabies virus and a few other lyssaviruses have been confirmed to kill bats. Various factors have been implicated in bats' ability to survive viral infections. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Flight produces a fever-like response, resulting in elevated temperature (up to ) and metabolic rate. Additionally, this fever-like response may help them cope with actual fevers upon getting a viral infection. Some research indicates that bats' immune systems have allowed them to cope with a variety of viruses. A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened STING response compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. STING is a signaling molecule that helps coordinate various host defense genes against pathogens. The authors of the study concluded that "the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses."

Additionally, bats lack several inflammasomes found in other mammals; other inflammasomes are present with a greatly reduced response. While inflammation is an immune response to viruses, excessive inflammation is damaging to the body, and viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are known to kill humans by inducing excessive inflammation. Bats' immune systems may have evolved to be more tolerant of stressors such as viral infections compared to other mammals.

Transmission to humans

The vast majority of bat viruses have no zoonotic potential, meaning they cannot be transmitted to humans. The zoonotic viruses have four possible routes of transmission to humans: contact with bat body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, feces); intermediate hosts; environmental exposure; and blood-feeding arthropods. Lyssaviruses like the rabies virus are transmitted from bats to humans via biting. Transmission of most other viruses does not appear to take place via biting, however. Contact with bat fluids such as guano, urine, and saliva is an important source of spillover from bats to humans. Other mammals may play a role in transmitting bat viruses to people, with pig farms a source of bat-borne viruses in Malaysia and Australia. Other possible transmission routes of bat-borne viruses are more speculative. It is possible but unconfirmed that hunting, butchering, and consuming bat meat can result in viral spillover. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. There is little evidence of environmental transmission of viruses from bats to humans, meaning that bat-borne virus do not persist in the environment for long. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the subject.

Bats compared to other viral reservoirs
Bats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal orders, an example of research bias. A 2015 review found that from 1999 to 2013, there were 300–1200 papers published about bat viruses annually, compared to 12–45 publications for marsupial viruses and only 1–9 studies for sloth viruses. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). A 2020 review of mammals and birds found that the identity of the taxonomic groups did not have any impact on the probability of harboring zoonotic viruses. Instead, more diverse groups had greater viral diversity. Bat life history traits and immunity, while likely influential in determining bat viral communities, were not associated with a greater probability of viral spillover into humans.

Sampling
Bats are sampled for viruses in a variety of ways. They can be tested for seropositivity for a given virus using a method like ELISA, which determines whether or not they have the corresponding antibodies for the virus. They can also be surveyed using molecular detection techniques like PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which can be used to replicate and amplify viral sequences. Histopathology, which is the microscopic examination of tissue, can also be used. Viruses have been isolated from bat blood, saliva, feces, tissue, and urine. Some sampling is non-invasive and does not require killing the bat for sampling, whereas other sampling requires sacrificing the animal first. A 2016 review found no significant difference in total number of viruses found and new viruses discovered between lethal and non-lethal studies. Several species of threatened bat have been killed for viral sampling, including the Comoro rousette, Hildegarde's tomb bat, Natal free-tailed bat, and the long-fingered bat.

Double-stranded DNA viruses

Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses have been detected in bat guano, urine, and oral and rectal swabs. They have been found in both megabats and microbats across a large geographic area. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. The greatest diversity of bat adenoviruses has been found in Eurasia, though the virus family may be undersampled in bats overall.

Herpesviruses
Diverse herpesviruses have been found in bats in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe, including representatives of the three subfamilies, alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Bat-hosted herpesviruses include the species Pteropodid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1.

Papillomaviruses
Papillomaviruses were first detected in bats in 2006, in the Egyptian fruit bat. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. Five distinct lineages of bat papillomaviruses have been recognized.

Single-stranded DNA viruses

Anelloviruses
No anellovirus is known to cause disease in humans. The first bat anellovirus, a Torque teno virus, was found in a Mexican free-tailed bat. Novel anelloviruses have also been detected in two leaf-nosed bat species: the common vampire bat and Seba's short-tailed bat. The bat anelloviruses and one opossum anellovirus have been included in the proposed genus Sigmatorquevirus.

Circoviruses
Circoviruses, family Circoviridae, are among the most diverse of all viruses. Like anelloviruses, circoviruses are not associated with any disease in humans. About a third of all circoviruses are associated with bats, found in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. A study of horseshoe and vesper bats in China identified circoviruses from the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus.

Parvoviruses
Several kinds of parvoviruses are considered important for human and animal health. Several strains of parvovirus have been identified from bat guano in the US states of Texas and California. Serum analysis of the straw-colored fruit bat and Jamaican fruit bat led to the identification of two new parvoviruses. Bat parvoviruses are in the subfamily Parvovirinae, closely resembling the genera Protoparvovirus, Erythrovirus, and Bocaparvovirus.

Double-stranded RNA viruses

Reoviruses

Zoonotic
Some disease-causing reovirus species are associated with bats. One such virus is Melaka virus, which was linked to illness in a Malaysian man and his two children in 2006. The man said that a bat had been in his home a week before he became ill, and the virus was closely related to other reoviruses linked to bats. Kampar virus was identified a few months later in another Malaysian man. Though he had no known contact with bats, Kampar virus is closely related to Melaka virus. Several other reovirus strains identified in ill humans are known as Miyazaki‐Bali/2007, Sikamat virus, and SI‐MRV01. No reoviruses linked to bats have caused death in humans.

Other

Reoviruses include many viruses that do not cause disease in humans, including several found in bats. One reovirus species associated with bats is Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, sometimes called Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), which is an orthoreovirus; several virus strains of it have been identified in bats. The type member of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus is Nelson Bay virus (NBV), which was first identified in 1970 from the blood of a gray-headed flying fox in New South Wales, Australia. NBV was the first reovirus to be isolated from a bat species. Another strain of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus associated with bats is Pulau virus, which was first identified from the small flying fox of Tioman Island in 2006. Other viruses include Broome orthoreovirus from the little red flying fox of Broome, Western Australia; Xi River virus from Leschenault's rousette in Guangdong, China; and Cangyuan  virus also from Leschenault's rousette. Several mammalian orthoreoviruses are associated with bats, including at least three from Germany and 19 from Italy. These were found in pipistrelles, the brown long-eared bat, and the whiskered bat.

Orbiviruses have been isolated from bats, including Ife virus from the straw-colored fruit bat, Japanaut  virus from the common blossom bat, and Fomédé  virus from Nycteris species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Astroviruses
Astroviruses have been found in several genera of bat in the Old World, including Miniopterus, Myotis, Hipposideros, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Scotophilus, and Taphozous, though none in Africa. Bats have very high prevalence rates of astroviruses; studies in Hong Kong and mainland China found prevalence rates approaching 50% from anal swabs. No astroviruses identified in bats are associated with disease in humans.

Caliciviruses
Bat caliciviruses were first identified in Hong Kong in the Pomona roundleaf bat, and were later identified from tricolored bats in the US state of Maryland. Bat caliciviruses are similar to the genera Sapovirus and Valovirus, with noroviruses also detected from two microbat species in China.

Coronaviruses

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV

Several zoonotic coronaviruses are associated with bats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is another zoonotic coronavirus likely originating in bats. SARS-CoV causes the disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The first documented case of SARS was in November 2002 in Foshan, China. It became an epidemic, affecting 28 countries around the world with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was identified as bats, with the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat considered a particularly strong candidate after a coronavirus was recovered from a colony that had 95% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. There is uncertainty on whether or not animals like palm civets and raccoon dogs were intermediate hosts that facilitated the spread of the virus from bats to humans, or if humans acquired the virus directly from bats.

The first human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was in June 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of November 2019, 2,494 cases of MERS have been reported in twenty-seven countries, resulting in 858 fatalities. It is believed that MERS-CoV originated in bats, though camels are likely the intermediate host through which humans became infected. Human-to-human transmission is possible, though does not easily occur.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in humans started in Wuhan, China in 2019. Genetic analyses of SARS-COV-2 showed that it was highly similar to viruses found in horseshoe bats, with 96% similarity to a virus isolated from the intermediate horseshoe bat. Due to similarity with known bat coronaviruses, data "clearly indicates" that the natural reservoirs of SARS-COV-2 are bats. It is yet unclear how the virus was transmitted to humans, though an intermediate host may have been involved. Phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the strain that caused a human pandemic diverged from the strain found in bats decades ago, likely between 1950 and 1980.

Other
Bats harbor a great diversity of coronaviruses, with sampling by the EcoHealth Alliance in China alone identifying about 400 new strains of coronavirus. A study of coronavirus diversity harbored by bats in eastern Thailand revealed forty-seven coronaviruses.

Flaviviruses

Most flaviviruses are transmitted via arthropods, but bats may play a role in the ecology of some species. Several strains of Dengue virus have been found in bats in the Americas, and West Nile virus has been identified in fruit bats in South India. Serological studies indicate that West Nile virus may also be present in bats in North America and the Yucatán Peninsula. Saint Louis encephalitis virus has been detected in bats in the US states of Texas and Ohio, as well as the Yucatán Peninsula. Japanese encephalitis virus or its associated antibodies have been found in several bat species throughout Asia. Other flaviviruses detected in bats include Sepik virus, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Yokose virus, Dakar bat virus, Bukalasa bat virus,  Carey Island virus, Phnom Penh bat virus,  Rio Bravo bat virus,  Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus, and Tamana bat virus.

Picornaviruses
Several genera of picornaviruses have been found in bats, including Kobuvirus, Sapelovirus, Cardiovirus, and Senecavirus. Picornaviruses have been identified from a diverse array of bat species around the world.

Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Arenaviruses
Arenaviruses are mainly associated with rodents, though some can cause illness in humans. The first arenavirus identified in bats was Tacaribe mammarenavirus, which was isolated from Jamaican fruit bats and the great fruit-eating bat. Antibody response associated with Tacaribe virus has also been found in the common vampire bat, the little yellow-shouldered bat, and Heller's broad-nosed bat. It is unclear if bats are the natural reservoir of Tacaribe virus. There has been one known human infection by Tacaribe virus, though it was accidentally acquired in a laboratory setting.

Hantaviruses
Hantaviruses, family Hantaviridae, naturally occur in vertebrates. All bat-associated hantaviruses are in the subfamily Mammantavirinae. Of the four genera within the subfamily, Loanvirus and Mobatvirus are the genera that have been documented in various bats. Almost all bat hantaviruses have been identified from microbats. Mouyassue virus has been identified from the banana pipistrelle in Ivory Coast and the Cape serotine in Ethiopia; Magboi virus from the hairy slit-faced bat in Sierra Leone; Xuan Son virus from the Pomona roundleaf bat in Vietnam; Huangpi virus from the Japanese house bat in China; Longquan loanvirus from several horseshoe bats in China; Makokou virus from Noack's roundleaf bat in Gabon; Đakrông virus from Stoliczka's trident bat in Vietnam; Brno loanvirus from the common noctule in the Czech Republic; and Laibin mobatvirus from the black-bearded tomb bat in China. As of 2019, only Quezon mobatvirus has been identified from a megabat, as it was identified from a Geoffroy's rousette in the Philippines. Bat hantaviruses are not associated with illness in humans.

Filoviruses

Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus

Filoviridae is a family of virus containing two genera associated with bats: Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which contain the species that cause Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease, respectively. Though relatively few disease outbreaks are caused by filoviruses, they are of high concern due to their extreme virulence, or capacity to cause harm to their hosts. Filovirus outbreaks typically have high mortality rates in humans. Though the first filovirus was identified in 1967, it took more than twenty years to identify any natural reservoirs.

Ebola virus disease is a relatively rare but life-threatening illness in humans, with an average mortality rate of 50% (though individual outbreaks may be as high as 90% mortality). The first outbreaks were in 1976 in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The natural reservoirs of ebolaviruses are unknown. However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs. Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat. Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates. Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks.

Marburg virus disease (MVD) was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia. MVD is highly virulent, with an average human mortality rate of 50%, but as high as 88% for individual outbreaks. MVD is caused by Marburg virus and the closely related Ravn virus, which was formerly considered synonymous with Marburg virus. Marburg virus was first detected in the Egyptian fruit bat in 2007, which is now recognized as the natural reservoir of the virus. Marburg virus has been detected in Egyptian fruit bats in Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda. Spillover from Egyptian fruit bats occurs when humans spend prolonged time in mines or caves inhabited by the bats, though the exact mechanism of transmission is unclear. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood or semen, or indirectly through contact with bedding or clothing exposed to these fluids.

Other
Lloviu virus, a kind of filovirus in the genus Cuevavirus, has been identified from the common bent-wing bat in Spain. Another filovirus, Bombali ebolavirus, has been isolated from free-tailed bats, including the little free-tailed bat and the Angolan free-tailed bat. Neither Lloviu virus nor Bombali ebolavirus is associated with illness in humans. Genomic RNA associated with Mengla dianlovirus, though not the virus itself, has been identified from Rousettus bats in China.

Rhabdoviruses

Rabies-causing viruses

Lyssaviruses (from the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae) include the rabies virus, Australian bat lyssavirus, and other related viruses, many of which are also harbored by bats. Unlike most other viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, which are transmitted by arthropods, lyssaviruses are transmitted by mammals, most frequently through biting. All mammals are susceptible to lyssaviruses, though bats and carnivores are the most common natural reservoirs. The vast majority of human rabies cases are a result of the rabies virus, with only twelve other human cases attributed to other lyssaviruses as of 2015. These rarer lyssaviruses associated with bats include Duvenhage lyssavirus (three human cases as of 2015); European bat 1 lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015); European bat 2 lyssavirus (two human cases as of 2015); and Irkut lyssavirus (one human case as of 2015). Microbats are suspected as the reservoirs of these four uncommon lyssaviruses.

After transmission has occurred, the average human is asymptomatic for two months, though the incubation period can be as short as a week or as long as several years.
Italian scientist Antonio Carini was the first to hypothesize that rabies virus could be transmitted by bats, which he did in 1911. This same conclusion was reached by Hélder Queiroz in 1934 and Joseph Lennox Pawan in 1936. Vampire bats were the first to be documented with rabies; in 1953, an insectivorous bat in Florida was discovered with rabies, making it the first documented occurrence in an insectivorous species outside the vampire bats' ranges. Bats have an overall low prevalence of rabies virus, with a majority of surveys of apparently healthy individuals showing rabies incidence of 0.0–0.5%. Sick bats are more likely to be submitted for rabies testing than apparently healthy bats, known as sampling bias, with most studies reporting rabies incidence of 5–20% in sick or dead bats. Rabies virus exposure can be fatal in bats, though it is likely that the majority of individuals do not develop the disease after exposure. In non-bat mammals, exposure to the rabies virus almost always leads to death.

Globally, dogs are by far the most common source of human rabies deaths. Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia. Many feeding guilds of bats may transmit rabies to humans, including insectivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, omnivorous, sanguivorous, and carnivorous species. The common vampire bat is a source of human rabies in Central and South America, though the frequency at which humans are bitten is poorly understood. Between 1993 and 2002, the majority of human rabies cases associated with bats in the Americas were the result of non-vampire bats. In North America, about half of human rabies instances are cryptic, meaning that the patient has no known bite history. While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, "investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission". It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite. Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin.

Other
Many bat lyssaviruses are not associated with infection in humans. These include Lagos bat lyssavirus, Shimoni bat lyssavirus, Khujand lyssavirus, Aravan lyssavirus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, West Caucasian bat lyssavirus, and Lleida bat lyssavirus. Lagos bat lyssavirus, also known as Lagos bat virus (LBV), has been isolated from a megabat in sub-Saharan Africa. This lyssavirus has four distinct lineages, all of which are found in the straw-colored fruit bat.

Rhabdoviruses from other genera have been identified in bats. This includes several from the genus Ledantevirus: Kern Canyon virus, which was found in the Yuma myotis in California (US); Kolente virus from the Jones's roundleaf bat in Guinea; Mount Elgon bat virus from the eloquent horseshoe bat in Kenya; Oita virus from the little Japanese horseshoe bat; and Fikirini virus from the striped leaf-nosed bat in Kenya.

Orthomyxoviruses

Orthomyxoviruses include influenza viruses. While birds are the primary reservoir for the genus Alphainfluenzavirus, a few bat species in Central and South America have also tested positive for the viruses. These species include the little yellow-shouldered bat and the flat-faced fruit-eating bat. Bat populations tested in Guatemala and Peru had high seropositivity rates, which suggests that influenza A infections are common among bats in the New World.

Paramyxoviruses

Hendra, Nipah, and Menangle viruses

Paramyxoviridae is a family that includes several zoonotic viruses naturally found in bats. Two are in the genus Henipavirus—Hendra virus and Nipah virus. Hendra virus was first identified in 1994 in Hendra, Australia. Four different species of flying fox have tested positive for Hendra virus: the gray-headed flying fox, little red flying fox, spectacled flying fox, and black flying fox. Horses are the intermediate host between flying foxes and humans. Between 1994 and 2014, there were fifty-five outbreaks of Hendra virus in Australia, resulting in the death or euthanization of eighty-eight horses. Seven humans are known to have been infected by Hendra virus, with four fatalities. Six of the seven infected humans were directly exposed to the blood or other fluids of sick or dead horses (three were veterinarians), while the seventh case was a veterinary nurse who had recently irrigated the nasal cavity of a horse not yet exhibiting symptoms. It is unclear how horses become infected with Hendra virus, though it is believed to occur following direct exposure to flying fox fluids. There is also evidence of horse-to-horse transmission. In late 2012, a vaccine was released to prevent infection in horses. Vaccine uptake has been low, with an estimated 11–17% of Australian horses vaccinated by 2017.

The first human outbreak of Nipah virus was in 1998 in Malaysia. It was determined that flying foxes were also the reservoir of the virus, with domestic pigs as the intermediate host between bats and humans. Outbreaks have also occurred in Bangladesh, India, Singapore, and the Philippines. In Bangladesh, the primary mode of transmission of Nipah virus to humans is through the consumption of date palm sap. Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and guano, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots. It has been speculated that the virus may also be transmitted to humans by eating fruit partially consumed by flying foxes, or by coming into contact with their urine, though no definitive evidence supports this.

An additional zoonotic paramyxovirus that bats harbor is Menangle virus, which was first identified at a hog farm in New South Wales, Australia. Flying foxes were once again identified as the natural reservoirs of the virus, with the black, spectacled, and gray-headed seropositive for the virus. Two employees of the hog farm became sick with flu-like illnesses, later shown to be a result of the virus. Sosuga pararubulavirus is known to have infected one person—an American wildlife biologist who had conducted bat and rodent research in Uganda. The Egyptian fruit bat later tested positive for the virus, indicating that it is potentially a natural reservoir.

Other
Bats host several paramyxoviruses that are not known to affect humans. Bats are the reservoir of Cedar virus, a paramyxovirus first discovered in flying foxes South East Queensland. The zoonotic potential of Cedar virus is unknown. In Brazil in 1979, Mapuera orthorubulavirus was isolated from the saliva of the little yellow-shouldered bat. Mapuera virus has never been associated with disease in other animals or humans, but experimental exposure of mice to the virus resulted in fatality. Tioman pararubulavirus has been isolated from the urine of the small flying fox, which causes fever in some domestic pigs after exposure, but no other symptoms. Tukoko virus has been detected from Leschenault's rousette in China. Bats have been suggested as the host of Porcine orthorubulavirus, though definitive evidence has not been collected.

Togaviruses
Togaviruses include alphaviruses, which have been detected in bats. Alphaviruses cause encephalitis in humans. Alphaviruses that have been detected in bats include Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus. Sindbis virus has been detected from horseshoe bats and roundleaf bats. Chikungunya virus has been isolated from Leschenault's rousette, the Egyptian fruit bat, Sundevall's roundleaf bat, the little free-tailed bat, and Scotophilus species.

Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate

Retroviruses
Bats can be infected with retroviruses, including the gammaretrovirus found in horseshoe bats, Leschenault's rousette, and the greater false vampire bat. Several bat retroviruses have been identified that are similar to the Reticuloendotheliosis virus found in birds. These retroviruses were found in mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. The discovery of varied and distinct gammaretroviruses in bat genomes indicates that bats likely played important roles in their diversification. Bats also host an extensive number of betaretroviruses, including within mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. Bat betaretroviruses span the entire breadth of betaretrovirus diversity, similar to those of rodents, which may indicate that bats and rodents are primary reservoirs of the viruses. Betaretroviruses have infected bats for a majority of bat evolutionary history, since at least 36 million years ago.

Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate

Hepadnaviruses
Hepadnaviruses are also known to affect bats, with the tent-making bat, Noack's roundleaf bat, and the halcyon horseshoe bat known to harbor several. The hepadnovirus found in the tent-making bat, which is a New World species, was the closest relative of human hepadnoviruses. Though relatively few hepadnaviruses have been identified in bats, it is highly likely that additional strains will be discovered through further research. As of 2016, they had been found in four bat families: Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera and Molossidae and Vespertilionidae from Yangochiroptera. The high diversity of bat hosts suggests that bats share a long evolutionary history with hepadnaviruses, indicating bats may have had an important role in hepadnavirus evolution.

[2024-06-12 05:22:45,074] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. Bats are the only mammal capable of true flight. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic, or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated. Despite the abundance of viruses associated with bats, they rarely become ill from viral infections, and rabies is the only viral illness known to kill bats. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. A 2015 review found that bats do not harbor more zoonotic viruses than primates or rodents, though the three groups harbored more than other mammal orders. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals. Viral diversity

Viruses have been found in bat populations around the world. Bats harbor all groups of viruses in the Baltimore classification, representing at least 28 families of viruses. Most of the viruses harbored by bats are RNA viruses, though they are also known to have DNA viruses. Bats are more tolerant of viruses than terrestrial mammals. A single bat can host several different kinds of viruses without becoming ill. Bats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity. Their behavior and life history also make them "exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement. Though bats harbor diverse viruses, they are rarely lethal to the bat host. Various factors have been implicated in bats' ability to survive viral infections. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Some research indicates that bats' immune systems have allowed them to cope with a variety of viruses. A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened STING response compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. Additionally, bats lack several inflammasomes found in other mammals; other inflammasomes are present with a greatly reduced response. Bats' immune systems may have evolved to be more tolerant of stressors such as viral infections compared to other mammals. Transmission to humans

The vast majority of bat viruses have no zoonotic potential, meaning they cannot be transmitted to humans. The zoonotic viruses have four possible routes of transmission to humans: contact with bat body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, feces); intermediate hosts; environmental exposure; and blood-feeding arthropods. Other mammals may play a role in transmitting bat viruses to people, with pig farms a source of bat-borne viruses in Malaysia and Australia. It is possible but unconfirmed that hunting, butchering, and consuming bat meat can result in viral spillover. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. Bats compared to other viral reservoirs
Bats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal orders, an example of research bias. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). Sampling
Bats are sampled for viruses in a variety of ways. Some sampling is non-invasive and does not require killing the bat for sampling, whereas other sampling requires sacrificing the animal first. Double-stranded DNA viruses

Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses have been detected in bat guano, urine, and oral and rectal swabs. They have been found in both megabats and microbats across a large geographic area. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. The greatest diversity of bat adenoviruses has been found in Eurasia, though the virus family may be undersampled in bats overall. Bat-hosted herpesviruses include the species Pteropodid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. The first bat anellovirus, a Torque teno virus, was found in a Mexican free-tailed bat. The bat anelloviruses and one opossum anellovirus have been included in the proposed genus Sigmatorquevirus. About a third of all circoviruses are associated with bats, found in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. A study of horseshoe and vesper bats in China identified circoviruses from the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus. Double-stranded RNA viruses

Reoviruses

Zoonotic
Some disease-causing reovirus species are associated with bats. The man said that a bat had been in his home a week before he became ill, and the virus was closely related to other reoviruses linked to bats. Though he had no known contact with bats, Kampar virus is closely related to Melaka virus. One reovirus species associated with bats is Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, sometimes called Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), which is an orthoreovirus; several virus strains of it have been identified in bats. The type member of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus is Nelson Bay virus (NBV), which was first identified in 1970 from the blood of a gray-headed flying fox in New South Wales, Australia. These were found in pipistrelles, the brown long-eared bat, and the whiskered bat. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Astroviruses
Astroviruses have been found in several genera of bat in the Old World, including Miniopterus, Myotis, Hipposideros, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Scotophilus, and Taphozous, though none in Africa. Bats have very high prevalence rates of astroviruses; studies in Hong Kong and mainland China found prevalence rates approaching 50% from anal swabs. No astroviruses identified in bats are associated with disease in humans. Bat caliciviruses are similar to the genera Sapovirus and Valovirus, with noroviruses also detected from two microbat species in China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is another zoonotic coronavirus likely originating in bats. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was identified as bats, with the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat considered a particularly strong candidate after a coronavirus was recovered from a colony that had 95% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. There is uncertainty on whether or not animals like palm civets and raccoon dogs were intermediate hosts that facilitated the spread of the virus from bats to humans, or if humans acquired the virus directly from bats. It is believed that MERS-CoV originated in bats, though camels are likely the intermediate host through which humans became infected. Flaviviruses

Most flaviviruses are transmitted via arthropods, but bats may play a role in the ecology of some species. Serological studies indicate that West Nile virus may also be present in bats in North America and the Yucatán Peninsula. Picornaviruses
Several genera of picornaviruses have been found in bats, including Kobuvirus, Sapelovirus, Cardiovirus, and Senecavirus. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Arenaviruses
Arenaviruses are mainly associated with rodents, though some can cause illness in humans. Antibody response associated with Tacaribe virus has also been found in the common vampire bat, the little yellow-shouldered bat, and Heller's broad-nosed bat. It is unclear if bats are the natural reservoir of Tacaribe virus. All bat-associated hantaviruses are in the subfamily Mammantavirinae. Of the four genera within the subfamily, Loanvirus and Mobatvirus are the genera that have been documented in various bats. Filoviruses

Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus

Filoviridae is a family of virus containing two genera associated with bats: Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which contain the species that cause Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease, respectively. However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs. Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat. Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates. Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks. Spillover from Egyptian fruit bats occurs when humans spend prolonged time in mines or caves inhabited by the bats, though the exact mechanism of transmission is unclear. Genomic RNA associated with Mengla dianlovirus, though not the virus itself, has been identified from Rousettus bats in China. All mammals are susceptible to lyssaviruses, though bats and carnivores are the most common natural reservoirs. Microbats are suspected as the reservoirs of these four uncommon lyssaviruses. Vampire bats were the first to be documented with rabies; in 1953, an insectivorous bat in Florida was discovered with rabies, making it the first documented occurrence in an insectivorous species outside the vampire bats' ranges. Sick bats are more likely to be submitted for rabies testing than apparently healthy bats, known as sampling bias, with most studies reporting rabies incidence of 5–20% in sick or dead bats. In non-bat mammals, exposure to the rabies virus almost always leads to death. Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia. Many feeding guilds of bats may transmit rabies to humans, including insectivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, omnivorous, sanguivorous, and carnivorous species. In North America, about half of human rabies instances are cryptic, meaning that the patient has no known bite history. While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, "investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission". It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite. While birds are the primary reservoir for the genus Alphainfluenzavirus, a few bat species in Central and South America have also tested positive for the viruses. These species include the little yellow-shouldered bat and the flat-faced fruit-eating bat. Bat populations tested in Guatemala and Peru had high seropositivity rates, which suggests that influenza A infections are common among bats in the New World. Paramyxoviruses

Hendra, Nipah, and Menangle viruses

Paramyxoviridae is a family that includes several zoonotic viruses naturally found in bats. Horses are the intermediate host between flying foxes and humans. It was determined that flying foxes were also the reservoir of the virus, with domestic pigs as the intermediate host between bats and humans. Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and guano, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots. Flying foxes were once again identified as the natural reservoirs of the virus, with the black, spectacled, and gray-headed seropositive for the virus. The Egyptian fruit bat later tested positive for the virus, indicating that it is potentially a natural reservoir. Bats are the reservoir of Cedar virus, a paramyxovirus first discovered in flying foxes South East Queensland. Bats have been suggested as the host of Porcine orthorubulavirus, though definitive evidence has not been collected. Togaviruses
Togaviruses include alphaviruses, which have been detected in bats. Alphaviruses that have been detected in bats include Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate

Retroviruses
Bats can be infected with retroviruses, including the gammaretrovirus found in horseshoe bats, Leschenault's rousette, and the greater false vampire bat. The discovery of varied and distinct gammaretroviruses in bat genomes indicates that bats likely played important roles in their diversification. Bats also host an extensive number of betaretroviruses, including within mouse-eared bats, horseshoe bats, and flying foxes. Bat betaretroviruses span the entire breadth of betaretrovirus diversity, similar to those of rodents, which may indicate that bats and rodents are primary reservoirs of the viruses. Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate

Hepadnaviruses
Hepadnaviruses are also known to affect bats, with the tent-making bat, Noack's roundleaf bat, and the halcyon horseshoe bat known to harbor several. As of 2016, they had been found in four bat families: Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera and Molossidae and Vespertilionidae from Yangochiroptera. See also

 Male lesser mouse-tailed bats mature at sixteen to seventeen months of age. Gestation in gray bats lasts 60 to 70 days, with birth occurring in late May and early June. Gray bat females give birth to one offspring per clutch (bout of reproduction), thus giving birth to one offspring per year. Therefore, gray bats demonstrate an iteroparous life-history strategy.

Answer:
2024-06-12 05:22:45 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. Bats are the only mammal capable of true flight. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. Bats harbor several viruses that are zoonotic, or capable of infecting humans, and some bat-borne viruses are considered important emerging viruses. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. It has been speculated that bats may have a role in the ecology of the Ebola virus, though this is unconfirmed. There is no firm evidence that butchering or consuming bat meat can lead to viral transmission, though this has been speculated. Despite the abundance of viruses associated with bats, they rarely become ill from viral infections, and rabies is the only viral illness known to kill bats. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. A 2015 review found that bats do not harbor more zoonotic viruses than primates or rodents, though the three groups harbored more than other mammal orders. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals. Viral diversity

Viruses have been found in bat populations around the world. Bats harbor all groups of viruses in the Baltimore classification, representing at least 28 families of viruses. Most of the viruses harbored by bats are RNA viruses, though they are also known to have DNA viruses. Bats are more tolerant of viruses than terrestrial mammals. A single bat can host several different kinds of viruses without becoming ill. Bats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity. Their behavior and life history also make them "exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement. Though bats harbor diverse viruses, they are rarely lethal to the bat host. Various factors have been implicated in bats' ability to survive viral infections. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Some research indicates that bats' immune systems have allowed them to cope with a variety of viruses. A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened STING response compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. Additionally, bats lack several inflammasomes found in other mammals; other inflammasomes are present with a greatly reduced response. Bats' immune systems may have evolved to be more tolerant of stressors such as viral infections compared to other mammals. Transmission to humans

The vast majority of bat viruses have no zoonotic potential, meaning they cannot be transmitted to humans. The zoonotic viruses have four possible routes of transmission to humans: contact with bat body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, feces); intermediate hosts; environmental exposure; and blood-feeding arthropods. Other mammals may play a role in transmitting bat viruses to people, with pig farms a source of bat-borne viruses in Malaysia and Australia. It is possible but unconfirmed that hunting, butchering, and consuming bat meat can result in viral spillover. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. Bats compared to other viral reservoirs
Bats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal orders, an example of research bias. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). Sampling
Bats are sampled for viruses in a variety of ways. Some sampling is non-invasive and does not require killing the bat for sampling, whereas other sampling requires sacrificing the animal first. Double-stranded DNA viruses

Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses have been detected in bat guano, urine, and oral and rectal swabs. They have been found in both megabats and microbats across a large geographic area. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. The greatest diversity of bat adenoviruses has been found in Eurasia, though the virus family may be undersampled in bats overall. Bat-hosted herpesviruses include the species Pteropodid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. The first bat anellovirus, a Torque teno virus, was found in a Mexican free-tailed bat. The bat anelloviruses and one opossum anellovirus have been included in the proposed genus Sigmatorquevirus. About a third of all circoviruses are associated with bats, found in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. A study of horseshoe and vesper bats in China identified circoviruses from the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus. Double-stranded RNA viruses

Reoviruses

Zoonotic
Some disease-causing reovirus species are associated with bats. The man said that a bat had been in his home a week before he became ill, and the virus was closely related to other reoviruses linked to bats. Though he had no known contact with bats, Kampar virus is closely related to Melaka virus. One reovirus species associated with bats is Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, sometimes called Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV), which is an orthoreovirus; several virus strains of it have been identified in bats. The type member of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus is Nelson Bay virus (NBV), which was first identified in 1970 from the blood of a gray-headed flying fox in New South Wales, Australia. These were found in pipistrelles, the brown long-eared bat, and the whiskered bat. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Astroviruses
Astroviruses have been found in several genera of bat in the Old World, including Miniopterus, Myotis, Hipposideros, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Scotophilus, and Taphozous, though none in Africa. Bats have very high prevalence rates of astroviruses; studies in Hong Kong and mainland China found prevalence rates approaching 50% from anal swabs. No astroviruses identified in bats are associated with disease in humans. Bat caliciviruses are similar to the genera Sapovirus and Valovirus, with noroviruses also detected from two microbat species in China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is another zoonotic coronavirus likely originating in bats. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was identified as bats, with the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat considered a particularly strong candidate after a coronavirus was recovered from a colony that had 95% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. There is uncertainty on whether or not animals like palm civets and raccoon dogs were intermediate hosts that facilitated the spread of the virus from bats to humans, or if humans acquired the virus directly from bats. It is believed that MERS-CoV originated in bats, though camels are likely the intermediate host through which humans became infected. Flaviviruses

Most flaviviruses are transmitted via arthropods, but bats may play a role in the ecology of some species. Serological studies indicate that West Nile virus may also be present in bats in North America and the Yucatán Peninsula. Picornaviruses
Several genera of picornaviruses have been found in bats, including Kobuvirus, Sapelovirus, Cardiovirus, and Senecavirus. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses

Arenaviruses
Arenaviruses are mainly associated with rodents, though some can cause illness in humans. Antibody response associated with Tacaribe virus has also been found in the common vampire bat, the little yellow-shouldered bat, and Heller's broad-nosed bat. It is unclear if bats are the natural reservoir of Tacaribe virus. All bat-associated hantaviruses are in the subfamily Mammantavirinae. Of the four genera within the subfamily, Loanvirus and Mobatvirus are the genera that have been documented in various bats. Filoviruses

Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus

Filoviridae is a family of virus containing two genera associated with bats: Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which contain the species that cause Marburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease, respectively. However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs. Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat. Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates. Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks. Spillover from Egyptian fruit bats occurs when humans spend prolonged time in mines or caves inhabited by the bats, though the exact mechanism of transmission is unclear. Genomic RNA associated with Mengla dianlovirus, though not the virus itself, has been identified from Rousettus bats in China. All mammals are susceptible to lyssaviruses, though bats and carnivores are the most common natural reservoirs. Microbats are suspected as the reservoirs of these four uncommon lyssaviruses. Vampire bats were the first to be documented with rabies; in 1953, an insectivorous bat in Florida was discovered with rabies, making it the first documented occurrence in an insectivorous species outside the vampire bats' ranges. Sick bats are more likely to be submitted for rabies testing than apparently healthy bats, known as sampling bias, with most studies reporting rabies incidence of 5–20% in sick or dead bats. In non-bat mammals, exposure to the rabies virus almost always leads to death. Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia.

   A gemstone (also called a fine gem, jewel, precious stone, or semi-precious stone) is a piece of mineral crystal which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. However, certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli and opal) and occasionally organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value. Rarity and notoriety are other characteristics that lend value to gemstones. Apart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity engraved gems and hardstone carvings, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a lapidary or gemcutter; a diamond cutter is called a diamantaire.

   Blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration, as well as language and literature. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments. The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite.

  Diamond is one of the best-known and most sought-after gemstones. They have been used as decorative items since ancient times. The hardness of diamond and its high dispersion of light—giving the diamond its characteristic "fire"—make it useful for industrial applications and desirable as jewellery. Diamonds are such a highly traded commodity that multiple organizations have been created for grading and certifying them based on the "four Cs", which are color, cut, clarity, and carat. Other characteristics, such as presence or lack of fluorescence, also affect the desirability and thus the value of a diamond used for jewelry. Diamonds are used in engagement rings.

   Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience, which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica,

   Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz. The name comes from the Koine Greek αμέθυστος amethystos from α- a-, "not" and μεθύσκω (Ancient Greek) methysko / μεθώ metho (Modern Greek), "intoxicate", a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness. Ancient Greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication. Amethyst, a semiprecious stone, is often used in jewelry and is the traditional birthstone for February.

  Amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light lavender or pale violet, to a deep purple. Amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues, red and blue. High quality amethyst can be found in Siberia, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Uruguay, and the Far East. The ideal grade is called "Deep Siberian" and has a primary purple hue of around 75–80%, with 15–20% blue and (depending on the light source) red secondary hues. ‘Rose de France’ is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple, reminiscent of a lavender/lilac shade.

  inclusions and appears hazy; non-hazy specimens are specially referred to as "milky". Thus, adularescence occurring in non-adularia gemstones is termed differently – the "girasol effect" and opalescence (for opals only) are two such terms. When the schiller forms an indistinct band, it is said to display a chatoyant effect. Only clearly defined bands are referred to as "cat's eyes". As an optical phenomenon, adularescence exists only in the presence of light; it is a product of the interaction between light and the internal microstructures of the mineral and not a property of the mineral itself. The effect is produced by alternating layers of two types at a scale near the wavelength of light (approximately 0.5 micron) – this leads to light scattering and interference.

Thus, adularescence occurring in non-adularia gemstones is termed differently – the "girasol effect" and opalescence (for opals only) are two such terms. When the schiller forms an indistinct band, it is said to display a chatoyant effect. Only clearly defined bands are referred to as "cat's eyes". As an optical phenomenon, adularescence exists only in the presence of light; it is a product of the interaction between light and the internal microstructures of the mineral and not a property of the mineral itself. The effect is produced by alternating layers of two types at a scale near the wavelength of light (approximately 0.5 micron) – this leads to light scattering and interference.

The hardness of diamond and its high dispersion of light—giving the diamond its characteristic "fire"—make it useful for industrial applications and desirable as jewellery. Diamonds are such a highly traded commodity that multiple organizations have been created for grading and certifying them based on the "four Cs", which are color, cut, clarity, and carat. Other characteristics, such as presence or lack of fluorescence, also affect the desirability and thus the value of a diamond used for jewelry. Diamonds are used in engagement rings.

['D. Pine Needles\n\nPine needles, also known as pine needles, are a renewable and sustainable source of biofuel. They are abundant in forests and can be easily harvested without causing any harm to the environment. Pine needles contain a high concentration of lignin, a complex organic polymer that can be converted into biofuel through a process called gasification.\n\nGasification involves heating pine needles in the absence of oxygen to produce a gas that can be used as a fuel. The gas produced during gasification is called syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Syngas can be used to generate electricity, heat buildings, and power vehicles.\n\nPine needles are an excellent source of biofuel because they are readily available, have a low cost, and do not require any special equipment to harvest. They also have a low carbon footprint, as they are a natural byproduct of forest management.\n\nIn addition to being a renewable and sustainable source of biofuel, pine needles also have other benefits. They can be used as a natural fertilizer, as they contain nutrients that can help improve soil quality. They can also be used as a natural mulch, as they help to retain moisture in the soil and prevent erosion.\n\nIn conclusion, pine needles are an', 'What could I use as biofuelWhat could I use as biofuel\nA.

  Pine oil is an essential oil obtained by the steam distillation of stumps, needles, twigs and cones from a variety of species of pine, particularly Pinus sylvestris. As of 1995, synthetic pine oil was the "biggest single turpentine derivative." Synthetic pine oils accounted for 90% of sales as of 2000. It is used as a cleaning product, disinfectant, sanitizer, microbicide (or microbistat), virucide or insecticide. It is an effective herbicide where its action is to modify the waxy cuticle of plants, resulting in desiccation. It is also used as a lubricant in small and expensive clockwork instruments. In alternative medicine it is used in aromatherapy and as a scent in bath oils. Pine oil is distinguished from other products from pine, such as turpentine, the low-boiling fraction from the distillation of pine sap, pine tar, and rosin, a resin remaining after turpentine is distilled. Chemically, pine oil consists mainly of α-terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols. It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters. The exact composition depends on various factors, such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used.

  Douglas-fir wood is used for structural applications that are required to withstand high loads. It is used extensively in the construction industry. Other examples include its use for homebuilt aircraft such as the RJ.03 IBIS canard. Very often, these aircraft were designed to utilize Sitka spruce, which is becoming increasingly difficult to source in aviation quality grades. Oregon pine is also used in boat building when it is available in long, fairly knot-free lengths. Most timber now comes from plantation forests in North America which are managed to produce faster growing timber with fewer knots. This timber is generally lighter but weaker. Traditionally, Oregon pine was used in mast building due to its ability to resist bending loads without fracturing. This was based on using older native

  related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii, Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective. Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released

  As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass (wood, leaves, roots). When trees decompose or burn, much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide, and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils. When a tree is cut and the wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture, the carbon is stored for decades or longer. A typical 2400 sqft home in North America contains 29 metric tonnes of carbon, or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years (about 12,500 litres of gasoline. )When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their

  which predominate. Due to human activity and climate change, the maples, sassafras, and tulip poplar are pushing out the beneficial oak, beech, and hickory. The team determined that the first three tree species, maples, sassafras, and tulip poplar, are associated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria known to "emit reactive nitrogen from soil." By contrast, the second three tree species, oak, beech and hickory, are associated with microbes that "absorb reactive nitrogen oxides," and thus can have a positive impact on the nitrogen oxide component of air quality. Nitrogen oxide release from forest soils is expected to be highest in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky and Ohio.

 Some natural sources of pinene include angelica root oil, anise, star anise, asafetida oil, coriander, cumin, fennel, grapefruit, juniper berries, oils of lavender and lime, mandarin orange leaf, black pepper, peppermint, pimenta, and yarrow. Pine needle oil, derived from various species of Pinus, is also a natural source of pinene and is used as a flavoring agent in pineapple, citrus, and spice flavorings. However, ingestion of large amounts of pine needle oil can cause intestinal hemorrhages, so it is important to use it in appropriate amounts. Pine scotch oil, obtained from pine tree needles, is another natural source of pinene and is used in various flavorings for beverages, candy, and baked goods. Pine tar, a product obtained by distillation of pinewood, is used as an antiseptic in skin diseases and can also be a source of pinene. Pineapple extract and juice, which contain bromelin, a proteindigesting and milk-clotting enzyme, are also natural sources of pinene.

Tocopherols (containing about 9.33 mg of vitamin E per 100 grams) and triacylglycerols are also present at remarkably high levels, providing additional antioxidant protection. Siberian pine seed oil's vitamin E content is about five times higher than that of olive and peanut oils, three times higher than that of almonds, and one and a half times higher than that of walnut oil. Siberian pine oil is also a good source of iodine, which is important for the health of the thyroid gland (in the production of T4). The essential oil content consists of pinene, phellandrene, limonene, and sesquiterpenes. TRADITIONAL USE

Traditionally, the Siberian pine was symbolic of good health, well-being, and longevity. For hundreds of years, the seeds or nuts of the Siberian pine have been used for food as well as a prophylactic remedy for many medical problems. In Russia, Siberian pine seed oil has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for ulcers, gastritis, and digestive ailments. The seed nuclei are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a tonic adaptogen to improve health.

This tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within 2 years.

  Stoves that use natural solid fuel, e.g., wood and other forest debris, have an obvious advantage: the user need not carry any stove fuel on his or her back. This native fuel typically consists of twigs and small pine cones the user gathers at their campsite and places in the fuel chamber of their stove. This substitution of natural fuel for artificial fuel can amount to a savings of several ounces or pounds of fuel and their containers not carried in a traveler's pack, depending on length of trip. Issues of plumbing connections, fuel toxicity, leakage, spillage, and stove flareup are also nonexistent when using a solid-fuel portable stove.

['In a hypothetical world, black bears have been facing a significant decline in their population. Due to habitat loss, hunting, and other human-induced factors, the number of black bears has been decreasing rapidly. As a result, the black bear species is now on the brink of extinction.\n\nAccording to recent studies, the population of black bears has decreased by over 90% in the last century. In some areas, the population has dropped to as low as 10% of its original size. This decline has led to a significant impact on the ecosystem, as black bears play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the forest.\n\nThe black bear species is now classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This classification means that the species is at a high risk of extinction in the wild. If the current trend continues, it is likely that the black bear species will cease to exist in the near future.\n\nThe disappearance of black bears would have a significant impact on the ecosystem. Black bears are important seed dispersers, and their absence would lead to a decline in the number of trees and other vegetation in the forest. This, in turn, would have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem, as many other species depend on the vegetation for food and shelter.\n\nIn addition to their ecological importance, black bears are also cult', 'In a hypothetical world, black bears decrease in numbers until there are zero black bears left on this world.

   Historically, American black bears occupied the majority of North America's forested regions. Today, they are primarily limited to sparsely settled, forested areas. American black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range, though they seldom occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba; they have been extirpated on Prince Edward Island since 1937. The total Canadian black bear population is between 396,000 and 476,000, based on surveys taken in the mid-1990s in seven Canadian provinces, though this estimate excludes American black bear populations in New Brunswick, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. All provinces indicated stable populations of American black bears over the last decade. The current range

  The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is one of the most omnivorous animals in the world and has been recorded consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear. Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Certainly no other animal in their given ecosystems, short perhaps of other bear species and humans, can claim to feed on as broad a range of dietary opportunities. Food that is both abundant and easily obtained is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas

  wild bears in ambient light conditions) directly correlate with their activity levels. The bear keeping track of the changing days allows it to awaken from hibernation at the appropriate time of year to conserve as much energy as possible. The hibernating American black bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity due to ailment or old age. A hibernating American black bear loses approximately half the muscular strength compared to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear's bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, which implies that the bear's

More so, many big mammal species have since become locally extinct and survive only in fractures of their once greater distribution, examples for which include the Eurasian saiga, wapiti-deer, the Asian black bear, the yak, bison, the dhole, lions, the leopard, the jaguar and the giant anteater. While the exact cause of these events remains debated among scientists, it seems clear that this has left ecological niches in Europe, the Middle East, big parts of Asia and the Americas unoccupied, since these species were not replaced by other species with similar characteristics, as it was the case in previous extinction occasions.

  Throughout their range, habitats preferred by American black bears have a few shared characteristics. They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material (especially masts). The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been due to the American black bear having evolved alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct giant short-faced bear and the still-living grizzly bear, that monopolized more open habitats and the historic presence of larger predators, such as Smilodon and the American lion, that could have preyed on American black bears. Although found in the largest numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, American black bears

 In northeastern Wyoming, disease and weather have had a significant impact on the rangeland ecosystem and its associated wildlife communities. The presence of a keystone species, the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), plays a crucial role in creating important grassland habitat for numerous species and serves as prey for predators.

Lethal control driven by agricultural conflict has greatly reduced the abundance of black-tailed prairie dogs, leading to habitat loss for other species. Additionally, the outbreak of epizootic plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) within prairie dog colonies has further decreased their populations. Prairie dogs, being a major food source for certain predators and scavengers, have experienced a decline. This has led to destabilization of the associated wildlife communities.

A study conducted in this area observed the effects of a plague event and abnormally high precipitation. The plague decimated the black-tailed prairie dog populations, reducing the size of the colony complex from over 10,000 hectares to less than 50 hectares. The decline in prairie dog populations had a cascading effect on other species. Mesocarnivores, such as ferruginous hawks, American badgers, and swift foxes, which rely on prairie dogs as a significant part of their diet, experienced dramatic declines in occupancy.

Following the plague outbreak, the area experienced abnormally high precipitation in 2018. This resulted in accelerated vegetation recovery on prairie dog colonies, where constant herbivory had previously maintained a shortgrass structure that was necessary for certain species. The changes in vegetation structure led to significant shifts in avian communities on former prairie dog colonies. Mountain plovers nearly disappeared, while mid-grass associated songbird populations increased.

Therefore, the combined impact of disease, specifically plague, and weather events, such as abnormally high precipitation, has had significant consequences for the rangeland ecosystem in northeastern Wyoming. The decline in black-tailed prairie dog populations has disrupted the balance of the associated wildlife communities, affecting mesocarnivores, raptors, and avian species. These findings highlight the complex interactions between disease, weather, and keystone species within an ecosystem.

  The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. Despite the name, some subspecies can be brown or even blond in coloration. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the American black bear as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear (Ursus arctos), it is one of only two modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction.

Both the Beringian wolf and the dire wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive. One extinction theory holds that the Beringian wolf was outcompeted and replaced by the ancestor of the modern gray wolf. The radiocarbon dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP.

["Bats are fascinating creatures that have developed a unique ability to navigate and locate prey in complete darkness. This ability is called echolocation, and it involves the use of sound waves to create a detailed map of their surroundings.\n\nEcholocation works by emitting high-frequency sounds, which bounce off objects and return to the bat's ears. By analyzing the time it takes for the echo to return, the bat can determine the distance of the object. This is known as time-delay echolocation.\n\nHowever, echolocation cannot detect an object's shape, size, or temperature. While it can provide information about the object's location and distance, it cannot provide a detailed image of the object's shape or size.\n\nIn terms of size, echolocation can only provide an estimate of the object's size based on the strength of the echo. This is because the size of the echo is directly proportional to the size of the object.\n\nIn terms of temperature, echolocation cannot detect an object's temperature. This is because the temperature of an object does not affect the speed of sound waves, which is what echolocation relies on to create a map of the environment.\n\nOverall, echolocation is a remarkable ability that allows bats to navigate and locate prey in complete darkness.

  It lives in groups and the colony may number up to 60 bats. It spends the day taking shelter and roosting in trees, caves, or buildings, and it is a nocturnal species. They tend to return to the same roosting spot every day. After feeding, they usually groom themselves before approaching others. Females leave their young behind while they leave the roost to forage. Flight activity usually peaks in the hour after dark. Although individuals visit the same foraging sites frequently, a high degree of variation exists between sites, which does not seem to be correlated with similarity to roosting sites. Two foraging strategies are used, hunting from a perch or catching prey while in flight. Except when prey density is low, these bats prefer to perch and wait for prey, or to make short flights out to catch

  the net cost of foraging is lower when performed in this way. Because of the broadness of their wings and lower wing loadings, these bats are less adapted to fly over long distances. Although smaller bats are consumed by N. grandis, they are only eaten when they fly into the roosts of N. grandis. N. grandis produces low-intensity echolocation calls at high frequencies, which makes them nearly inaudible except at close range. Instead of relying on echolocation to find their prey, these bats listen for wing fluttering of smaller bats and even insects. However, as N. grandis gets closer to its prey during a hunt, it exudes a louder echolocation call. At the beginning of the pursuit, the call ranges from 17 to 114 kHz, and rises to a range of 61–110 kHz just before the prey is caught.

 Humans with echolocation abilities detect objects in their environment by actively creating sounds and sensing the echoes that bounce back from those objects. This is achieved through various methods such as tapping canes, lightly stomping their foot, snapping fingers, or making clicking noises with their mouths. By emitting these sounds and listening to the returning echoes, individuals trained in echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects.

Through this process, they are able to accurately identify the location and size of objects in their surroundings. The ability to perceive these echoes allows them to navigate and interact with their environment effectively.

 Some examples of animals that use their ears for echolocation are bats and certain species of dolphins. Bats have specialized ears that allow them to emit high-frequency sounds and then listen for the echoes that bounce back from objects in their environment. This helps them navigate, locate prey, and avoid obstacles while flying. Dolphins also use echolocation by emitting clicks or whistles and listening for the echoes to determine the location and distance of objects in the water. They rely on their highly developed hearing abilities, including their ears, to interpret these echoes and navigate their surroundings effectively.

 One common misconception about ear ossicles is that they have highly developed muscles, similar to bats for echolocation. However, this statement is not true. Ear ossicles are a group of three small bones located in the middle ear, namely the malleus, incus, and stapes. These bones play a crucial role in transmitting sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.

While the ossicles do possess tiny muscles, it is important to note that their role is limited to dampening excessive vibrations. These muscles include the tensor tympani, which is attached to the malleus, and the stapedius, which is connected to the stapes. Their primary function is to protect the delicate structures of the inner ear by reducing the transmission of loud sounds. However, these muscles are not highly developed like those used by bats for echolocation.

Echolocation is a unique ability found in certain animals where they emit sound waves and interpret the echoes bouncing back to navigate and locate objects in their environment. Bats, for example, use echolocation to navigate and hunt for prey. The muscles associated with their hearing apparatus are highly specialized to produce and interpret these high-frequency sounds.

In contrast, the muscles associated with the ear ossicles in humans are not adapted for echolocation. Our hearing system is designed to process a wide range of sounds but does not possess the capabilities for echolocation like bats or other animals do. Instead, the ear ossicles, together with the cochlea in the inner ear, play a vital role in converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

Therefore, it is not true that the muscles of the ear ossicles are highly developed like those found in bats or other animals that utilize echolocation.

  of the rapid flight of bats and the short range at which prey can be detected using echolocation, allowing bats only a fraction of a second after detection to capture prey. However, gray bats are believed to discriminate somewhat between insects when foraging in their natural habitat, consuming higher numbers of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and in some populations Trichoptera, than their proportional prevalence would have otherwise indicated without selective foraging. Because of this tendency to select prey while being largely opportunistic, gray bats have been dubbed ‘selective opportunists’. Scientists believe that food moves quickly through the digestive tract of M. grisescens, with feces being purged from the body within 1–2 hours after ingestion.

  Egyptian slit-faced bats form roosting colonies numbering from a few to thousands of other members. Because they can maneuver in crowded habitats, they are able to occupy caves and holes that cannot be accessed by other bat species. While the bats do form a communal roost, individuals do not huddle together to conserve energy and warmth. They occupy two roosts, using the daytime roost to rest, while only spending a few hours in the night roost before going out to forage. They have a long-night foraging period, lasting several hours. The bats use high-frequency and low-intensity echolocation calls to locate prey. The low wing loading and low aspect ratio allows them to hover and

  The bat calling sound is a long and slowly repeating signal. If males hear the call of an approaching bat or a similar sound, they will stop their mate calling. The males will remain silent for several milliseconds to more than a minute. More sexually attractive males, those with higher single pulse pair rates and amplitudes, experience a higher risk of predation because they resume mate calling sooner than less attractive males. This may occur because the attractive males are better equipped to escape from bats, thus decreasing the apparently high risk. Another theory is that risk taking could be a sexually selected trait. Females can decipher between the moth calling and the bat calling sound. During mate calling, females fan their wings. However, when they hear the bat's sound, they stop fanning their wings. In order to avoid being captured by bats, the moths fly erratically, fall to the ground, or fly away from the source of the sound.

  Active Bat is a low-power, wireless indoor location system accurate up to 3 cm. It is based on a principle of trilateration, and relies on multiple ultrasonic receivers embedded in the ceiling and measures time-of-flight to them. Active Bat is an indoor localization system which gives an accuracy within centimeters. This is a range based technique, which works by finding the distance to minimum of three reference nodes and then using multilateration technique to find the exact position. The distance to reference nodes is find out using the time of arrival of ultrasonic signals from the reference nodes.

  Bats have evolved very sensitive hearing to cope with their nocturnal activity. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1 kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200 kHz. Bats that can detect 200 kHz cannot hear very well below 10 kHz. In any case, the most sensitive range of bat hearing is narrower: about 15 kHz to 90 kHz. Bats navigate around objects and locate their prey using echolocation. A bat will produce a very loud, short sound and assess the echo when it bounces back.

Instead, the ear ossicles, together with the cochlea in the inner ear, play a vital role in converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

Therefore, it is not true that the muscles of the ear ossicles are highly developed like those found in bats or other animals that utilize echolocation.

['When it comes to dissolving solids, the best beverage to use is a glass of ice-cold water. This is because water has a high surface area to volume ratio, which allows it to dissolve solids more easily than other liquids. Additionally, water has a low viscosity, meaning that it flows easily and can penetrate small spaces, making it ideal for dissolving solids that are trapped in crevices or other hard-to-reach areas.\n\nIn contrast, a boiling hot mug of tea or a cup of warm milk may not be the best choice for dissolving solids. This is because the high temperature can actually make it more difficult for solids to dissolve. When water is heated, it becomes less able to dissolve solids due to the increased viscosity and decreased surface area to volume ratio.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of other substances in tea or milk can also affect the ability of water to dissolve solids. For example, the tannins in tea can actually prevent the dissolution of certain solids, while the fat in milk can make it more difficult for water to dissolve soluble solids.\n\nIn summary, while all of these beverages can be used to dissolve solids, a glass of ice-cold water is the best choice due to its high surface area to volume ratio and low viscosity.', 'Which beverage would dissolve solids the best?Which beverage would dissolve solids the best?\nA.

Unfortunately, the simplified ASA-based model cannot capture the "specific" distance-dependent interactions between different types of atoms in the solid state which are responsible for clustering of atoms with similar polarities in protein structures and molecular crystals. Parameters of such interatomic interactions, together with atomic solvation parameters for the protein interior, have been approximately derived from protein engineering data. The implicit solvation model breaks down when solvent molecules associate strongly with binding cavities in a protein, so that the protein and the solvent molecules form a continuous solid body. On the other hand, this model can be successfully applied for describing transfer from water to the fluid lipid bilayer.

 Protein digestion rate in human stomach.
Most members in our G4 group want to become doctor so our topic focuses mainly on medicine and healthcare.
I spent my summer vacation in China this year. My grandfather suffered from diabetes and his doctor told him not to eat too much because that would increase his blood sugar. He had poor diet for years which caused him anemia (condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin). This disease can be caused by poor diet and anorexia nervosa which is an illness of eating disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. I suggested him to take protein powder I brought form U.S. As a bodybuilder, I knew that protein can make people healthier by putting on more muscle. But it’s not all what a responsible physician needs to know! Instead, a doctor should be able to suggest patient to use different types of proteins at different time because of the different digestion rate of protein. Another reason is a good diet cannot be replaced by protein powder. That’s the reason we chose our G4 topic and we would like to apply our result to healthcare fields in the future.
Is the protein digestion rate of different solid proteins different in human stomach and what factors can contribute to the difference between them? Based on the theory behind the prediction, what type of solid protein will have the fastest and the lowest protein digestion rate?
The protein digestion rate of different types of solid proteins will be different. The type of solid protein with the highest protein to fat concentration ratio will have the highest digestion rate as it takes more energy to break down lipids as one gram lipids gives off 9 calories compared to 4 calories from protein. Lipid is hydrophobic macromolecule which means it will water in the stomach thus decrease the digestion rate. Also the enzyme we will use to observe the digestion rate is pepsin, which is a polar substance. Another factor which will influence the protein digestion rate is the water concentration: solid protein with the highest water concentration will have the highest protein digestion rate as it allows the food to interact with water and polar pepsin in stomach more vigorously. Based on those factors and research about the macromolecule content in solid proteins which will be tested, I predict that boiled egg will have the highest protein digestion rate and mixed nuts will have the lowest protein digestion rate.
Stomach is part of the human digestive system. It has a saclike shape and is located between the esophagus and the intestines. The stomach is about 30.5 cm long and 15.2 cm wide. The capacity is about 0.94 liters in an adult. Food enters stomach and the gastric juices break down the food. Some substances are absorbed before entering the intestines.
Gastric acid is hydrochloric acid secreted by the stomach. The highly acidic environment in stomach (pH of 2) enables stomach to kill bacteria before food entering intestines. However, it causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure. They denature. The stomach also secrets pepsin, an enzyme breaks down peptide bonds between amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. Thus the protein digestion mainly happens in human stomach.
The temperature of human stomach corresponds to human body’s temperature: around 37 Celsius degrees.
The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme’s substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product of the reaction.
The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region is called active site.
Pepsin has broad specificity with a preference for peptides containing linkages with aromatic or dicarboxylic L-amino acids. It preferencially cleaves C-terminal to Phe and Leu and to a lesser extent Glu linkages. The enzyme does not cleave at Val, Ala, or Gly.
We chose pepsin as the enzyme because this is the enzyme in human stomach and we believe it will work on most foods we test (substances).
A hydrophobic molecule is repelled by water. They often cluster together when dropped in water, just as oil does. Hydrophobic molecules are also called lipophilic because they will dissolve in oils and other lipids. They tend to be electrically neutral and nonpolar and work better with neutral and nonpolar solvents.
Hydrophobic molecules include alkanes, oils, fats and other greasy substances.
Hydrophilic is typically used to describe a property of a molecule and refers to the likelihood of its bonding with the hydrogen molecule in water. A hydrophilic molecule is not just soluble in water but also in other polar solvents. It will dissolve less readily in oils and other hydrophobic solvents.
– Temperature: to keep the temperature in beakers as constant as possible (37.0 oC), I used hot water bath method. I put 5 beakers into a big cooking pot filled with 4 liters of water. By heating the water in cooking pot to 37.0oC first, the solution in the beakers will keep the temperature rather constant because it takes longer time for larger amount of liquid to cool down. The temperature in the beaker is measured every 15 minutes from the beginning till the end of the experiment to keep constant.
– pH value of the beaker: to mimic the human stomach, the HCl concentration in the beaker corresponds to the HCl concentration in human stomach: 0.10 moles/liter. So I added 20.0 ml of 1.00 M HCl to every 180 ml of water to make 0.10 M HCl solution.
– Pepsin: in every beaker we put 162 mg of pepsin (1 pepsin capsule) and stirred it till all the powder completely dissolved in the HCl solution.
– Solid protein: 10.0 grams of each type of solid protein is measured and to be tested.
2) Put 180 ml of tap water into each of 500 ml beakers.
3) Put 20.0 ml of 1.00M HCl into each beaker (5 in total).
4) Labe the beakers with number 1 to 5.
6) Put the chicken breast into beaker #1, tofu into beaker #2, cheese into beaker #3, nuts into beaker #4 and egg white into beaker #5.
7) Put 4 liters into the cooking pot and start heating it until it reaches 37.0 oC.
8) Put all 5 beakers into the cooking pot and using thermometer check the temperature of the beakers every 15 minutes till the end of the experiment (7 times).
9) Measure the weight of the solid proteins in each beaker every 30 minutes for 4 times in total. Use chopsticks to transfer the food.
The chart below shows the measurement of the temperature in Celsius degrees of the beaker #1 as sample every 15 minutes.
The chart below shows the weight of the solid protein in each beaker measured every 30 minutes.
The negative number indicates the increase in weight of the solid protein due to the water absorption. This is caused by diffusion of water from higher concentration (HCl solution) to lower concentration (food).
From the graph we can observe that in the first half hour, cheese will have the highest protein digestion rate and nuts will have the lowest protein digestion rate. In the second half hour, the protein digestion rate of egg white and cheese will be stopped. Chicken breast will have the highest protein digestion rate and nuts will still have the lowest protein digestion rate.
The data supports part of my hypothesis. Different types of solid proteins have different digestion rates. The mixed nuts had the slowest digestion rate because nuts had the lowest protein to fat concentration ratio (0.336 : 1) and lowest water concentration (1.75%).
My hypothesis about egg white having the highest protein digestion rate because egg white has the highest protein to fat concentration (egg white is fat free) and highest water concentration (87.%) is not supported by the data. This is caused by the 54.0% of ovalbumin and 11.0% of ovomucoid in the egg white. Ovalbumin and ovomucoid are nourishments in egg white which are protease (digestive enzyme) blocking proteins. Although pepsin has broad specificity, in this case its activity is blocked by ovomucoid and ovalbumin.
Overall, boiled chicken breast has the rather constant and high protein digestion rate throughout the experiment. This supports the theories behind my hypothesis. Other than boiled egg white, chicken breast has the highest protein to fat concentration ratio (43.1: 1) and the highest water concentration (76.7%).
The solid proteins being tested can be put into two categories: egg white and cheese are the fast digesting proteins and nuts, chicken breast and tofu are the slow digesting proteins which the process last longer in human stomach.
Although the data supported our hypothesis, human errors, random errors and two important systematic errors occurred during the experiment.
First, only small amount of pepsin was mixed with the HCl solution thus it is important not to lose any of the chemical. We used the diameter of 0.5 cm chopstick to stir the solution to help the pepsin to dissolve faster but some of the pepsin powder was stick on the chopstick when we pulled it out. The surface area of chopstick which touched the water was around 7.85 cm2 +/-0.005cm (r = 0.50 cm and h = 10.0 cm, h) and some pepsin powder was stick on this surface area. This also caused unequal amount of pepsin in different beakers and since the amount of pepsin in each beaker is a constant variable, this error affected the result.
From 4:27 p.m. to 4:57 p.m., the temperature of the beaker wasn’t kept exactly around 37.0 oC. The temperature dropped to 36.2oC which also affected the result in that period since the enzyme couldn’t work efficiently in 36.2 oC environment. This can be considered as both human and random error. The researcher was unable to keep the temperature constant due to lack of proper equipment but the time when the experiment was carried out (12/5/2009, 4:00p.m. – 6:00p.m.) the weather was cold and rainy and it caused the water in the cooking pot to cool down faster than the researcher expected.
The number in the second chart on raw data does not match the number on the chart in the processed data section because the researcher made a human error by ignoring the significant figures.
During the experiment, the researcher failed to measure the temperature of every beaker in the cooking pot. Instead, we took one beaker as a sample (beaker #1) and assumed that the temperature of other beakers would be the same. It was a wrong assumption because we failed to check whether the cooking pot was placed in the center above the stove and whether the fire came from the stove equally. It might cause that part of the water in the cooking pot has higher or lower temperature than other part. Although the temperature of the liquid in the cooking pot will be the same after a while, the smallest difference in temperature could affect the enzyme activity which could cause a systematic error in the result.
At the beginning of the experiment planning, instead of measuring the solid proteins of the same weight, I wanted to use samples of the same size (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) but soon I realized that same size samples would have different weight (eg. same size cheese is heavier than egg white). But it is a controversial issue because the amount of surface area touching the enzyme is an important factor which decides the protein digestion rate. 10.0 g of cheese is much smaller than 10.0g of egg white thus have much smaller surface area and enzyme will work better with egg white than with cheese because egg white and pepsin will have more contact area. I failed to take this factor into consideration and it caused another systematic error in the result.
Although the data supported our hypothesis, we cannot say that the data is valid due to the errors we made during the experiment.
Many errors in our investigation were due to lack of equipment. The realistic suggestion of correction the error is to use hot plate to stir the solution instead of using chopstick. The hot plate does not touch the solution direction thus would not carry any chemical with it. The hot plate can also warm up the solution which can be more accurate than using stove. The temperature can also be more easily controlled by using the hot plate because it is easy to overheat the solution using the stove.
Regarding the surface vs. weight issue, it would be better to use the samples of the same surface area and record the weight of each one. Although the samples would have different weights, researcher can use formula to calculate the protein digestion rate for each sample without leaving any factor into consideration.

 Groundwater plays a significant role in supplying mineral nutrients to inhabitants living in Asian deltas. In these areas, more than 70% of people rely on groundwater as their source of drinking water. While nutrients are typically obtained through food, in underdeveloped rural settings where individuals have low-nutrient diets, drinking water can be an important source of essential minerals.

Research conducted on three Asian deltas (Bengal, Mekong, and Red River) has shown that the chemical content of groundwater in these regions is substantial. In some areas, individuals can obtain up to 50% or more of their recommended daily intake (RDI) of certain nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, from just two liters of drinking water.

The presence of dissolved solids in water sources, including groundwater, can have implications for human health. Poor nutrition and non-communicable diseases may be associated with high levels of dissolved solids in drinking water. Understanding the contribution of drinking water to nutrient and mineral supply is therefore important in assessing the association between these health outcomes and poor nutrition in areas with high levels of dissolved solids in water sources.

In summary, the significance of groundwater in supplying mineral nutrients to inhabitants living in Asian deltas lies in its potential to provide critical nutrients, especially in areas with limited access to nutrient-rich foods. It is crucial to consider the contribution of drinking water to nutrient and mineral supply when assessing the association between non-communicable diseases, poor nutrition, and high levels of dissolved solids in water sources.

  it's physically deformed. The plastic straining generates new dislocations. As the dislocation density increases, further dislocation movement becomes more difficult since they hinder each other, which means the material hardness increases. ; In solid solution strengthening, a soluble alloying element is added to the material desired to be strengthened, and together they form a “solid solution”. A solid solution can be thought of just as a "normal" liquid solution, e.g. salt in water, except it is solid. Depending on the size of the dissolved alloying element's ion compared to that of the matrix-metal, it is dissolved either substitutionally (large alloying element substituting for an atom in the crystal) or

Is the protein digestion rate of different solid proteins different in human stomach and what factors can contribute to the difference between them? Based on the theory behind the prediction, what type of solid protein will have the fastest and the lowest protein digestion rate?
The protein digestion rate of different types of solid proteins will be different. The type of solid protein with the highest protein to fat concentration ratio will have the highest digestion rate as it takes more energy to break down lipids as one gram lipids gives off 9 calories compared to 4 calories from protein. Lipid is hydrophobic macromolecule which means it will water in the stomach thus decrease the digestion rate. Also the enzyme we will use to observe the digestion rate is pepsin, which is a polar substance. Another factor which will influence the protein digestion rate is the water concentration: solid protein with the highest water concentration will have the highest protein digestion rate as it allows the food to interact with water and polar pepsin in stomach more vigorously. Based on those factors and research about the macromolecule content in solid proteins which will be tested, I predict that boiled egg will have the highest protein digestion rate and mixed nuts will have the lowest protein digestion rate.
Stomach is part of the human digestive system. It has a saclike shape and is located between the esophagus and the intestines. The stomach is about 30.5 cm long and 15.2 cm wide. The capacity is about 0.94 liters in an adult. Food enters stomach and the gastric juices break down the food. Some substances are absorbed before entering the intestines.
Gastric acid is hydrochloric acid secreted by the stomach. The highly acidic environment in stomach (pH of 2) enables stomach to kill bacteria before food entering intestines. However, it causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure. They denature. The stomach also secrets pepsin, an enzyme breaks down peptide bonds between amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. Thus the protein digestion mainly happens in human stomach.
The temperature of human stomach corresponds to human body’s temperature: around 37 Celsius degrees.
The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme’s substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product of the reaction.
The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region is called active site.
Pepsin has broad specificity with a preference for peptides containing linkages with aromatic or dicarboxylic L-amino acids. It preferencially cleaves C-terminal to Phe and Leu and to a lesser extent Glu linkages. The enzyme does not cleave at Val, Ala, or Gly.
We chose pepsin as the enzyme because this is the enzyme in human stomach and we believe it will work on most foods we test (substances).
A hydrophobic molecule is repelled by water. They often cluster together when dropped in water, just as oil does. Hydrophobic molecules are also called lipophilic because they will dissolve in oils and other lipids. They tend to be electrically neutral and nonpolar and work better with neutral and nonpolar solvents.
Hydrophobic molecules include alkanes, oils, fats and other greasy substances.
Hydrophilic is typically used to describe a property of a molecule and refers to the likelihood of its bonding with the hydrogen molecule in water. A hydrophilic molecule is not just soluble in water but also in other polar solvents. It will dissolve less readily in oils and other hydrophobic solvents.
– Temperature: to keep the temperature in beakers as constant as possible (37.0 oC), I used hot water bath method. I put 5 beakers into a big cooking pot filled with 4 liters of water. By heating the water in cooking pot to 37.0oC first, the solution in the beakers will keep the temperature rather constant because it takes longer time for larger amount of liquid to cool down. The temperature in the beaker is measured every 15 minutes from the beginning till the end of the experiment to keep constant.
– pH value of the beaker: to mimic the human stomach, the HCl concentration in the beaker corresponds to the HCl concentration in human stomach: 0.10 moles/liter. So I added 20.0 ml of 1.00 M HCl to every 180 ml of water to make 0.10 M HCl solution.
– Pepsin: in every beaker we put 162 mg of pepsin (1 pepsin capsule) and stirred it till all the powder completely dissolved in the HCl solution.
– Solid protein: 10.0 grams of each type of solid protein is measured and to be tested.
2) Put 180 ml of tap water into each of 500 ml beakers.
3) Put 20.0 ml of 1.00M HCl into each beaker (5 in total).
4) Labe the beakers with number 1 to 5.
6) Put the chicken breast into beaker #1, tofu into beaker #2, cheese into beaker #3, nuts into beaker #4 and egg white into beaker #5.
7) Put 4 liters into the cooking pot and start heating it until it reaches 37.0 oC.
8) Put all 5 beakers into the cooking pot and using thermometer check the temperature of the beakers every 15 minutes till the end of the experiment (7 times).
9) Measure the weight of the solid proteins in each beaker every 30 minutes for 4 times in total. Use chopsticks to transfer the food.
The chart below shows the measurement of the temperature in Celsius degrees of the beaker #1 as sample every 15 minutes.
The chart below shows the weight of the solid protein in each beaker measured every 30 minutes.
The negative number indicates the increase in weight of the solid protein due to the water absorption. This is caused by diffusion of water from higher concentration (HCl solution) to lower concentration (food).
From the graph we can observe that in the first half hour, cheese will have the highest protein digestion rate and nuts will have the lowest protein digestion rate. In the second half hour, the protein digestion rate of egg white and cheese will be stopped. Chicken breast will have the highest protein digestion rate and nuts will still have the lowest protein digestion rate.
The data supports part of my hypothesis. Different types of solid proteins have different digestion rates. The mixed nuts had the slowest digestion rate because nuts had the lowest protein to fat concentration ratio (0.336 : 1) and lowest water concentration (1.75%).
My hypothesis about egg white having the highest protein digestion rate because egg white has the highest protein to fat concentration (egg white is fat free) and highest water concentration (87.%) is not supported by the data. This is caused by the 54.0% of ovalbumin and 11.0% of ovomucoid in the egg white. Ovalbumin and ovomucoid are nourishments in egg white which are protease (digestive enzyme) blocking proteins. Although pepsin has broad specificity, in this case its activity is blocked by ovomucoid and ovalbumin.
Overall, boiled chicken breast has the rather constant and high protein digestion rate throughout the experiment. This supports the theories behind my hypothesis. Other than boiled egg white, chicken breast has the highest protein to fat concentration ratio (43.1: 1) and the highest water concentration (76.7%).
The solid proteins being tested can be put into two categories: egg white and cheese are the fast digesting proteins and nuts, chicken breast and tofu are the slow digesting proteins which the process last longer in human stomach.
Although the data supported our hypothesis, human errors, random errors and two important systematic errors occurred during the experiment.
First, only small amount of pepsin was mixed with the HCl solution thus it is important not to lose any of the chemical. We used the diameter of 0.5 cm chopstick to stir the solution to help the pepsin to dissolve faster but some of the pepsin powder was stick on the chopstick when we pulled it out. The surface area of chopstick which touched the water was around 7.85 cm2 +/-0.005cm (r = 0.50 cm and h = 10.0 cm, h) and some pepsin powder was stick on this surface area. This also caused unequal amount of pepsin in different beakers and since the amount of pepsin in each beaker is a constant variable, this error affected the result.
From 4:27 p.m. to 4:57 p.m., the temperature of the beaker wasn’t kept exactly around 37.0 oC. The temperature dropped to 36.2oC which also affected the result in that period since the enzyme couldn’t work efficiently in 36.2 oC environment. This can be considered as both human and random error. The researcher was unable to keep the temperature constant due to lack of proper equipment but the time when the experiment was carried out (12/5/2009, 4:00p.m. – 6:00p.m.) the weather was cold and rainy and it caused the water in the cooking pot to cool down faster than the researcher expected.
The number in the second chart on raw data does not match the number on the chart in the processed data section because the researcher made a human error by ignoring the significant figures.
During the experiment, the researcher failed to measure the temperature of every beaker in the cooking pot. Instead, we took one beaker as a sample (beaker #1) and assumed that the temperature of other beakers would be the same. It was a wrong assumption because we failed to check whether the cooking pot was placed in the center above the stove and whether the fire came from the stove equally. It might cause that part of the water in the cooking pot has higher or lower temperature than other part. Although the temperature of the liquid in the cooking pot will be the same after a while, the smallest difference in temperature could affect the enzyme activity which could cause a systematic error in the result.
At the beginning of the experiment planning, instead of measuring the solid proteins of the same weight, I wanted to use samples of the same size (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) but soon I realized that same size samples would have different weight (eg. same size cheese is heavier than egg white). But it is a controversial issue because the amount of surface area touching the enzyme is an important factor which decides the protein digestion rate. 10.0 g of cheese is much smaller than 10.0g of egg white thus have much smaller surface area and enzyme will work better with egg white than with cheese because egg white and pepsin will have more contact area. I failed to take this factor into consideration and it caused another systematic error in the result.
Although the data supported our hypothesis, we cannot say that the data is valid due to the errors we made during the experiment.
Many errors in our investigation were due to lack of equipment. The realistic suggestion of correction the error is to use hot plate to stir the solution instead of using chopstick. The hot plate does not touch the solution direction thus would not carry any chemical with it. The hot plate can also warm up the solution which can be more accurate than using stove. The temperature can also be more easily controlled by using the hot plate because it is easy to overheat the solution using the stove.
Regarding the surface vs. weight issue, it would be better to use the samples of the same surface area and record the weight of each one. Although the samples would have different weights, researcher can use formula to calculate the protein digestion rate for each sample without leaving any factor into consideration.

["Pasteurization, a process that kills bacteria in food and drink, was invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur in the 1860s. The technique was initially used to prevent spoilage in beer and wine, but it was later applied to milk and other dairy products. Pasteurization is now a standard practice in the food industry, and it has significantly reduced the incidence of foodborne illnesses.\n\n\nHowever, there is a common misconception that Thomas Edison, the famous American inventor, was the one who invented pasteurization. This is not true. While Edison did make significant contributions to the field of electrical engineering, he did not invent pasteurization.\n\n\nIn fact, Edison's interest in pasteurization was primarily focused on its potential to improve the quality of milk. In the late 1800s, milk was a common source of foodborne illnesses, and Edison believed that pasteurization could help to eliminate these risks. He worked with dairy farmers to develop a pasteurization machine that could be used on a large scale, and he even patented a design for a pasteurization plant.\n\n\nHowever, Edison's efforts to promote pasteurization were not entirely successful.

The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage. After sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s.

  and brucellosis (all thought to be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk). In the early days after the scientific discovery of bacteria, there was no product testing to determine whether a farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk was treated as potentially contagious. After the first tests were developed, some farmers took steps to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, sometimes even falsifying test results to make their animals appear free of infection. Recent advances in the analysis of milk-borne diseases have enabled scientists to track the DNA of the

 Whether it’s from cows, goats, sheep or another mammal, milk and milk products are an important source of calcium throughout a person’s life.Most of the milk sold in the United States is pasteurized, a process during which the milk is heated to 161 degrees and kept there for 15 seconds. Pasteurization kills harmful bacteria — including salmonella, E. coli, and listeria — that can contaminate milk before it gets to your table. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend pasteurization for all milk consumed by people in the United States.
Pasteurization of milk is an effective means of preventing outbreaks of foodborne illness, including tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, scarlet fever and listeriosis. It was first used in the United States more than 100 years ago and has been widely used for more than a half-century, says John Sheehan, an FDA expert on the safety of dairy products.
Increasingly, consumers are seeing “raw” milk — and cheeses, yogurts, and other products made from it — in specialty shops, farmers’ markets and stores. That’s partly because many Americans have developed a “back to nature” philosophy about the foods they eat, embracing the idea that locally produced and minimally processed foods are more nutritious.
But in the case of raw milk, FDA says that’s not true. Although the heating process slightly affects a few of the vitamins, the changes are not significant. Meanwhile, there is a risk that milk could be contaminated by environmental factors such as soil or animal feces, animal diseases, or bacteria on an animal’s skin.
In countries where pasteurization of milk is less common, outbreaks of foodborne illness attributed to tainted milk or milk products occur more frequently than they do in the United States. In France, for example, the rate of foodborne illness attributed to milk and milk products was reported to be roughly three times what it is in the U.S., says Sheehan, citing a 2001 study by researcher Marie-Laure De Buyser and other French scientists.
To avoid raw milk, read the label on milk or milk products before you buy them. Many companies put the word “pasteurized” right on the label, but it is not required. Or, ask the person selling the product if the milk has been pasteurized.
Not all raw milk and products made from it contain harmful bacteria. But if they do, the bacteria could be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. While most healthy people recover from a food borne illness in a short time, some people may develop symptoms that are chronic, severe, or even life-threatening.
Symptoms of foodborne illness may include: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache and body aches.
If you think you might have become ill from drinking raw milk — or eating yogurt, cheese, or a product made from it — see your health care provider immediately.

  Humans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 9000–7000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000 BC in the Americas. The most important dairy animals—cattle, sheep and goats—were first domesticated in Mesopotamia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. From there dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but not reaching Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC). Pasteurization

  bacteria to the cows on the farms that supplied the raw milk. The recognition of many potentially deadly pathogens, such as E. coli 0157 H7, Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella, and their possible presence in poorly produced milk products has led to the continuation of pasteurization. The Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies of the United States strongly recommend that the public do not consume raw milk or raw milk products. Young children, the elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are more susceptible to infections originating in raw milk.

 Pasteurization is a process commonly used in food and beverage industries to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It involves heating the product to a specific temperature for a certain period of time to eliminate or reduce the microbial population. Although pasteurization is primarily used for food preservation, it does have some disinfectant properties.

During pasteurization, heat is applied to the product, typically at temperatures ranging from 60 to 85 degrees Celsius (140 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit), for a specific period of time. This thermal treatment effectively destroys many pathogenic microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses. In some cases, pasteurization can also eliminate spoilage organisms, helping to extend the product's shelf life.

While pasteurization is not a sterilization method, it effectively reduces the microbial load and thus makes the product safer for consumption. It is most commonly associated with the treatment of dairy products, such as milk and cheese, but is also used for juices, beer, and other beverages. By subjecting these products to heat treatment, pasteurization helps to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination and ensure consumer safety.

It's important to note that pasteurization is not a substitute for thorough sanitation practices and proper hygiene. It is typically used in conjunction with other disinfection methods, such as cleaning and sanitizing surfaces, equipment, and utensils involved in food production and processing.

In conclusion, pasteurization is a heat treatment process used primarily for food preservation. While it is not a sterilization method, it effectively reduces the microbial population in the product, making it safer for consumption. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and quality of various food and beverage products. The answer is A.

They state that pasteurization destroys or damages some of the milk's nutrients, and that while pasteurization may kill dangerous bacteria, it also kills off good bacteria that raw milk supporters have stated to have health benefits. The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that this is false, and that pasteurizing milk does not destroy any of its nutritive value. Proponents also invoke the benefits of direct-marketing when promoting the sale of raw milk. The ability of the

  The most commonly applied technique to provide a safe and shelf-stable milk is heat treatment. The first system involving indirect heating with continuous flow (125 C for 6 min) was manufactured in 1893. In 1912, a continuous-flow, direct-heating method of mixing steam with milk at temperatures of 130 to 140 C was patented. However, without commercially available aseptic packaging systems to pack and store the product, such technology was not very useful in itself, and further development was stalled until the 1950s. In 1953, APV pioneered a steam injection technology, involving direct injection of steam through a specially designed nozzle which raises the product temperature instantly, under brand name Uperiser; milk was packaged

['The solid phase of matter has a concrete configuration. This means that the particles in a solid are arranged in a fixed and definite pattern. The particles are held in place by strong intermolecular forces, such as covalent bonds, ionic bonds, and metallic bonds. This results in a rigid and stable structure that maintains its shape and volume. The concrete configuration of solids allows them to have unique properties, such as strength, hardness, and durability.\n\nFor example, a brick is a solid object made of clay, sand, and water. The particles in the clay and sand are arranged in a specific pattern, which gives the brick its shape and strength. The intermolecular forces between the particles hold them together, preventing the brick from falling apart. This concrete configuration allows the brick to be used as a building material, as it can withstand the weight and pressure of a structure.\n\nIn contrast, the solid phase of matter can also have an ambiguous form. This occurs when the particles in a solid are arranged in a disordered or irregular pattern. This can happen due to factors such as temperature, pressure, or chemical composition. For example, a glass of water can have an ambiguous form if it is heated to a high temperature. The water molecules become disordered and lose their shape, resulting in a liquid state.\n\nHowever, if the water is cooled to a low temperature, it will solidify', 'In solid phase matter has a/anIn solid phase matter has a/an\nA. concrete configuration\nB. ambiguous form\nC. shapeless form\nD. radioactive glow']

  The use of blockwork allows structures to be built in the traditional masonry style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks. Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce weight, improve insulation and provide an interconnected void into which concrete can be poured to solidify the entire wall after it is built. Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as "4-inch", "6-inch", "8-inch", and "12-inch". In the US, CMU blocks are nominally 16 in long and 8 in wide. Their actual dimensions are 3/8 in less than the nominal dimensions (to allow for 3⁄8-inch mortar joints between blocks in

  Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone. At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose–Einstein condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale. This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single super atom, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.

  for the growth of the particles which will induce the growth of the pore as the high coordination number prohibits the growth towards the pore. For many materials, it can be seen from their phase diagram that multiple phases can exist at the same time. Those different phases might exhibit different crystal structure, thus exhibiting different mechanical properties. Furthermore, these different phases also exhibit a different microstructure (grain size, orientation). This can also improve some mechanical properties as crack deflection can occur, thus pushing the ultimate breakdown further as it creates a more tortuous crack path in the coarser microstructure.

  inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.

  Concrete blocks are made from cast concrete (e.g. Portland cement and aggregate, usually sand and fine gravel, for high-density blocks). Lower density blocks may use industrial wastes, such as fly ash or bottom ash, as an aggregate. Recycled materials, such as post-consumer glass, slag cement, or recycled aggregate, are often used in the composition of the blocks. Use of recycled materials within blocks can create different appearances in the block, such as a terrazzo finish, and may help the finished structure earn LEED certification. Lightweight blocks can also be produced using autoclaved aerated concrete; these are widely used for construction in Finland and similar northern countries for the material's inherent thermal isolation characteristics, as are expanded clay aggregate blocks.

  Ceramics are made from clay and hardened by heat. Ceramics can also be coated with a protective coating to ensure impermeability. Clay is formed by the alteration of feldspathic rocks under the influence of atmospheric agents, such as rain, rivers, winds and gas releases from the Earth's crust. There are three types of rock differentiated by physical characteristics resulting from their respective formative processes. These three categories are: igneous or volcanic rocks (basalt, granite, etc.), sedimentary or deposit rocks (limestone, sandstone, arenite, etc.), and metamorphic rocks (marble, slate, gypsum, etc.). Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and/or solidification of magma and the formation of a dense network of crystals—below the Earth's surface as intrusive rock or on the surface as effusive rock. Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of the remains of other rock caused by the action of atmospheric influences. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the transformation of existing rock through the action of temperature and pressure, which cause profound physical and/or chemical changes.

 Liquid is one of the four fundamental states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma. It is characterized by its ability to flow and take on the shape of its container. Unlike solids, which have a fixed shape and volume, liquids do not have a definite shape but rather conform to the shape of their container. However, they do have a definite volume.

One key characteristic of liquids is their ability to form a distinct surface at the boundaries of their bulk material. This surface is known as a free surface and is where the liquid is not constrained by a container. The presence of this free surface allows liquids to exhibit properties such as capillary action and surface tension.

In terms of particle arrangement, liquids have particles that are close together but still able to move past one another. This enables them to flow easily compared to solids, where particles are tightly packed and held in fixed positions.

The behavior of liquids also differs from gases. While both can flow and take on the shape of their containers, gases expand more readily than liquids when heated due to the greater kinetic energy of gas particles. Liquids are generally denser than gases because their particles are closer together.

Overall, the characteristics that distinguish liquids from other states of matter include their ability to flow, take on the shape of their container while maintaining a distinct volume, form a free surface at boundaries, and exhibit intermediate particle arrangement between solids and gases.

 Water is an essential component in the hardening process of various materials. In the context of construction, water plays a crucial role in the hardening process of materials like cement. When cement is mixed with water, a chemical reaction called hydration occurs, leading to the formation of a strong and durable material known as concrete. Water acts as a crucial medium that facilitates the hydration process and allows the cement particles to react and bind together, resulting in a hard and solid structure.

Additionally, water is also used in the hardening process of various metals. In metallurgy, water is often utilized during the quenching process, which involves rapid cooling of heated metals. When a hot metal object is immersed in water, the rapid cooling helps in achieving their desired hardness and strength. Water acts as a means to transfer heat away from the metal, promoting the formation of a specific microstructure that contributes to the desired hardening properties.

Furthermore, water is utilized in the hardening process of certain organic materials, such as dental or orthopedic casts. These casts often contain materials like plaster of Paris, which harden when water is applied. The water triggers a chemical reaction that causes the plaster particles to undergo hydration, resulting in the creation of a rigid and solid structure.

In summary, water is used in the hardening process of various materials such as cement, metals, and organic compounds. Its role varies depending on the specific material, but generally, water acts as a medium for facilitating chemical reactions or as a means to regulate the temperature during the hardening process.

 Mucoadhesion describes the attractive forces between a biological material and mucus or mucous membrane. Mucous membranes adhere to epithelial surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract), the vagina, the lung, the eye, etc. They are generally hydrophilic as they contain many hydrogen macromolecules due to the large amount of water (approximately 95%) within its composition. However, mucin also contains glycoproteins that enable the formation of a gel-like substance. Understanding the hydrophilic bonding and adhesion mechanisms of mucus to biological material is of utmost importance in order to produce the most efficient applications. For example, in drug delivery systems, the mucus layer must be penetrated in order to effectively transport micro- or nanosized drug particles into the body. Bioadhesion is the mechanism by which two biological materials are held together by interfacial forces.

Mucoadhesive bondings 
Mucoadhesion involves several types of bonding mechanisms, and it is the interaction between each process that allows for the adhesive process. The major categories are wetting theory, adsorption theory, diffusion theory, electrostatic theory, and fracture theory. Specific processes include mechanical interlocking, electrostatic, diffusion interpenetration, adsorption and fracture processes.

Bonding mechanisms 
Wetting theory: Wetting is the oldest and most prevalent theory of adhesion. The adhesive components in a liquid solution anchor themselves in irregularities on the substrate and eventually harden, providing sites on which to adhere. Surface tension effects restrict the movement of the adhesive along the surface of the substrate, and is related to the thermodynamic work of adhesion by Dupre's Equation. Measuring the affinity of the adhesive for the substrate is performed by determining the contact angle. Contact angles closer to zero indicate a more wettable interaction, and those interactions have a greater spreadability.

Adsorption theory: Adsorption is another widely accepted theory, where adhesion between the substrate and adhesive is due to primary and secondary bonding. The primary bonds are due to chemisorption, and result in comparatively long lasting covalent and non-covalent bonds. Among covalent bonds disulfide bonds are likely most important. Thiolated polymers – designated thiomers – are mucoadhesive polymers that can form disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains of mucus glycoproteins. Recently several new classes of polymers have been developed that are capable of forming covalent bonds with mucosal surfaces similarly to thiomers. These polymers have acryloyl, methacryloyl, maleimide, boronate and N‐hydroxy (sulfo) succinimide ester groups in their structure. Among non-covalent bonds likely ionic interactions such as interactions of mucoadhesive chitosans with the anionically charged mucus  and Hydrogen bonding are most important. The secondary bonds include weak Van Der Waals forces, and interactions between hydrophobic substructure.

Diffusion theory: The mechanism for diffusion involves polymer and mucin chains from the adhesive penetrating the matrix of the substrate and forming a semipermanent bond. As the similarities between the adhesive and the substrate increase, so does the degree of mucoadhesion. The bond strength increases with the degree of penetration, increasing the adhesion strength. The penetration rate is determined by the diffusion coefficient, the degree of flexibility of the adsorbate chains, mobility and contact time. The diffusion mechanism itself is affected by the length of the molecular chains being implanted and cross-linking density, and is driven by a concentration gradient.

Electrostatic theory: is an electrostatic process involving the transfer of electrons across the interface between the substrate and adhesive. The net result is the formation of a double layer of charges that are attracted to each other due to balancing of the Fermi layers, and therefore cause adhesion. This theory only works given the assumption that the substrate and adhesive have different electrostatic surface characteristics.

 Fracture theory: Fracture theory is the major mechanism by which to determine the mechanical strength of a particular mucoadhesive, and describes the force necessary to separate the two materials after mucoadhesion has occurred. Ultimate tensile strength is determined by the separating force and the total surface area of the adhesion, and failure generally occurs in one of the surfaces rather than at the interface. Since the fracture theory only deals with the separation force, the diffusion and penetration of polymers is not accounted for in this mechanism.

Stages of mucoadhesive process 
The mucoadhesive process will differ greatly depending on the surface and properties of the adhesive. However, two general steps of the process have been identified: the contact stage and the consolidation stage.

Contact stage 
The contact stage is the initial wetting that occurs between the adhesive and membrane. This can occur mechanically by bringing together the two surfaces, or through the bodily systems, like when particles are deposited in the nasal cavity by inhalation. The principles of initial adsorption of small molecule adsorbates can be described by DLVO theory.

Adsorption theory 
According to DLVO theory, particles are held in suspension by a balance of attractive and repulsive forces. This theory can be applied to the adsorption of small molecules like mucoadhesive polymers, on surfaces, like mucus layers. Particles in general experience attractive van der Waals forces that promote coagulation; in the context of adsorption, the particle and mucus layers are naturally attracted. The attractive forces between particles increases with decreasing particle size due to increasing surface-area-to-volume ratio. This increases the strength of van der Waals interactions, so smaller particles should be easier to adsorb onto mucous membranes.

DLVO theory also explains some of the challenges in establishing contact between particles and mucus layers in mucoadhesion due to their repulsive forces. Surfaces will develop an electrical double layer if they are in a solution containing ions, as is the case with many bodily systems, creating electrostatic repulsive forces between the adhesive and surface. Steric effects can also hinder particle adsorption to surfaces. Entropy or disorder of a system will decrease as polymeric mucoadhesives adsorb to surfaces, which makes establishing contact between the adhesive and membrane more difficult. Adhesives with large surface groups will also experience a decrease in entropy as they approach the surface, creating repulsion.

Wettability theory 
The initial adsorption of the molecule adhesive will also depend on the wetting between the adhesive and membrane. This can be described using Young's equation:

where  is the interfacial tension between the membrane and gas or bodily environment,  is the interfacial tension between the bioadhesive and membrane,  is the interfacial tension between the bioadhesive and bodily environment, and  is the contact angle of the bioadhesive on the membrane. The ideal contact angle is 0° meaning the bioadhesive perfectly wets the membrane and good contact is achieved. The interfacial tensions can be measured using common experimental techniques such as a Wilhelmy plate or the Du Noüy ring method to predict if the adhesive will make good contact with the membrane.

Consolidation stage

Strong and prolonged adhesion 

The consolidation stage of mucoadhesion involves the establishment of adhesive interactions to reinforce strong or prolonged adhesion. When moisture is present, mucoadhesive materials become activated and the system becomes plasticized. This stimulus allows the mucoadhesive molecules to separate and break free while proceeding to link up by weak van der Waals and hydrogen bonds. Consolidation factors are essential for the surface when exposed to significant dislodging stresses. Multiple mucoadhesion theories exist that explain the consolidation stage, the main two which focus on macromolecular interpenetration and dehydration.

Macromolecular interpenetration theory 

The Macromolecular Interpenetration theory, also known as the diffusion theory, states that the mucoadhesive molecules and mucus glycoproteins mutually interact by means of interpenetration of their chains and the forming of secondary semi-permanent adhesive bonds. It is necessary that the mucoadhesive device has features or properties that favor both chemical and mechanical interactions for the macromolecular interpenetration theory to take place. Molecules that can present mucoadhesive properties are molecules with hydrogen bond building groups, high molecular weight, flexible chains, and surface active properties.

It is perceived that increase in adhesion force is associated with the degree of penetration of polymer chains. Literature states that the degree of penetration required for efficient bioadhesive bonds lies in the range of 0.2-0.5μm. The following equation can be used to estimate the degree of penetration of polymer and mucus chains:

with  as contact time and  as the diffusion coefficient of the mucoadhesive material in the mucus. Maximum adhesion strength is reached when penetration depth is approximately equal to polymer chain size. Properties of mutual solubility and structural similarity will improve the mucoadhesive bond.

Dehydration theory 

The dehydration theory explains why mucoadhesion can arise rapidly. When two gels capable of rapid gelation in an aqueous environment are brought into contact, movement occurs between the two gels until a state of equilibrium is reached. Gels associated with a strong affinity for water will have high osmotic pressures and large swelling forces. The difference in osmotic pressure when these gels contact mucus gels will draw water into the formulation and quickly dehydrate the mucus gel, forcing intermixing and consolidation until equilibrium results.

This mixture of formulation and mucus can increase contact time with the mucous membrane, leading to the consolidation of the adhesive bond. However, the dehydration theory does not apply to solid formulations or highly hydrated forms.

Mucoadhesives in drug delivery 
Depending on the dosage form and route of administration, mucoadhesives may be used for either local or systemic drug delivery. An overview on the mucoadhesive properties of mucoadhesives is provided by Vjera Grabovac and Andreas Bernkop-Schnürch. The bioavailability of such drugs is affected by many factors unique to each route of application. In general, mucoadhesives work to increase the contact time at these sites, prolonging the residence time and maintaining an effective release rate. These polymeric coatings may be applied to a wide variety of liquid and solid dosages, each specially suited for the route of administration.

Dosage Forms

Tablets
Tablets are small, solid dosages suitable for the use of mucoadhesive coatings. The coating may be formulated to adhere to a specific mucosa, enabling both systemic and targeted local administration. Tablets are generally taken enterally, as the size and stiffness of the form results in poor patient compliance when administered through other routes.

Patches
In general, patches consist of three separate layers that contribute and control the release of medicine. The outer impermeable backing layer controls the direction of release and reduces drug loss away from the site of contact. It also protects the other layers and acts as a mechanical support. The middle reservoir layer holds the drug and is tailored to provide the specified dosage. The final inner layer consists of the mucoadhesive, allowing the patch to adhere to the specified mucosa.

Gels
As a liquid or semisolid dosage, gels are typically used where a solid form would affect the patient’s comfort. As a trade-off, conventional gels have poor retention rates. This results in unpredictable losses of the drug, as the non-solid dosage is unable to maintain its position at the site of administration. Mucoadhesives increase retention by dynamically increasing the viscosity of the gel after application. This allows the gel to effectively administer the drug at the local site while maintaining the comfort of the patient.

Solutions
These dosage forms are commonly used to deliver drugs to the eye and nasal cavity. They often include mucoadhesive polymers to improve retention on dynamic mucosal surfaces. Some advanced eye drop formulations may also turn from a liquid to a gel (so called in situ gelling systems) upon drug administration. For example, gel-forming solutions containing Pluronics could be used to improve the efficiency of eye drops and provide better retention on ocular surfaces.

Routes of Administration

Oromucosal
With a 0.1-0.7 mm thick mucus layer, the oral cavity serves as an important route of administration for mucoadhesive dosages. Permeation sites can be separated into two groups: sublingual and buccal, in which the former is much more permeable than the latter. However, the sublingual mucosa also produces more saliva, resulting in relatively low retention rates. Thus, sublingual mucosa is preferable for rapid onset and short duration treatments, while the buccal mucosa is more appropriate for longer dosage and onset times. Because of this dichotomy, the oral cavity is suitable for both local and systemic administration. Some common dosage forms for the oral cavity include gels, ointments, patches, and tablets. Depending on the dosage form, some drug loss can occur due to swallowing of saliva. This can be minimized by layering the side of the dosage facing the oral cavity with an impermeable coating(,) commonly seen in patches.

Nasal 
With an active surface area of 160 cm2, the nasal cavity is another noteworthy route of mucoadhesive administration. Due to the sweeping motion of the cilia that lines the mucosa, nasal mucus has a quick turnover of 10 to 15 minutes. Because of this, the nasal cavity is most suitable for rapid, local medicinal dosages. Additionally, its close proximity to the blood-brain barrier makes it a convenient route for administering specialized drugs to the central nervous system. Gels, solutions, and aerosols are common dosage forms in the nasal cavity. However, recent research into particles and microspheres have shown increased bioavailability over non-solid forms of medicine largely due to the use of mucoadhesives.

Ocular 
Within the eye, it is difficult to achieve therapeutic concentrations through systemic administration. Often, other parts of the body will reach toxic levels of the medication before the eye reaches the treatment concentration. Consequently, direct administration through the fibrous tunic is common. This is made difficult due to the numerous defense mechanisms in place, such as blinking, tear production, and the tightness of the corneal epithelium. Estimates put tear turnover rates at 5 minutes, meaning most conventional drugs are not retained for long periods of time. Mucoadhesives increase retention rates, either by enhancing the viscosity or bonding directly to one of the mucosae surrounding the eye.

Intravesical 
Intravesical drug administration is the delivery of pharmaceuticals to the urinary bladder through a catheter. This route of administration is used for the therapy of bladder cancer and interstitial cystitis. The retention of dosage forms in the bladder is relatively poor, which is related to the need for a periodical urine voiding. Some mucoadhesive materials are able to stick to mucosal lining in the bladder, resist urine wash out effects and provide a sustained drug delivery.

 1 -8.98453  Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone. At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose–Einstein condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale. This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single super atom, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.
 2 -9.05929 Liquid is one of the four fundamental states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma. It is characterized by its ability to flow and take on the shape of its container. Unlike solids, which have a fixed shape and volume, liquids do not have a definite shape but rather conform to the shape of their container. However, they do have a definite volume.

One key characteristic of liquids is their ability to form a distinct surface at the boundaries of their bulk material. This surface is known as a free surface and is where the liquid is not constrained by a container. The presence of this free surface allows liquids to exhibit properties such as capillary action and surface tension.

In terms of particle arrangement, liquids have particles that are close together but still able to move past one another. This enables them to flow easily compared to solids, where particles are tightly packed and held in fixed positions.

The behavior of liquids also differs from gases. While both can flow and take on the shape of their containers, gases expand more readily than liquids when heated due to the greater kinetic energy of gas particles. Liquids are generally denser than gases because their particles are closer together.

Overall, the characteristics that distinguish liquids from other states of matter include their ability to flow, take on the shape of their container while maintaining a distinct volume, form a free surface at boundaries, and exhibit intermediate particle arrangement between solids and gases.

 3 -10.01693  for the growth of the particles which will induce the growth of the pore as the high coordination number prohibits the growth towards the pore. For many materials, it can be seen from their phase diagram that multiple phases can exist at the same time. Those different phases might exhibit different crystal structure, thus exhibiting different mechanical properties. Furthermore, these different phases also exhibit a different microstructure (grain size, orientation). This can also improve some mechanical properties as crack deflection can occur, thus pushing the ultimate breakdown further as it creates a more tortuous crack path in the coarser microstructure.
 4 -10.53274 Water is an essential component in the hardening process of various materials. In the context of construction, water plays a crucial role in the hardening process of materials like cement. When cement is mixed with water, a chemical reaction called hydration occurs, leading to the formation of a strong and durable material known as concrete. Water acts as a crucial medium that facilitates the hydration process and allows the cement particles to react and bind together, resulting in a hard and solid structure.

Additionally, water is also used in the hardening process of various metals. In metallurgy, water is often utilized during the quenching process, which involves rapid cooling of heated metals. When a hot metal object is immersed in water, the rapid cooling helps in achieving their desired hardness and strength. Water acts as a means to transfer heat away from the metal, promoting the formation of a specific microstructure that contributes to the desired hardening properties.

Furthermore, water is utilized in the hardening process of certain organic materials, such as dental or orthopedic casts. These casts often contain materials like plaster of Paris, which harden when water is applied. The water triggers a chemical reaction that causes the plaster particles to undergo hydration, resulting in the creation of a rigid and solid structure.

In summary, water is used in the hardening process of various materials such as cement, metals, and organic compounds. Its role varies depending on the specific material, but generally, water acts as a medium for facilitating chemical reactions or as a means to regulate the temperature during the hardening process.
 5 -10.64775  inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.

['A microscope is an instrument used to make small objects appear larger. It consists of a lens system that magnifies the image of an object. The magnification of a microscope is the degree to which it enlarges an object. The magnification is determined by the size of the object being viewed and the power of the lens.\n\nThe basic components of a microscope include an objective lens, an eyepiece, and a stage. The objective lens is located at the bottom of the microscope and is responsible for magnifying the object. The eyepiece is located at the top of the microscope and is responsible for magnifying the image produced by the objective lens.\n\nThe objective lens is available in different magnifications, typically ranging from 4x to 100x. The higher the magnification, the smaller the field of view. The eyepiece is typically fixed at 10x, but can be replaced with a higher magnification eyepiece for even greater magnification.\n\nTo use a microscope, the object to be viewed is placed on the stage. The stage is adjustable to allow for the object to be positioned in the center of the field of view. The objective lens is then adjusted to focus on the object. The image produced by the objective lens is then magnified by the eyepiece to produce a final image that is viewed through the eyepiece.\n\nThe magnification of a microscope', 'How does a microscope make small things appear?How does a microscope make small things appear?\nA. humongous\nB. transparent\nC. discolored\nD. distorted']

   An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. It is so named because it is usually the lens that is closest to the eye when someone looks through the device. The objective lens or mirror collects light and brings it to focus creating an image. The eyepiece is placed near the focal point of the objective to magnify this image. The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece. An eyepiece consists of several "lens elements" in a housing, with a "barrel" on one end. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it

   A microscope slide is a thin flat piece of glass, typically 75 by 26 mm (3 by 1 inches) and about 1 mm thick, used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. Typically the object is mounted (secured) on the slide, and then both are inserted together in the microscope for viewing. This arrangement allows several slide-mounted objects to be quickly inserted and removed from the microscope, labeled, transported, and stored in appropriate slide cases or folders etc. Microscope slides are often used together with a cover slip or cover glass, a smaller and thinner sheet of glass that is placed over the specimen. Slides are held in place on the microscope's stage by slide clips, slide clamps or a cross-table which is used to achieve precise, remote movement of the slide upon the microscope's stage (such as in an automated/computer operated system, or where touching the slide with fingers is inappropriate either due to the risk of contamination or lack of precision).

  The stage of an inverted microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted by moving the objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment. Depending on the size of the microscope, four to six objective lenses of different magnifications may be fitted to a rotating turret known as a nosepiece. These microscopes may also be fitted with accessories for fitting still and video cameras, fluorescence illumination, confocal scanning and many other applications.

  An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. It was invented in 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member of Tulane University (then named the Medical College of Louisiana).

 A microscope produces a magnified image of an otherwise microscopic object for viewing through the human eye. Microscopes are employed in various fields of science and medicine to study objects in greater detail. There are various types of microscopes, including electron microscopes, optical microscopes, scanning microscopes and others.
An electron microscope (EM) illuminates an object (or specimen) by directing a beam of electrons on it, producing a magnified image of the specimen. Electron microscopes have a greater magnifying power than optical microscopes due to the use of shorter wavelength electrons. They allow magnifications of up to one million times the size of a specimen while optical microscopes can achieve a magnification of no greater than 1000x. There are various types of electron microscopes, including the reflection electron microscope (REM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), low voltage electron microscope (LVEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).
Specimens that are to be viewed under an electron microscope may require prior manipulation to produce best results. Chemical fixation, cryofixation, dehydration, sectioning, staining, and ion beam million are some of the techniques employed on specimens before being magnified. Electron microscopes are employed in various branches of biology and life sciences, including diagnosis, cryobiology, toxicology, particle analysis, 3D tissue imaging and virology.
A light microscope magnifies a specimen by employing a system of inbuilt lenses. The simplest light microscope uses a single magnifying lens. A light microscope allows color magnification—a distinct advantage over its electron counterpart, especially in forensic analysis. The major components of a light microscope are the eyepiece, turret, objective lenses, fine and coarse adjustment knobs, stage or object holder, illuminator (lights or mirror) and condenser with diaphragm. There are many types of optical microscopes, including the inverted microscope, research microscope, petrographic microscope, polarizing microscope, and the phase contrast microscope.
A dissecting microscope, also called a stereo microscope, enables three-dimensional viewing of a specimen. It uses two separate light paths, two eyepieces and two objectives to provide magnification from two different angles. Dissecting microscopes are used to view objects that are too thick for viewing with regular microscopes.
One type of dissecting microscope has been fitted with cameras and LCD screens. Specialized software is used to manipulate the two individual images to make a single 3D image, which is then viewed with cyan/plastic red glasses. A digital variant of this type of microscope comes with a USB attachment. The microscope can be plugged into a computer and the magnified image viewed directly on the screen. This type of microscope can produce object magnification of up to 200x, and is often inexpensive and portable. A dissecting microscope is used commonly for animal and tissue dissection.

  To create the necessary interference pattern, i.e., the hologram, the illumination needs to be a coherent (monochromatic) light source, a laser for example. As can be seen in Figure 2, the laser light is split into an object beam and a reference beam. The expanded object beam illuminates the sample to create the object wave front. After the object wave front is collected by a microscope objective, the object and reference wave fronts are joined by a beam splitter to interfere and create the hologram. Using the digitally recorded hologram, a computer acts as a digital lens and calculates a viewable image of the object wave front by using a numerical reconstruction algorithm. Commonly, a microscope objective is used to collect the object wave front. However, as the microscope

 The arrangement of lenses from the eye to the source of light in a light microscope typically includes the following lenses: the ocular lens, the objective lens, and the condenser lens.

The ocular lens, which is located at the eyepiece of the microscope, is responsible for magnifying the image formed by the objective lens. It helps further magnify the specimen and allows the viewer to see a detailed image.

The objective lens, on the other hand, is situated close to the specimen being observed. It is the main lens responsible for forming the initial magnified image of the specimen. Objective lenses are available in different magnifications, allowing users to choose the level of magnification needed for their specific observations.

Lastly, the condenser lens is located beneath the stage, where the specimen is placed. The condenser lens gathers and focuses light onto the specimen, facilitating a clearer and more detailed image. It helps ensure that the light is evenly distributed and properly directed onto the specimen for optimal visibility.

It's important to note that the arrangement of lenses may slightly differ depending on the microscope model or type, but the general arrangement usually involves these three main lenses: ocular lens, objective lens, and condenser lens.

 In a light microscope, the correct order of lenses from the eye to the source of light is as follows: ocular lens, objective lens, and condenser lens. 

The ocular lens, also known as the eyepiece, is the lens closest to the eye. It magnifies the image formed by the objective lens and allows us to view it with our eyes.

Next is the objective lens, which is located close to the specimen or object being observed. The objective lens collects light from the specimen and forms a magnified image. It typically has multiple lenses with different magnification powers that can be rotated into place as needed.

Lastly, the condenser lens is situated between the light source and the specimen. Its primary function is to gather and concentrate light onto the specimen, ensuring a well-illuminated view. The condenser lens helps improve the clarity and resolution of the observed image.

Remember, the correct order of lenses in a light microscope is ocular lens, objective lens, and condenser lens.

  One of the most important properties of microscope objectives is their magnification. The magnification typically ranges from 4× to 100×. It is combined with the magnification of the eyepiece to determine the overall magnification of the microscope; a 4× objective with a 10× eyepiece produces an image that is 40 times the size of the object. A typical microscope has three or four objective lenses with different magnifications, screwed into a circular "nosepiece" which may be rotated to select the required lens. These lenses are often color coded for easier use. The least powerful lens is called the scanning objective lens, and is typically a 4× objective. The second lens is referred to as the small objective lens and is typically a 10× lens. The most powerful lens out of the three is referred to as the large objective lens and is typically 40–100×.

  attached. The image can be focused by moving the eyepiece nearer and further from the objective. Most instruments have a focusing mechanism to allow movement of the shaft in which the eyepiece is mounted, without needing to manipulate the eyepiece directly. The eyepieces of binoculars are usually permanently mounted in the binoculars, causing them to have a pre-determined magnification and field of view. With telescopes and microscopes, however, eyepieces are usually interchangeable. By switching the eyepiece, the user can adjust what is viewed. For instance, eyepieces will often be interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification of a telescope. Eyepieces also offer varying fields of view, and differing degrees of eye relief for the person who looks through them.

  The motor system is the set of central and peripheral structures in the nervous system that support motor functions, i.e. movement. Peripheral structures may include skeletal muscles and neural connections with muscle tissues. Central structures include cerebral cortex, brainstem, spinal cord, pyramidal system including the upper motor neurons, extrapyramidal system, cerebellum, and the lower motor neurons in the brainstem and the spinal cord.

  Skeletal muscle, or "voluntary muscle", is a striated muscle tissue that primarily joins to bone with tendons. Skeletal muscle enables movement of bones, and maintains posture. The widest part of a muscle that pulls on the tendons is known as the belly.

  Routine physical activity is important for building strong bones and muscles in children, but it is equally important as we get older. Your bones and muscles work together to support every movement you make on a daily basis. When you are physically active you strengthen your muscles. Your bones adapt by building more cells and as a result both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improves balance and coordination. In addition active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved flexibility. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. Even if you have arthritis, exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to every move you make without the hassle of an actual brace that you have to put on and take off.

 The main functions of the skeletal system are to provide support, protect internal organs, and allow for movement. The skeleton serves as a strong framework that shapes and supports the body. It provides structural support to maintain the body's posture and enables us to stand upright.

Another important function of the skeletal system is to protect vital internal organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. 

Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement. The bones, joints, and muscles work together to allow for various types of movement, such as walking, running, and grasping objects. The bones act as levers, while the joints provide flexibility and allow for smooth movement. Muscles, attached to the bones via tendons, contract and relax to create movement.

In summary, the skeletal system provides support, protects internal organs, and enables movement in the body.

  The brain serves as the organic basis of cognition and exerts centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain is protected by the skull; however, if the brain is damaged, significant impairments in cognition and physiological function or death may occur.

 The skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs in several ways. Firstly, the rigidity of our bones allows them to protect our internal organs from damage. For example, the rib cage and the skull protect our lungs and brain, respectively. The pelvis also protects the abdominal and reproductive organs.

Additionally, the skeleton provides a framework for the attachment of skeletal muscles through tendons, as well as the attachment of ligaments. This allows the skeletal system to provide a lever system for joint motion and movement. Different joints have different ranges of movement, with some joints like the ball and socket joint offering a broader range of movement compared to others.

Moreover, the skeletal frame provides a structural framework, giving the body a supportive structure for soft tissues and shaping the body. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would simply collapse.

The skeletal system also plays a role in mineral storage. Bones store essential minerals such as calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, which are crucial for growth and bone health. These minerals can be released into the bloodstream as needed by the body. Additionally, bone marrow can store iron and is involved in iron metabolism, while yellow bone marrow stores fat.

Furthermore, the bone marrow found within the bones is responsible for the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets through a process called hematopoiesis. This ensures a steady supply of new blood cells for the body's functions.

In summary, the skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs through its rigidity, attachment points for muscles and ligaments, structural framework, and mineral storage capabilities.

 The main functions of the skeletal system in the human body are as follows:

1. Support: The skeletal system provides structural support and framework for the body. It gives shape to the body and maintains its posture.

2. Protection: The bones of the skeleton protect vital organs of the body. For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribcage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord.

3. Movement: Muscles attach to the bones and use them as levers to generate movement. The skeletal system, along with the muscular system, allows us to perform various physical activities and movements.

4. Blood Cell Production: The bone marrow, located inside certain bones such as the long bones, is responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These blood cells are essential for the transportation of oxygen, fighting infections, and blood clotting, respectively.

5. Mineral Storage: Bones serve as a reservoir for important minerals, including calcium and phosphorus. These minerals are necessary for various bodily functions such as muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. When the body needs these minerals, it can release them from the bones.

6. Hematopoiesis: In addition to blood cell production, the bone marrow also plays a role in hematopoiesis, which is the formation and development of blood cells.

7. Movement and Locomotion: The skeletal system, along with muscles and joints, enables movement and locomotion, allowing us to walk, run, jump, and perform other activities.

It is important to note that the skeletal system is composed of 206 bones in an adult human body, with each bone serving different functions and contributing to the overall functioning of the system.

   Derived from the Greek ἀνατομή anatomē "dissection" (from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά aná "up", and τέμνω témnō "I cut"), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs and tissues. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the

 1 -0.01211 The skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs in several ways. Firstly, the rigidity of our bones allows them to protect our internal organs from damage. For example, the rib cage and the skull protect our lungs and brain, respectively. The pelvis also protects the abdominal and reproductive organs.

Additionally, the skeleton provides a framework for the attachment of skeletal muscles through tendons, as well as the attachment of ligaments. This allows the skeletal system to provide a lever system for joint motion and movement. Different joints have different ranges of movement, with some joints like the ball and socket joint offering a broader range of movement compared to others.

Moreover, the skeletal frame provides a structural framework, giving the body a supportive structure for soft tissues and shaping the body. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would simply collapse.

 2 -0.02962 The main functions of the skeletal system are to provide support, protect internal organs, and allow for movement. The skeleton serves as a strong framework that shapes and supports the body. It provides structural support to maintain the body's posture and enables us to stand upright.

Another important function of the skeletal system is to protect vital internal organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. 

Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement. The bones, joints, and muscles work together to allow for various types of movement, such as walking, running, and grasping objects. The bones act as levers, while the joints provide flexibility and allow for smooth movement. Muscles, attached to the bones via tendons, contract and relax to create movement.

In summary, the skeletal system provides support, protects internal organs, and enables movement in the body.

["The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the ocean, casting a warm orange glow over the sandy shore. The sound of waves crashing against the shore was the only sound that could be heard. Suddenly, a rustling in the sand caught the attention of a group of onlookers. A sea turtle was emerging from its shell, its tiny flippers flailing as it struggled to make its way towards the water. The crowd watched in awe as the hatchling made its way towards the ocean, its journey fraught with danger from predators and human interference.\n\nThe sea turtle's journey to the ocean is a perilous one. The hatchlings are born with an instinct to head towards the water, but they must navigate through miles of sand and avoid predators such as seagulls and crabs. Once they reach the water, they must face the challenges of surviving in the open ocean, where they are vulnerable to larger predators such as sharks.\n\nDespite the odds, sea turtles have been around for over 100 million years, and their survival is crucial to the health of the ocean's ecosystem. They play a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ocean's food chain, and their eggs are a source of food for many predators.\n\nThe sea turtle's journey to the ocean is a symbol of the resilience and determination", 'Live birth is exemplified inLive birth is exemplified in\nA. snakes slithering out of eggs\nB. a calf emerging from a mother giraffe\nC. owlets pecking out of their encasement\nD. sea turtles emerging from their shells']

  by vehicles driving on the beaches can trap the hatchlings on their journey to the sea. Coastal development contributes to barriers that make it difficult or impossible for adult turtles to reach nesting and feeding sites. The flatback sea turtle also falls prey to incidental capture. It is caught by fishermen, particularly by trawling, gillnet fishing, ghost nets, and crab pots. Lastly, pollution is a concern for this creature. Pollution can affect the timing of egg laying, how it chooses its nesting site, how hatchlings find the sea after emerging, and how adult turtles find the beaches.

  A female loggerhead turtle follows the path of her ancestors on one of the most extraordinary journeys in the natural world. From a beach in Florida, she rides the Gulf Stream to the frozen north, swimming around the entire North Atlantic to Africa and then back to the beach where she was born. But her chance of survival is low. Each season, two million loggerhead turtles are hatched but just one in ten thousand turtles will return safely to lay their eggs.

  The Australian flatback sea turtle (Natator depressus) is a species of sea turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. This turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other sea turtles. It can be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other sea turtle hatchlings when they hatch. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It was previously listed as vulnerable in 1994. It is not as threatened as other sea turtles due to its small dispersal range. This animal can be 31 to 37 inches long and about 100kg in weight

  then set off to track the turtle, and finally captured one by the coast at Broad Sound. They hauled it back to camp, encircled it with stones and set it to cook on a fire, and, left it to bake while they went off for further game. In their absence, the turtle escaped, and it required several days for them to track it down and recapture again. The scenario repeated itself a third time, only on this final occasion, it proved to be anchored down too firmly to lift, until they levered up its legs. At this point, the turtle kicked out, flipping the brothers over its head, transforming the landscape into a sea, into which they plummeted. Both the brothers and their grandmother

  The hatchlings begin to leave the nests during the beginning of December, and the clutches will continue to hatch until late March. The peak of hatchling emergence can be seen during February. A flatback sea turtle hatchling is larger than other sea turtle hatchlings with its carapace length averaging 60 mm. Its large size helps protect it from some of the predators after hatching, and allows it to also be a stronger swimmers. The hatchlings tend to stay close to shore and lack the pelagic phase of other sea turtles. The hatchlings will feed on the macroplankton present in their surface-dwelling environment.

  Most sea turtle mortality happens early in life. Sea turtles usually lay around 100 eggs at a time, but on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood. Raccoons, foxes, and seabirds may raid nests or hatchlings may be eaten within minutes of hatching as they make their initial run for the ocean. Once in the water, they are susceptible to seabirds, large fish and even other sea turtles. Adult sea turtles have few predators. Large aquatic carnivores such as sharks and crocodiles are their biggest threats; however, reports of terrestrial predators attacking nesting females are not uncommon. Jaguars have been reported to smash into sea turtle shells with their paws, and scoop out the flesh. Fibropapillomatosis disease causes tumors in sea turtles. While many of the things that endanger sea turtles are natural predators, increasingly many threats to the sea turtle species have arrived with the ever-growing presence of humans.

  also have been found to have longer tails than their male counterparts. Features of this sea turtle which help contribute to its recognition are the single pair of prefrontal scales on the head, and the four pairs of costal scutes on the carapace. Another unique feature of this species of sea turtle is the fact that its carapace is found to be much thinner than other sea turtle carapaces. This feature causes the shell to crack under the smallest pressures. The skull superficially resembles that of the olive ridley but details of the braincase most closely resemble those found in the green sea turtle

   Sea turtles play key roles in two habitat types: oceans and beaches/dunes. In the oceans, sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are among the very few creatures (manatees are another) that eat sea grass. Sea grass needs to be constantly cut short to help it grow across the sea floor. Sea turtle grazing helps maintain the health of the sea grass beds. Sea grass beds provide breeding and developmental grounds for numerous marine animals. Without them, many marine species humans harvest would be lost, as would the lower levels of the food chain. The reactions could result in many more marine species eventually becoming endangered or extinct. Sea turtles use beaches and sand dunes as to lay their eggs. Such coastal environments are nutrient-poor and depend on vegetation to protect against erosion. Eggs, hatched or unhatched, and hatchlings that fail to make it into the ocean are nutrient sources for dune vegetation and therefore protecting these nesting habitats for sea turtles, forming a positive feedback loop. Sea turtles also maintain a symbiotic relationship with yellow tang, in which the fish will eat algae growing on the shell of a sea turtle.

  All marine turtles are faced with threats such as habitat loss, the wildlife trade, collection of eggs, collection of meat, by-catch, pollution, and climate change. The flatback sea turtle is specifically threatened by the direct harvest of eggs and meat by the indigenous people of Australia for traditional hunting. These people are given the right to harvest by the government, but only if for non-commercial purposes. Another threat is the destruction of nesting beaches due to coastal development and the destruction of feeding sites at coral reefs and the shallow areas near the shore. Camping on these beaches compacts the sand and contributes to dune erosion, and the wheel ruts

  One of the greatest threats to the survival of hatchlings is artificial lighting. When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new ecosystem. However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially. With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle's natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest visible light. With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful

Jaguars have been reported to smash into sea turtle shells with their paws, and scoop out the flesh. Fibropapillomatosis disease causes tumors in sea turtles. While many of the things that endanger sea turtles are natural predators, increasingly many threats to the sea turtle species have arrived with the ever-growing presence of humans.
 2 -10.06911   Sea turtles play key roles in two habitat types: oceans and beaches/dunes. In the oceans, sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are among the very few creatures (manatees are another) that eat sea grass. Sea grass needs to be constantly cut short to help it grow across the sea floor. Sea turtle grazing helps maintain the health of the sea grass beds. Sea grass beds provide breeding and developmental grounds for numerous marine animals. Without them, many marine species humans harvest would be lost, as would the lower levels of the food chain. The reactions could result in many more marine species eventually becoming endangered or extinct. Sea turtles use beaches and sand dunes as to lay their eggs. Such coastal environments are nutrient-poor and depend on vegetation to protect against erosion. Eggs, hatched or unhatched, and hatchlings that fail to make it into the ocean are nutrient sources for dune vegetation and therefore protecting these nesting habitats for sea turtles, forming a positive feedback loop. Sea turtles also maintain a symbiotic relationship with yellow tang, in which the fish will eat algae growing on the shell of a sea turtle.
 3 -10.15814  also have been found to have longer tails than their male counterparts. Features of this sea turtle which help contribute to its recognition are the single pair of prefrontal scales on the head, and the four pairs of costal scutes on the carapace. Another unique feature of this species of sea turtle is the fact that its carapace is found to be much thinner than other sea turtle carapaces. This feature causes the shell to crack under the smallest pressures. The skull superficially resembles that of the olive ridley but details of the braincase most closely resemble those found in the green sea turtle
 4 -10.17436  The Australian flatback sea turtle (Natator depressus) is a species of sea turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. This turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other sea turtles. It can be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other sea turtle hatchlings when they hatch. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It was previously listed as vulnerable in 1994. It is not as threatened as other sea turtles due to its small dispersal range. This animal can be 31 to 37 inches long and about 100kg in weight
 5 -10.32457  One of the greatest threats to the survival of hatchlings is artificial lighting. When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new ecosystem. However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially. With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle's natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest visible light. With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful

['The world\'s islands are disappearing at an alarming rate due to rising sea levels caused by global warming. According to a recent report by the United Nations, over 1,000 islands have already been lost, and thousands more are at risk.\n\nThe report, which was compiled by the UN\'s Environment Programme (UNEP), highlights the devastating impact that climate change is having on the world\'s island nations. The report states that "these islands are not just disappearing, they are being eroded, and their populations are being forced to move."\n\nThe report also notes that the loss of these islands is not just an environmental issue, but a humanitarian one as well. The displacement of island populations is causing social and economic upheaval, as well as political instability.\n\nThe report calls for urgent action to address the root causes of climate change, and to provide support to the island nations that are most affected. The report also calls for the development of new technologies and strategies to help these nations adapt to the changing climate.\n\nIn terms of the number of islands, the report notes that the number of islands will continue to decrease as sea levels rise. The report estimates that by the end of the century, over 10,000 islands could be lost, and millions of people could be displaced.\n\nThe report also highlights the need for international cooperation to address this issue.

  through hazards posed by sea level rise, such as flooding and permanent submergence. This could lead to statelessness for populations in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu. In some regions, rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to. With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the Sahara. These factors, plus weather extremes, can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries. Displacement of people is expected to increase as a consequence of more frequent extreme weather, sea level rise, and conflict arising from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to "trapped populations" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.

  Economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a probability of disastrous tail-risk events. Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue. Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where existing poverty is already exacerbated. The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030. Current inequalities between men and women, between rich and poor, and between different ethnicities have been observed to worsen as a consequence of climate variability and climate change. An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities, but that future warming will bring increasing risks.

  As many of tribal communities are in coastal areas and depend on the swamps and bayous as a source of food and economic resource, they have been severely and adversely affected by the continuing coastal erosion and loss of wetlands. Different factors associated with industrialization have contributed to such losses, including dredging of navigation canals by shipping and oil companies, which increased water movement and erosion, increasing salt water intrusion and causing loss of wetlands plants. In addition, oil companies have buried piping under the ground but not covered it sufficiently. The community of Isle de Jean Charles has suffered severe erosion; scientists estimate that the island will be lost by 2030 if no restoration takes place. The Houma tribe is looking for land in the area to buy in order to resettle all of the community together. Coastal erosion has adversely affected the quality of fishing. The tribe has suffered from a decrease in fish, as saltwater intrusion has destroyed many of the old fishing holes.

 Health, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” By implication this involves a feeling of well-being that is enjoyed by individual when the body systems are functioning effectively and efficiently together and in harmony with the environment in order to achieve the objectives of good living.

Good health and well-being is the focal point for a sustainable development and prosperous society. In Nigeria, there has been a major progress in the improvement of health since 1950. Although, lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders and HIV/AIDS have ranked the topmost causes of deaths in Nigeria, in the case of other diseases such as polio, malaria and tuberculosis, progress has been achieved. Among other threats to health are malnutrition, pollution and road traffic accidents. In 2020, Nigeria had one of the highest cases of COVID-19 in Africa.

Health can be measured by indicators such as life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, under-5 child mortality (U5MR) rate, and maternal mortality rate. However, features relating to personal and inborn of individuals such as age, sex, and genetic make-up are factors that help to determine health. Other factors which affect health include socio-economic status, culture, education, indoor/outdoor environment, nutritional status, people’s own health practices and behaviours (for example the ability to identify when a family member is sick), as well as government approaches to policies and programs in its sectors, especially in the health sector.

Life expectancy and Under- 5 mortality rate 

Life expectancy at birth in Nigeria is on the increase. It increased from 49.4 in 2007 to approximately 54 in 2017. In a decade (2007 – 2017), U5MR per 1000 live births drastically reduced from 145.7 to 100.2. In comparison with some other reference countries (Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Norway, United States of America, China and Australia), as shown in the second Table below, Nigeria with a population of about 195 million has performed poorly. Also, the country has not done better when compared with the world average and the World Bank regions namely: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Maternal mortality 

Maternal mortality rate in Nigeria is above 800 per 100,000 live births. In 2013, the rate in Nigeria was 560 deaths per 100,000 live births; whereas in 1980, it was 516 deaths 100,000 per live births. This may be as a result of poor health facilities, lack of access to quality health care, malnutrition due to poverty, herder-farmer conflicts, female genital mutilations, abortions, and displacements due to Boko Haram terrorism in the North East of Nigeria. In Nigeria the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 22. Nigeria’s abortion laws make it one of the most restrictive countries regarding abortion.

A study published in 2019 investigated the competency of emergency obstetric care among health providers and found it lower than average. Another evidence-based study shows decrease in maternal mortality in the southern part of the country while it’s still on the increase in North due to low level of education.

Maternal mortality affects the socioeconomic development of the country negatively. By 2030, if Nigeria is to reduce maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births (SDG goal 3 – target 1), all hands must be on deck to achieve it. People can start by promoting and protecting their own health and the health of those around them, by making well-informed choices, practising safe sex and attending antenatal care in government approved health centres. There should be more awareness in communities about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children. Government, local leaders and other decision makers should be held accountable to their commitments to improve people’s access to health and health care.

Water supply and sanitation 

Access to an improved water source stagnated at 47% of the population from 1990 to 2006, then increased to 54% in 2010. In urban areas access decreased from 80% to 65% in 2006, and then recovered to 74% in 2010.

Adequate sanitation is typically in the form of septic tanks, liam as there is no central sewage system, except for Abuja and some areas of Lagos. A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were connected to general sewers. In 2016, mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene is 68.6 deaths per 100,000 populations.

HIV/AIDS 

Nigeria HIV/AIDS indicator and impact survey (NAIIS) 2018 revealed that the national HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 is 1.4 percent. The prevalence of HIV in Nigeria varies widely by region and states. Akwa Ibom State has the highest prevalence rate of HIV with 5.6 percent and disease burden of 200,051 percentage of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and followed by Benue State (4.9%, 188,482 DALYs) and Rivers (3.8%, 196,225 DALYs). The States, Jigawa (12,804 DALYs) and Katsina (26,597DALYs) both have the least prevalence rate of 0.3 percent. The epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high-risk behaviors, including having multiple sexual partners, low risk perceptions, inadequate access to quality health care services, as well as street/road hawking of goods by itinerant workers (hawkers) especially, around military and police checkpoints. Other risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV, including prostitution, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), clandestine high-risk homosexual/heterosexual practices, and women trafficking. Youths and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV, with young women at higher risk than young men.

Malaria 
Malaria, a disease caused by mosquitoes has resulted in untold morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Although, there has been slight decline in malarial transmission and deaths since 2007 it ranked the number one cause of deaths in the country, the disease still remain unflagging. As of 2012, the malaria prevalence rate was 11 percent. A part of this data is from the President's Malaria Initiative which identifies Nigeria as a high-burden country. Nigeria's branch dealing with this problem, the National Malaria Control Program recognized the problem and embraced the World Malaria Day theme of "End Malaria for Good".

In 2017, according to IHME ranking, malaria ranked the fourth on the causes of most deaths in Nigeria with U5MR and under-1 child mortality of 103.2 deaths and 62.6 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively. With pockets of high-level transmission persisting in states across Nigeria coupled with the never-ending struggle against drug and insecticide resistance as well as the socio-economic costs associated with a failure to eradicate the disease, malaria eradication by 2050 seems unachievable. However, the step to eradicate the disease is a bold attainable goal if concerted efforts are put in place. The challenge of ineffective management of malaria prevention and control programs and inadequate use of data to inform strategies should be addressed. The control of mosquitoes, high quality diagnosis, and treatment are very necessary if the problem is to be successfully eradicated. Strong and committed leadership at various levels of government in Nigeria, reinforced through transparency and independent accountability mechanisms are very important to ensure a complete eradication of malaria in the country.

Endemic diseases 
In 1985, an incidence of yellow fever devastated a town in Nigeria, leading to the death of 1000 people. In a span of 5 years, the epidemic grew, with a resulting rise in mortality. The yellow fever vaccine has been in existence since the 1930s. There are other endemic diseases in the country which include malaria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, and meningitis. Travelers are normally advised to get travel vaccines and medicines because of the risk of these diseases in the country.

Food
Nutrition, especially in the North of the country, is often poor. Since 2002 food staples are supposed to be fortified with nutrients such as vitamin A, folic acid, zinc, iodine and iron. Bill Gates, said there had been “pushback” by some in Nigerian industry as this reduced profit margins. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is donating $5m over four years to implement a rigorous testing regime to make sure these standards are met.  These nutrients would reach poorer children who ate mainly a cereal and beans diet at very low cost and reduce the risk of stunting.  Vitamin A would reduce the risk of death from measles or diarrhoea. In some districts 7% of children die before they reach the age of five.  Nearly half of these are attributable to malnutrition. Aliko Dangote, whose companies supply salt, sugar and flour, said there would need to be a crack down on the import of low-quality foodstuff, often smuggled into local markets.

Pollution 
Traffic congestion in Lagos, environmental pollution:water pollution, and air pollution; and noise pollution are major health issues.

Water pollution

The aquatic systems in Nigeria, no doubt, are reservoirs for toxic chemicals and dead-ends for different kinds of chemical compounds and their products. The activities of oil and gas industries as well as widespread discharge of effluents into water ways is an eyesore. Chemical substances such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as well as heavy metals from point (see point pollution) and non-point (see nonpoint pollution) sources finds their way into oceans, rivers and streams and contaminates it. In 2018, The Nation newspaper reported improper waste disposal in the country, emphasizing that there is no proper waste management system, hence the cause of the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, used polythene bags, plastic bottles and other liquid and solid wastes in the environment. The Huffingtonpost in May 2017 raised an alarm on the incessant dumping of plastics in the ocean. It posited that 'the oceans are drowning in plastics – and no one is paying attention to the menace'; and by indication, it seems people are overwhelmed by their own waste. Amidst this, Ellen MacArthur Foundation in Partnership with the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh fish. With expected surge in consumption, negative externalities related to plastics will multiply by that time. Most wastes materials contain estrogenic chemicals -  (estrogens) and androgenic chemicals - (androgens) and they have potential to leach into the surrounding environment, impact on the ecosystem and may alter hormonal functions. These contaminants and many other chemicals are toxic to aquatic lives, most often affecting their life spans and ability to reproduce; they make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey and bioaccumulate in the adipose tissues of these organisms.

Air pollution

Nigeria air quality is said to be among the most unsafe globally (ranked 4th) and four of its major cities – Onitsha, Aba, Kaduna, and Umuahia are among the worst polluted cities in the world in term of particulate matter of size 10micrometer and below (PM10) and the most recent report by WHO indicate that the country’s annual mean concentration PM2.5 is 72ug/m3 far exceeding the recommended maximum of 10ug/m3. l Data from the institutes of Health Metrics and Evaluation on Global disease burden (GBD) was used to ascertain the cause of death and DALYs in Nigeria from 2007 – 2017 and published literature where reviewed. According to World Health data report, most of the highest ranked causes of DALYs are related to environmental risk factors including chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disease, which has cause about 800 thousand death and 26million DALYs per year in Nigeria. Major environmental risk include indoor air pollution, ambient air pollution, water , sanitation and hygiene, although there is prolong and progressive decline in these except ambient PM and ground ozone pollution which show a steady rise associated with death and DALYs in Nigeria indicating a significant concern in environment health situation.

What then is the cause?

The etiology of Nigeria air pollution is a complex story and ranges from activities of people to disaster both man-made and natural causes
Firstly, Nigeria is “home” to a lot of automobiles including car, motorbikes, heavy duty vehicles like bus, lorries etc that are old and has past their best days in term of energy efficiency thus, they emit a lot of unhealthy fumes including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon dioxides, carbon monoxides, particulate matter etc.
Secondly, large amount of waste across the country including household and industrial are disposed by combustion which releases fumes from both organic items, synthetic material like plastic, rubber as well as from dangerous items like batteries and e-waste etc
Most household also contributes thirdly to emission of noxious smokes and particulate matters like carbon soot etc as they rely on inefficient kerosene stoves, fire wood and charcoal for cooking and most time this is done indoor with poor ventilation.
Many offices and residences contributes to increased pollution level of the air with noxious fumes from generators which are used as substitute to the public epileptic power supply and these fumes are often released in largely unventilated areas. 
Other major sources including emission from factories and industries which release similar fumes like automobiles but uses mainly diesel in lieu of gasoline

Road traffic accidents 
Every year the lives of approximately 1.25 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years.

Over 3 400 people die on the world's roads every day and tens of millions of people are injured or disabled every year. Children, pedestrians, cyclists and older people are among the most vulnerable of road users. WHO works with partners - governmental and nongovernmental - around the world to raise the profile of the preventability of road traffic injuries and promote good practice related to addressing key behaviour risk factors – speed, drink-driving, the use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints.

With the continued dangerous trend of road traffic collision in Nigeria, which in 2013 placed it as one of the most road traffic accident (RTA) prone countries worldwide (the most in Africa), the Nigerian government saw the need to establish the present Federal Road Safety Corps in 1988 to address the carnage on the highways.

Level and trend of road traffic accidents
The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 456 people died and 3404 others were injured in 826 accidents recorded nationwide in January (2018).

The FRSC stated this in its CCC report for January signed by its Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi.

Causes of road traffic accidents 
The causes of road traffic accidents depend on a list of factors which can be broadly divided into:
(i). Vehicle operator or driver factors
(ii). Vehicle factors
(iii). Road pavement condition factors
(iv). Environmental factors.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals 
In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. 
The Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
The Target 3.6 under goal 3 is designed specifically to addresses the issue of road traffic accident: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has put some mechanisms in place to ensure implementation of the SDGs in the country however, Nigeria is still far from achieving this goal.

Traditional/Alternative medicine
As recent reports have shown, in addition to the many benefits there are also risks associated with the different types of Traditional Medicine / Complementary or alternative Medicine. Although consumers today have widespread access to various TM/CAM treatments and therapies, they often do not have enough information on what to check when using TM/CAM in order to avoid unnecessary harm. While traditional medicine has a lot to contribute to the health and economy, much harm has resulted from unregulated sale and misuse of traditional/alternative medicine and herbs in the country and has significantly delayed patients' seeking professional healthcare.

Potential Impact of Climate Change on Health in Nigeria

In recent times, more attention has been drawn to the effects of climate change around the world. A lot of unprecedented changes are being recorded in the weather conditions of different regions and countries. These have manifested in form of wildfires, torrential rains and other extreme weather outcomes. It has been pointed out that the health effects of climate change will increase dramatically over the next few years and pose a risk to human life and the well-being of billions of people.

With around 200 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa. As the continent’s main exporter of oil, Nigeria faces the challenge of balancing global energy demands and domestic economic stability with the need to address climate and environmental challenges. The impact of climate change in Nigeria could include rising temperatures, more intense and frequent extreme weather events and sea level rise. For the population, this could result in increased water and food insecurity, higher exposure to heat stress and ultraviolet radiation; changes in infectious and vector-borne disease transmission patterns; and an increased threat to coastal communities facing sea level rise. It is however important to add that adequate adaptation and mitigation could help to protect the population, presenting opportunities for actions towards better health outcomes even in the face of numerous challenges posed by climate change. 

The greatest health risk is for illness to result in mortality. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate prevalent diseases as well as emerging ones like High blood pressure, psychosis, neurosis and congenital malformations. Climate change creates overwhelming problems for an already impoverished populace.

Flooding is a consequence of climate change from rise in see level and poor infrastructure, especially with drainage systems planning and design. For instance, southern Nigeria is highly susceptible to flooding; particularly Lagos, the commercial hub of the country, which is said to be one meter above the sea level, is threatened with possible extinction. The direct health implications of flooding could be deduced to include direct water borne diseases like typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria. These, as we will see in the table below are diseases that already immensely burden the Nigerian populace.

Furthermore, The WHO has identified Schistosomiasis, African Trypanosomiasis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and leishmaniasis as “major tropical diseases”. This is in consideration of their public health significance and economic consequences on afflicted individuals, families and societies. The devastating effects of these diseases are summarized in the words of Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, former Director General, WHO: “beyond their toll of individual illness and death, these tropical diseases have insidious effects on society. They impede on national and individual development, make fertile land inhospitable, impair intellectual and physical growth and exact a huge cost in terms of treatment and control”. 

Meningitis, measles, chicken pox and other health risks like high blood pressure and dehydration in pregnancy are also believed to be amplified by high temperatures. The number of people in emerging countries is expected to increase by 2.3 billion in 2005 to 4 billion in 2030. This means more carbon emotions due to human activities. Growing urban sprawls, including poor housing also further compounds the problem. These changes inevitably increase the peril heat waves in the cities due to the effects of Climate change.

Additionally, high temperature affects diseases spread and rates of transmission of vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases. Temperature affects pathogen maturation rate and mosquito replication, the insect’s density in a specific area, and increases infection likelihood. Malaria parasites are recognized to remain sensitive to temperature, particularly throughout the so-called extrinsic period of incubation for parasite lifecycle, which happens once the parasite remains alive in the mosquitos. For example, warmer temperatures promote faster reproductive cycles in mosquitoes that transit malaria and in the parasite itself.

Although Nigeria has identified with the rest of the world in acknowledging climate change and its potential impacts for health and wellbeing, there are still gaps in the planning and implementation of actions to mitigate these effects. The WHO- Climate and Health Country Profile for Nigeria (2015), highlights the successes and shortcomings that characterize the country’s climate change response. These include: identifying a national focal point for climate change in the Ministry of Health and the development of a national health adaptation strategy. However, no actions have been implemented towards building institutional and technical capacities to work on climate change and health. Also, Nigeria has climate information included in its Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, including development of early warning and response systems for climate-sensitive health risks. Albeit, no activities have been implanted to increase resilience of health infrastructure. Finally, it is important to note that no financial commitments (both domestic and international funds) have been made to implements any action towards health resilience to climate change. 

These gaps present opportunities for actions, the implementation of which has potential to better prepare Nigeria as a country to mitigate the health risks that climate change poses to its people. The WHO suggests a comprehensive vulnerability and adaptation assessment with a focus on health that includes relevant stakeholders from all sectors and an estimate of the costs to implement health resilience to climate change, covering infrastructure as well as institutional and technical capacities. Furthermore, actions need to be taken, that will ensure greening of the health sector, such as promoting the use of renewable energy, and finally, conducting a valuation of the co-benefits to health of climate mitigation policies. This will, among other benefits, help to monitor progress.

 Health, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” By implication this involves a feeling of well-being that is enjoyed by individual when the body systems are functioning effectively and efficiently together and in harmony with the environment in order to achieve the objectives of good living.

Good health and well-being is the focal point for a sustainable development and prosperous society. In Nigeria, there has been a major progress in the improvement of health since 1950. Although, lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders and HIV/AIDS have ranked the topmost causes of deaths in Nigeria, in the case of other diseases such as polio, malaria and tuberculosis, progress has been achieved. Among other threats to health are malnutrition, pollution and road traffic accidents. In 2020, Nigeria had one of the highest cases of COVID-19 in Africa.

Health can be measured by indicators such as life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, under-5 child mortality (U5MR) rate, and maternal mortality rate. However, features relating to personal and inborn of individuals such as age, sex, and genetic make-up are factors that help to determine health. Other factors which affect health include socio-economic status, culture, education, indoor/outdoor environment, nutritional status, people’s own health practices and behaviours (for example the ability to identify when a family member is sick), as well as government approaches to policies and programs in its sectors, especially in the health sector.

Life expectancy and Under- 5 mortality rate 

Life expectancy at birth in Nigeria is on the increase. It increased from 49.4 in 2007 to approximately 54 in 2017. In a decade (2007 – 2017), U5MR per 1000 live births drastically reduced from 145.7 to 100.2. In comparison with some other reference countries (Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Norway, United States of America, China and Australia), as shown in the second Table below, Nigeria with a population of about 195 million has performed poorly. Also, the country has not done better when compared with the world average and the World Bank regions namely: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Maternal mortality 

Maternal mortality rate in Nigeria is above 800 per 100,000 live births. In 2013, the rate in Nigeria was 560 deaths per 100,000 live births; whereas in 1980, it was 516 deaths 100,000 per live births. This may be as a result of poor health facilities, lack of access to quality health care, malnutrition due to poverty, herder-farmer conflicts, female genital mutilations, abortions, and displacements due to Boko Haram terrorism in the North East of Nigeria. In Nigeria the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 22. Nigeria’s abortion laws make it one of the most restrictive countries regarding abortion.

A study published in 2019 investigated the competency of emergency obstetric care among health providers and found it lower than average. Another evidence-based study shows decrease in maternal mortality in the southern part of the country while it’s still on the increase in North due to low level of education.

Maternal mortality affects the socioeconomic development of the country negatively. By 2030, if Nigeria is to reduce maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births (SDG goal 3 – target 1), all hands must be on deck to achieve it. People can start by promoting and protecting their own health and the health of those around them, by making well-informed choices, practising safe sex and attending antenatal care in government approved health centres. There should be more awareness in communities about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children. Government, local leaders and other decision makers should be held accountable to their commitments to improve people’s access to health and health care.

Water supply and sanitation 

Access to an improved water source stagnated at 47% of the population from 1990 to 2006, then increased to 54% in 2010. In urban areas access decreased from 80% to 65% in 2006, and then recovered to 74% in 2010.

Adequate sanitation is typically in the form of septic tanks, liam as there is no central sewage system, except for Abuja and some areas of Lagos. A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were connected to general sewers. In 2016, mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene is 68.6 deaths per 100,000 populations.

HIV/AIDS 

Nigeria HIV/AIDS indicator and impact survey (NAIIS) 2018 revealed that the national HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 is 1.4 percent. The prevalence of HIV in Nigeria varies widely by region and states. Akwa Ibom State has the highest prevalence rate of HIV with 5.6 percent and disease burden of 200,051 percentage of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and followed by Benue State (4.9%, 188,482 DALYs) and Rivers (3.8%, 196,225 DALYs). The States, Jigawa (12,804 DALYs) and Katsina (26,597DALYs) both have the least prevalence rate of 0.3 percent. The epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high-risk behaviors, including having multiple sexual partners, low risk perceptions, inadequate access to quality health care services, as well as street/road hawking of goods by itinerant workers (hawkers) especially, around military and police checkpoints. Other risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV, including prostitution, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), clandestine high-risk homosexual/heterosexual practices, and women trafficking. Youths and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV, with young women at higher risk than young men.

Malaria 
Malaria, a disease caused by mosquitoes has resulted in untold morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Although, there has been slight decline in malarial transmission and deaths since 2007 it ranked the number one cause of deaths in the country, the disease still remain unflagging. As of 2012, the malaria prevalence rate was 11 percent. A part of this data is from the President's Malaria Initiative which identifies Nigeria as a high-burden country. Nigeria's branch dealing with this problem, the National Malaria Control Program recognized the problem and embraced the World Malaria Day theme of "End Malaria for Good".

In 2017, according to IHME ranking, malaria ranked the fourth on the causes of most deaths in Nigeria with U5MR and under-1 child mortality of 103.2 deaths and 62.6 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively. With pockets of high-level transmission persisting in states across Nigeria coupled with the never-ending struggle against drug and insecticide resistance as well as the socio-economic costs associated with a failure to eradicate the disease, malaria eradication by 2050 seems unachievable. However, the step to eradicate the disease is a bold attainable goal if concerted efforts are put in place. The challenge of ineffective management of malaria prevention and control programs and inadequate use of data to inform strategies should be addressed. The control of mosquitoes, high quality diagnosis, and treatment are very necessary if the problem is to be successfully eradicated. Strong and committed leadership at various levels of government in Nigeria, reinforced through transparency and independent accountability mechanisms are very important to ensure a complete eradication of malaria in the country.

Endemic diseases 
In 1985, an incidence of yellow fever devastated a town in Nigeria, leading to the death of 1000 people. In a span of 5 years, the epidemic grew, with a resulting rise in mortality. The yellow fever vaccine has been in existence since the 1930s. There are other endemic diseases in the country which include malaria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, and meningitis. Travelers are normally advised to get travel vaccines and medicines because of the risk of these diseases in the country.

Food
Nutrition, especially in the North of the country, is often poor. Since 2002 food staples are supposed to be fortified with nutrients such as vitamin A, folic acid, zinc, iodine and iron. Bill Gates, said there had been “pushback” by some in Nigerian industry as this reduced profit margins. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is donating $5m over four years to implement a rigorous testing regime to make sure these standards are met.  These nutrients would reach poorer children who ate mainly a cereal and beans diet at very low cost and reduce the risk of stunting.  Vitamin A would reduce the risk of death from measles or diarrhoea. In some districts 7% of children die before they reach the age of five.  Nearly half of these are attributable to malnutrition. Aliko Dangote, whose companies supply salt, sugar and flour, said there would need to be a crack down on the import of low-quality foodstuff, often smuggled into local markets.

Pollution 
Traffic congestion in Lagos, environmental pollution:water pollution, and air pollution; and noise pollution are major health issues.

Water pollution

The aquatic systems in Nigeria, no doubt, are reservoirs for toxic chemicals and dead-ends for different kinds of chemical compounds and their products. The activities of oil and gas industries as well as widespread discharge of effluents into water ways is an eyesore. Chemical substances such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as well as heavy metals from point (see point pollution) and non-point (see nonpoint pollution) sources finds their way into oceans, rivers and streams and contaminates it. In 2018, The Nation newspaper reported improper waste disposal in the country, emphasizing that there is no proper waste management system, hence the cause of the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, used polythene bags, plastic bottles and other liquid and solid wastes in the environment. The Huffingtonpost in May 2017 raised an alarm on the incessant dumping of plastics in the ocean. It posited that 'the oceans are drowning in plastics – and no one is paying attention to the menace'; and by indication, it seems people are overwhelmed by their own waste. Amidst this, Ellen MacArthur Foundation in Partnership with the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh fish. With expected surge in consumption, negative externalities related to plastics will multiply by that time. Most wastes materials contain estrogenic chemicals -  (estrogens) and androgenic chemicals - (androgens) and they have potential to leach into the surrounding environment, impact on the ecosystem and may alter hormonal functions. These contaminants and many other chemicals are toxic to aquatic lives, most often affecting their life spans and ability to reproduce; they make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey and bioaccumulate in the adipose tissues of these organisms.

Air pollution

Nigeria air quality is said to be among the most unsafe globally (ranked 4th) and four of its major cities – Onitsha, Aba, Kaduna, and Umuahia are among the worst polluted cities in the world in term of particulate matter of size 10micrometer and below (PM10) and the most recent report by WHO indicate that the country’s annual mean concentration PM2.5 is 72ug/m3 far exceeding the recommended maximum of 10ug/m3. l Data from the institutes of Health Metrics and Evaluation on Global disease burden (GBD) was used to ascertain the cause of death and DALYs in Nigeria from 2007 – 2017 and published literature where reviewed. According to World Health data report, most of the highest ranked causes of DALYs are related to environmental risk factors including chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disease, which has cause about 800 thousand death and 26million DALYs per year in Nigeria. Major environmental risk include indoor air pollution, ambient air pollution, water , sanitation and hygiene, although there is prolong and progressive decline in these except ambient PM and ground ozone pollution which show a steady rise associated with death and DALYs in Nigeria indicating a significant concern in environment health situation.

What then is the cause?

The etiology of Nigeria air pollution is a complex story and ranges from activities of people to disaster both man-made and natural causes
Firstly, Nigeria is “home” to a lot of automobiles including car, motorbikes, heavy duty vehicles like bus, lorries etc that are old and has past their best days in term of energy efficiency thus, they emit a lot of unhealthy fumes including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon dioxides, carbon monoxides, particulate matter etc.

Other major sources including emission from factories and industries which release similar fumes like automobiles but uses mainly diesel in lieu of gasoline

Life expectancy and Under- 5 mortality rate 

Life expectancy at birth in Nigeria is on the increase. It increased from 49.4 in 2007 to approximately 54 in 2017. In a decade (2007 – 2017), U5MR per 1000 live births drastically reduced from 145.7 to 100.2. In comparison with some other reference countries (Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Norway, United States of America, China and Australia), as shown in the second Table below, Nigeria with a population of about 195 million has performed poorly. Also, the country has not done better when compared with the world average and the World Bank regions namely: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Maternal mortality 

Maternal mortality rate in Nigeria is above 800 per 100,000 live births. In 2013, the rate in Nigeria was 560 deaths per 100,000 live births; whereas in 1980, it was 516 deaths 100,000 per live births. This may be as a result of poor health facilities, lack of access to quality health care, malnutrition due to poverty, herder-farmer conflicts, female genital mutilations, abortions, and displacements due to Boko Haram terrorism in the North East of Nigeria. In Nigeria the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 22. Nigeria’s abortion laws make it one of the most restrictive countries regarding abortion.

A study published in 2019 investigated the competency of emergency obstetric care among health providers and found it lower than average. Another evidence-based study shows decrease in maternal mortality in the southern part of the country while it’s still on the increase in North due to low level of education.

Maternal mortality affects the socioeconomic development of the country negatively. By 2030, if Nigeria is to reduce maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births (SDG goal 3 – target 1), all hands must be on deck to achieve it. People can start by promoting and protecting their own health and the health of those around them, by making well-informed choices, practising safe sex and attending antenatal care in government approved health centres. There should be more awareness in communities about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children. Government, local leaders and other decision makers should be held accountable to their commitments to improve people’s access to health and health care.

Water supply and sanitation 

Access to an improved water source stagnated at 47% of the population from 1990 to 2006, then increased to 54% in 2010. In urban areas access decreased from 80% to 65% in 2006, and then recovered to 74% in 2010.

Adequate sanitation is typically in the form of septic tanks, liam as there is no central sewage system, except for Abuja and some areas of Lagos. A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were connected to general sewers. In 2016, mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene is 68.6 deaths per 100,000 populations.

HIV/AIDS 

Nigeria HIV/AIDS indicator and impact survey (NAIIS) 2018 revealed that the national HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 is 1.4 percent. The prevalence of HIV in Nigeria varies widely by region and states. Akwa Ibom State has the highest prevalence rate of HIV with 5.6 percent and disease burden of 200,051 percentage of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and followed by Benue State (4.9%, 188,482 DALYs) and Rivers (3.8%, 196,225 DALYs). The States, Jigawa (12,804 DALYs) and Katsina (26,597DALYs) both have the least prevalence rate of 0.3 percent. The epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high-risk behaviors, including having multiple sexual partners, low risk perceptions, inadequate access to quality health care services, as well as street/road hawking of goods by itinerant workers (hawkers) especially, around military and police checkpoints. Other risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV, including prostitution, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), clandestine high-risk homosexual/heterosexual practices, and women trafficking. Youths and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV, with young women at higher risk than young men.

Malaria 
Malaria, a disease caused by mosquitoes has resulted in untold morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Although, there has been slight decline in malarial transmission and deaths since 2007 it ranked the number one cause of deaths in the country, the disease still remain unflagging. As of 2012, the malaria prevalence rate was 11 percent. A part of this data is from the President's Malaria Initiative which identifies Nigeria as a high-burden country. Nigeria's branch dealing with this problem, the National Malaria Control Program recognized the problem and embraced the World Malaria Day theme of "End Malaria for Good".

In 2017, according to IHME ranking, malaria ranked the fourth on the causes of most deaths in Nigeria with U5MR and under-1 child mortality of 103.2 deaths and 62.6 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively. With pockets of high-level transmission persisting in states across Nigeria coupled with the never-ending struggle against drug and insecticide resistance as well as the socio-economic costs associated with a failure to eradicate the disease, malaria eradication by 2050 seems unachievable. However, the step to eradicate the disease is a bold attainable goal if concerted efforts are put in place. The challenge of ineffective management of malaria prevention and control programs and inadequate use of data to inform strategies should be addressed. The control of mosquitoes, high quality diagnosis, and treatment are very necessary if the problem is to be successfully eradicated. Strong and committed leadership at various levels of government in Nigeria, reinforced through transparency and independent accountability mechanisms are very important to ensure a complete eradication of malaria in the country.

Endemic diseases 
In 1985, an incidence of yellow fever devastated a town in Nigeria, leading to the death of 1000 people. In a span of 5 years, the epidemic grew, with a resulting rise in mortality. The yellow fever vaccine has been in existence since the 1930s. There are other endemic diseases in the country which include malaria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, and meningitis. Travelers are normally advised to get travel vaccines and medicines because of the risk of these diseases in the country.

Food
Nutrition, especially in the North of the country, is often poor. Since 2002 food staples are supposed to be fortified with nutrients such as vitamin A, folic acid, zinc, iodine and iron. Bill Gates, said there had been “pushback” by some in Nigerian industry as this reduced profit margins. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is donating $5m over four years to implement a rigorous testing regime to make sure these standards are met.  These nutrients would reach poorer children who ate mainly a cereal and beans diet at very low cost and reduce the risk of stunting.  Vitamin A would reduce the risk of death from measles or diarrhoea. In some districts 7% of children die before they reach the age of five.  Nearly half of these are attributable to malnutrition. Aliko Dangote, whose companies supply salt, sugar and flour, said there would need to be a crack down on the import of low-quality foodstuff, often smuggled into local markets.

Pollution 
Traffic congestion in Lagos, environmental pollution:water pollution, and air pollution; and noise pollution are major health issues.

Water pollution

The aquatic systems in Nigeria, no doubt, are reservoirs for toxic chemicals and dead-ends for different kinds of chemical compounds and their products. The activities of oil and gas industries as well as widespread discharge of effluents into water ways is an eyesore. Chemical substances such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as well as heavy metals from point (see point pollution) and non-point (see nonpoint pollution) sources finds their way into oceans, rivers and streams and contaminates it. In 2018, The Nation newspaper reported improper waste disposal in the country, emphasizing that there is no proper waste management system, hence the cause of the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, used polythene bags, plastic bottles and other liquid and solid wastes in the environment. The Huffingtonpost in May 2017 raised an alarm on the incessant dumping of plastics in the ocean. It posited that 'the oceans are drowning in plastics – and no one is paying attention to the menace'; and by indication, it seems people are overwhelmed by their own waste. Amidst this, Ellen MacArthur Foundation in Partnership with the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh fish. With expected surge in consumption, negative externalities related to plastics will multiply by that time. Most wastes materials contain estrogenic chemicals -  (estrogens) and androgenic chemicals - (androgens) and they have potential to leach into the surrounding environment, impact on the ecosystem and may alter hormonal functions. These contaminants and many other chemicals are toxic to aquatic lives, most often affecting their life spans and ability to reproduce; they make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey and bioaccumulate in the adipose tissues of these organisms.

Air pollution

Nigeria air quality is said to be among the most unsafe globally (ranked 4th) and four of its major cities – Onitsha, Aba, Kaduna, and Umuahia are among the worst polluted cities in the world in term of particulate matter of size 10micrometer and below (PM10) and the most recent report by WHO indicate that the country’s annual mean concentration PM2.5 is 72ug/m3 far exceeding the recommended maximum of 10ug/m3. l Data from the institutes of Health Metrics and Evaluation on Global disease burden (GBD) was used to ascertain the cause of death and DALYs in Nigeria from 2007 – 2017 and published literature where reviewed. According to World Health data report, most of the highest ranked causes of DALYs are related to environmental risk factors including chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disease, which has cause about 800 thousand death and 26million DALYs per year in Nigeria. Major environmental risk include indoor air pollution, ambient air pollution, water , sanitation and hygiene, although there is prolong and progressive decline in these except ambient PM and ground ozone pollution which show a steady rise associated with death and DALYs in Nigeria indicating a significant concern in environment health situation.

What then is the cause?

The etiology of Nigeria air pollution is a complex story and ranges from activities of people to disaster both man-made and natural causes
Firstly, Nigeria is “home” to a lot of automobiles including car, motorbikes, heavy duty vehicles like bus, lorries etc that are old and has past their best days in term of energy efficiency thus, they emit a lot of unhealthy fumes including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon dioxides, carbon monoxides, particulate matter etc.
Secondly, large amount of waste across the country including household and industrial are disposed by combustion which releases fumes from both organic items, synthetic material like plastic, rubber as well as from dangerous items like batteries and e-waste etc
Most household also contributes thirdly to emission of noxious smokes and particulate matters like carbon soot etc as they rely on inefficient kerosene stoves, fire wood and charcoal for cooking and most time this is done indoor with poor ventilation.
Many offices and residences contributes to increased pollution level of the air with noxious fumes from generators which are used as substitute to the public epileptic power supply and these fumes are often released in largely unventilated areas. 
Other major sources including emission from factories and industries which release similar fumes like automobiles but uses mainly diesel in lieu of gasoline

Road traffic accidents 
Every year the lives of approximately 1.25 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years.

Over 3 400 people die on the world's roads every day and tens of millions of people are injured or disabled every year. Children, pedestrians, cyclists and older people are among the most vulnerable of road users. WHO works with partners - governmental and nongovernmental - around the world to raise the profile of the preventability of road traffic injuries and promote good practice related to addressing key behaviour risk factors – speed, drink-driving, the use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints.

With the continued dangerous trend of road traffic collision in Nigeria, which in 2013 placed it as one of the most road traffic accident (RTA) prone countries worldwide (the most in Africa), the Nigerian government saw the need to establish the present Federal Road Safety Corps in 1988 to address the carnage on the highways.

Level and trend of road traffic accidents
The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 456 people died and 3404 others were injured in 826 accidents recorded nationwide in January (2018).

The FRSC stated this in its CCC report for January signed by its Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi.

Causes of road traffic accidents 
The causes of road traffic accidents depend on a list of factors which can be broadly divided into:
(i). Vehicle operator or driver factors
(ii). Vehicle factors
(iii). Road pavement condition factors
(iv). Environmental factors.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals 
In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. 
The Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
The Target 3.6 under goal 3 is designed specifically to addresses the issue of road traffic accident: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has put some mechanisms in place to ensure implementation of the SDGs in the country however, Nigeria is still far from achieving this goal.

Traditional/Alternative medicine
As recent reports have shown, in addition to the many benefits there are also risks associated with the different types of Traditional Medicine / Complementary or alternative Medicine. Although consumers today have widespread access to various TM/CAM treatments and therapies, they often do not have enough information on what to check when using TM/CAM in order to avoid unnecessary harm. While traditional medicine has a lot to contribute to the health and economy, much harm has resulted from unregulated sale and misuse of traditional/alternative medicine and herbs in the country and has significantly delayed patients' seeking professional healthcare.

Potential Impact of Climate Change on Health in Nigeria

In recent times, more attention has been drawn to the effects of climate change around the world. A lot of unprecedented changes are being recorded in the weather conditions of different regions and countries. These have manifested in form of wildfires, torrential rains and other extreme weather outcomes. It has been pointed out that the health effects of climate change will increase dramatically over the next few years and pose a risk to human life and the well-being of billions of people.

With around 200 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa. As the continent’s main exporter of oil, Nigeria faces the challenge of balancing global energy demands and domestic economic stability with the need to address climate and environmental challenges. The impact of climate change in Nigeria could include rising temperatures, more intense and frequent extreme weather events and sea level rise. For the population, this could result in increased water and food insecurity, higher exposure to heat stress and ultraviolet radiation; changes in infectious and vector-borne disease transmission patterns; and an increased threat to coastal communities facing sea level rise. It is however important to add that adequate adaptation and mitigation could help to protect the population, presenting opportunities for actions towards better health outcomes even in the face of numerous challenges posed by climate change. 

The greatest health risk is for illness to result in mortality. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate prevalent diseases as well as emerging ones like High blood pressure, psychosis, neurosis and congenital malformations. Climate change creates overwhelming problems for an already impoverished populace.

Flooding is a consequence of climate change from rise in see level and poor infrastructure, especially with drainage systems planning and design. For instance, southern Nigeria is highly susceptible to flooding; particularly Lagos, the commercial hub of the country, which is said to be one meter above the sea level, is threatened with possible extinction. The direct health implications of flooding could be deduced to include direct water borne diseases like typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria. These, as we will see in the table below are diseases that already immensely burden the Nigerian populace.

Furthermore, The WHO has identified Schistosomiasis, African Trypanosomiasis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and leishmaniasis as “major tropical diseases”. This is in consideration of their public health significance and economic consequences on afflicted individuals, families and societies. The devastating effects of these diseases are summarized in the words of Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, former Director General, WHO: “beyond their toll of individual illness and death, these tropical diseases have insidious effects on society. They impede on national and individual development, make fertile land inhospitable, impair intellectual and physical growth and exact a huge cost in terms of treatment and control”. 

Meningitis, measles, chicken pox and other health risks like high blood pressure and dehydration in pregnancy are also believed to be amplified by high temperatures. The number of people in emerging countries is expected to increase by 2.3 billion in 2005 to 4 billion in 2030. This means more carbon emotions due to human activities. Growing urban sprawls, including poor housing also further compounds the problem. These changes inevitably increase the peril heat waves in the cities due to the effects of Climate change.

Additionally, high temperature affects diseases spread and rates of transmission of vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases. Temperature affects pathogen maturation rate and mosquito replication, the insect’s density in a specific area, and increases infection likelihood. Malaria parasites are recognized to remain sensitive to temperature, particularly throughout the so-called extrinsic period of incubation for parasite lifecycle, which happens once the parasite remains alive in the mosquitos. For example, warmer temperatures promote faster reproductive cycles in mosquitoes that transit malaria and in the parasite itself.

Although Nigeria has identified with the rest of the world in acknowledging climate change and its potential impacts for health and wellbeing, there are still gaps in the planning and implementation of actions to mitigate these effects. The WHO- Climate and Health Country Profile for Nigeria (2015), highlights the successes and shortcomings that characterize the country’s climate change response. These include: identifying a national focal point for climate change in the Ministry of Health and the development of a national health adaptation strategy. However, no actions have been implemented towards building institutional and technical capacities to work on climate change and health. Also, Nigeria has climate information included in its Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, including development of early warning and response systems for climate-sensitive health risks. Albeit, no activities have been implanted to increase resilience of health infrastructure. Finally, it is important to note that no financial commitments (both domestic and international funds) have been made to implements any action towards health resilience to climate change. 

These gaps present opportunities for actions, the implementation of which has potential to better prepare Nigeria as a country to mitigate the health risks that climate change poses to its people. The WHO suggests a comprehensive vulnerability and adaptation assessment with a focus on health that includes relevant stakeholders from all sectors and an estimate of the costs to implement health resilience to climate change, covering infrastructure as well as institutional and technical capacities. Furthermore, actions need to be taken, that will ensure greening of the health sector, such as promoting the use of renewable energy, and finally, conducting a valuation of the co-benefits to health of climate mitigation policies. This will, among other benefits, help to monitor progress.

 Health, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” By implication this involves a feeling of well-being that is enjoyed by individual when the body systems are functioning effectively and efficiently together and in harmony with the environment in order to achieve the objectives of good living.

Good health and well-being is the focal point for a sustainable development and prosperous society. In Nigeria, there has been a major progress in the improvement of health since 1950. Although, lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders and HIV/AIDS have ranked the topmost causes of deaths in Nigeria, in the case of other diseases such as polio, malaria and tuberculosis, progress has been achieved. Among other threats to health are malnutrition, pollution and road traffic accidents. In 2020, Nigeria had one of the highest cases of COVID-19 in Africa.

Health can be measured by indicators such as life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, under-5 child mortality (U5MR) rate, and maternal mortality rate. However, features relating to personal and inborn of individuals such as age, sex, and genetic make-up are factors that help to determine health. Other factors which affect health include socio-economic status, culture, education, indoor/outdoor environment, nutritional status, people’s own health practices and behaviours (for example the ability to identify when a family member is sick), as well as government approaches to policies and programs in its sectors, especially in the health sector.

Life expectancy and Under- 5 mortality rate 

Life expectancy at birth in Nigeria is on the increase. It increased from 49.4 in 2007 to approximately 54 in 2017. In a decade (2007 – 2017), U5MR per 1000 live births drastically reduced from 145.7 to 100.2. In comparison with some other reference countries (Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Norway, United States of America, China and Australia), as shown in the second Table below, Nigeria with a population of about 195 million has performed poorly. Also, the country has not done better when compared with the world average and the World Bank regions namely: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Maternal mortality 

Maternal mortality rate in Nigeria is above 800 per 100,000 live births. In 2013, the rate in Nigeria was 560 deaths per 100,000 live births; whereas in 1980, it was 516 deaths 100,000 per live births. This may be as a result of poor health facilities, lack of access to quality health care, malnutrition due to poverty, herder-farmer conflicts, female genital mutilations, abortions, and displacements due to Boko Haram terrorism in the North East of Nigeria. In Nigeria the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 22. Nigeria’s abortion laws make it one of the most restrictive countries regarding abortion.

Another evidence-based study shows decrease in maternal mortality in the southern part of the country while it’s still on the increase in North due to low level of education.

Maternal mortality affects the socioeconomic development of the country negatively. By 2030, if Nigeria is to reduce maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births (SDG goal 3 – target 1), all hands must be on deck to achieve it. People can start by promoting and protecting their own health and the health of those around them, by making well-informed choices, practising safe sex and attending antenatal care in government approved health centres. There should be more awareness in communities about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.

Other major sources including emission from factories and industries which release similar fumes like automobiles but uses mainly diesel in lieu of gasoline

Road traffic accidents 
Every year the lives of approximately 1.25 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years.

Over 3 400 people die on the world's roads every day and tens of millions of people are injured or disabled every year. Children, pedestrians, cyclists and older people are among the most vulnerable of road users. WHO works with partners - governmental and nongovernmental - around the world to raise the profile of the preventability of road traffic injuries and promote good practice related to addressing key behaviour risk factors – speed, drink-driving, the use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints.

With the continued dangerous trend of road traffic collision in Nigeria, which in 2013 placed it as one of the most road traffic accident (RTA) prone countries worldwide (the most in Africa), the Nigerian government saw the need to establish the present Federal Road Safety Corps in 1988 to address the carnage on the highways.

Level and trend of road traffic accidents
The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 456 people died and 3404 others were injured in 826 accidents recorded nationwide in January (2018).

The FRSC stated this in its CCC report for January signed by its Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi.

Causes of road traffic accidents 
The causes of road traffic accidents depend on a list of factors which can be broadly divided into:
(i). Vehicle operator or driver factors
(ii). Vehicle factors
(iii). Road pavement condition factors
(iv). Environmental factors.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals 
In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. 
The Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
The Target 3.6 under goal 3 is designed specifically to addresses the issue of road traffic accident: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has put some mechanisms in place to ensure implementation of the SDGs in the country however, Nigeria is still far from achieving this goal.

Traditional/Alternative medicine
As recent reports have shown, in addition to the many benefits there are also risks associated with the different types of Traditional Medicine / Complementary or alternative Medicine. Although consumers today have widespread access to various TM/CAM treatments and therapies, they often do not have enough information on what to check when using TM/CAM in order to avoid unnecessary harm. While traditional medicine has a lot to contribute to the health and economy, much harm has resulted from unregulated sale and misuse of traditional/alternative medicine and herbs in the country and has significantly delayed patients' seeking professional healthcare.

Potential Impact of Climate Change on Health in Nigeria

In recent times, more attention has been drawn to the effects of climate change around the world. A lot of unprecedented changes are being recorded in the weather conditions of different regions and countries. These have manifested in form of wildfires, torrential rains and other extreme weather outcomes. It has been pointed out that the health effects of climate change will increase dramatically over the next few years and pose a risk to human life and the well-being of billions of people.

With around 200 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa. As the continent’s main exporter of oil, Nigeria faces the challenge of balancing global energy demands and domestic economic stability with the need to address climate and environmental challenges. The impact of climate change in Nigeria could include rising temperatures, more intense and frequent extreme weather events and sea level rise. For the population, this could result in increased water and food insecurity, higher exposure to heat stress and ultraviolet radiation; changes in infectious and vector-borne disease transmission patterns; and an increased threat to coastal communities facing sea level rise. It is however important to add that adequate adaptation and mitigation could help to protect the population, presenting opportunities for actions towards better health outcomes even in the face of numerous challenges posed by climate change. 

The greatest health risk is for illness to result in mortality. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate prevalent diseases as well as emerging ones like High blood pressure, psychosis, neurosis and congenital malformations. Climate change creates overwhelming problems for an already impoverished populace.

Flooding is a consequence of climate change from rise in see level and poor infrastructure, especially with drainage systems planning and design. For instance, southern Nigeria is highly susceptible to flooding; particularly Lagos, the commercial hub of the country, which is said to be one meter above the sea level, is threatened with possible extinction. The direct health implications of flooding could be deduced to include direct water borne diseases like typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria. These, as we will see in the table below are diseases that already immensely burden the Nigerian populace.

Furthermore, The WHO has identified Schistosomiasis, African Trypanosomiasis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and leishmaniasis as “major tropical diseases”. This is in consideration of their public health significance and economic consequences on afflicted individuals, families and societies. The devastating effects of these diseases are summarized in the words of Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, former Director General, WHO: “beyond their toll of individual illness and death, these tropical diseases have insidious effects on society. They impede on national and individual development, make fertile land inhospitable, impair intellectual and physical growth and exact a huge cost in terms of treatment and control”. 

Meningitis, measles, chicken pox and other health risks like high blood pressure and dehydration in pregnancy are also believed to be amplified by high temperatures. The number of people in emerging countries is expected to increase by 2.3 billion in 2005 to 4 billion in 2030. This means more carbon emotions due to human activities. Growing urban sprawls, including poor housing also further compounds the problem. These changes inevitably increase the peril heat waves in the cities due to the effects of Climate change.

Additionally, high temperature affects diseases spread and rates of transmission of vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases. Temperature affects pathogen maturation rate and mosquito replication, the insect’s density in a specific area, and increases infection likelihood. Malaria parasites are recognized to remain sensitive to temperature, particularly throughout the so-called extrinsic period of incubation for parasite lifecycle, which happens once the parasite remains alive in the mosquitos. For example, warmer temperatures promote faster reproductive cycles in mosquitoes that transit malaria and in the parasite itself.

Although Nigeria has identified with the rest of the world in acknowledging climate change and its potential impacts for health and wellbeing, there are still gaps in the planning and implementation of actions to mitigate these effects. The WHO- Climate and Health Country Profile for Nigeria (2015), highlights the successes and shortcomings that characterize the country’s climate change response. These include: identifying a national focal point for climate change in the Ministry of Health and the development of a national health adaptation strategy. However, no actions have been implemented towards building institutional and technical capacities to work on climate change and health. Also, Nigeria has climate information included in its Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, including development of early warning and response systems for climate-sensitive health risks. Albeit, no activities have been implanted to increase resilience of health infrastructure. Finally, it is important to note that no financial commitments (both domestic and international funds) have been made to implements any action towards health resilience to climate change. 

These gaps present opportunities for actions, the implementation of which has potential to better prepare Nigeria as a country to mitigate the health risks that climate change poses to its people. The WHO suggests a comprehensive vulnerability and adaptation assessment with a focus on health that includes relevant stakeholders from all sectors and an estimate of the costs to implement health resilience to climate change, covering infrastructure as well as institutional and technical capacities. Furthermore, actions need to be taken, that will ensure greening of the health sector, such as promoting the use of renewable energy, and finally, conducting a valuation of the co-benefits to health of climate mitigation policies. This will, among other benefits, help to monitor progress.

['In the case of a lightning strike, water can act as an electrical conductor. When lightning strikes a body of water, such as a lake or ocean, the water conducts the electrical current, allowing the lightning to travel through the water and potentially harm any living organisms in its path. This is why it is dangerous to be in or near water during a thunderstorm.\n\nIn terms of human experience, grabbing a fence or any other metal object during a thunderstorm can also result in being shocked due to the electrical current being conducted through the metal and into the body. This is because metal is a good conductor of electricity, and can easily carry the electrical current from the lightning strike to the human body.\n\nIn contrast, standing in a puddle or on dry land during a thunderstorm is less likely to result in being struck by lightning due to the lack of conductivity in these materials. However, it is still important to avoid being in open fields or on tall objects during a thunderstorm, as these can act as lightning rods and increase the risk of being struck.\n\nOverall, water and metal are both examples of materials that can act as electrical conductors, and can pose a significant risk during a thunderstorm.

  of rise of the fault current. A short circuit may lead to formation of an electric arc. The arc, a channel of hot ionized plasma, is highly conductive and can persist even after significant amounts of original material from the conductors has evaporated. Surface erosion is a typical sign of electric arc damage. Even short arcs can remove significant amounts of material from the electrodes. The temperature of the resulting electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current, as well as to escape into the air as fine particulate matter.

Wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures, buildings, crops, and provide risks to explosions, should the flames be exposed to gas pipes. Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion. In areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning, like Florida, lightning causes several fatalities per year, most commonly to people working outside. Precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels (pH), otherwise known as acid rain, is also a frequent risk produced by lightning. Distilled water, which contains no carbon

  other, possibly causing deformity. Electrical burns can be caused by a variety of ways such as touching or grasping electrically live objects, short-circuiting, inserting fingers into electrical sockets, and falling into electrified water. Lightning strikes are also a cause of electrical burns, but this is a less common event. With the advances in technology, electrical injuries are becoming more common and are the fourth leading cause of work-related traumatic death. One third of all electrical traumas and most high-voltage injuries are job related, and more than 50% of these injuries result from power line contact. Electrical burns can be classified into six categories, and any combination of these categories may be present on an electrical burn victim:

The storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding locales. Cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.

  High-level EMP signals can pose a threat to human safety. In such circumstances, direct contact with a live electrical conductor should be avoided. Where this occurs, such as when touching a Van de Graaff generator or other highly-charged object, care must be taken to release the object and then discharge the body through a high resistance, in order to avoid the risk of a harmful shock pulse when stepping away. Very high electric field strengths can cause breakdown of the air and a potentially lethal arc current similar to lightning to flow, but electric field strengths of up to 200 kV/m are regarded as safe. According to research from Edd Gent, a 2019 report by the Electric Power Research Institute, which is funded by utility companies, found that such

 The different categories of lightning strikes that can cause injury to humans are direct strikes, side splash, contact injury, and ground current. 

A direct strike occurs when a person is directly hit by lightning. This type of strike exposes the individual to the full force of the lightning bolt and can cause severe injuries.

Orifice entry is another category that may occur if a lightning strike happens near the head. In this case, the lightning enters through the eyes, ears, or mouth and flows internally within the body.

Side splash refers to a situation where lightning jumps from its primary strike location to a nearby person. This can happen when someone is in close proximity to where the initial strike occurred.

Contact injury occurs when a person is touching an object on the pathway of the lightning. The electrical current from the lightning can travel through objects such as trees or metal structures and cause harm to anyone in contact with them.

Ground current is another category where lightning strikes nearby and the electrical current travels through the ground towards a person. This type of strike can be dangerous for individuals standing on or near conductive surfaces like wet soil or bodies of water.

It's important to note that aside from these electrical mechanisms, secondary blunt trauma can also occur as a result of a lightning strike. This means that individuals may experience injuries due to being thrown or knocked down by the force of the strike itself.

Overall, it's crucial to take precautions during thunderstorms to minimize your risk of being struck by lightning and suffering injuries.

  injury to other organs. For a burn to be classified as electrical, electricity must be the direct cause. For example, burning a finger on a hot electric steam iron would be thermal, not electrical. According to Joule's first law: electricity passing through resistance creates heat, so there is no current entering the body in this type of burn. Likewise, a fire that is ruled to be "electrical" in origin, does not necessarily mean that any injuries or deaths are due to electrical burns. Unless someone was injured at the exact moment that the fire began, it is unlikely that any electrical burns would occur.

1. Teach your child to avoid open water, tall trees, high ground, or metal objects (e.g., a shovel) during thunderstorms. This is important as being near these objects can increase the risk of being struck by lightning.

2. Ensure that your child does not touch electrical appliances, such as a hair dryer or radio, while in a bathtub. Water can conduct electricity, and contact with electricity in water can cause severe electric shock.

3. Cover all electrical outlets with plastic safety caps to prevent children from inserting objects into them. This helps to reduce the risk of electric shock.

4. Unplug appliances, such as hair dryers and curling irons, when they are not in use. This eliminates the risk of accidental contact with electrical currents.

5. Keep electrical cords away from toddlers who might chew on them. Children may not understand the dangers associated with chewing on electrical cords, which can lead to electric shock or burns.

6. Teach your child not to turn on lights or electrical appliances while standing on a wet floor or wet ground. Wet surfaces can conduct electricity and increase the risk of electric shock.

By following these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of electric shock or lightning injury in children.

 2 -10.62716 The different categories of lightning strikes that can cause injury to humans are direct strikes, side splash, contact injury, and ground current. 

A direct strike occurs when a person is directly hit by lightning. This type of strike exposes the individual to the full force of the lightning bolt and can cause severe injuries.

Orifice entry is another category that may occur if a lightning strike happens near the head. In this case, the lightning enters through the eyes, ears, or mouth and flows internally within the body.

Side splash refers to a situation where lightning jumps from its primary strike location to a nearby person. This can happen when someone is in close proximity to where the initial strike occurred.

Contact injury occurs when a person is touching an object on the pathway of the lightning. The electrical current from the lightning can travel through objects such as trees or metal structures and cause harm to anyone in contact with them.

Ground current is another category where lightning strikes nearby and the electrical current travels through the ground towards a person. This type of strike can be dangerous for individuals standing on or near conductive surfaces like wet soil or bodies of water.

It's important to note that aside from these electrical mechanisms, secondary blunt trauma can also occur as a result of a lightning strike. This means that individuals may experience injuries due to being thrown or knocked down by the force of the strike itself.

Overall, it's crucial to take precautions during thunderstorms to minimize your risk of being struck by lightning and suffering injuries.
 3 -10.69145  High-level EMP signals can pose a threat to human safety. In such circumstances, direct contact with a live electrical conductor should be avoided. Where this occurs, such as when touching a Van de Graaff generator or other highly-charged object, care must be taken to release the object and then discharge the body through a high resistance, in order to avoid the risk of a harmful shock pulse when stepping away. Very high electric field strengths can cause breakdown of the air and a potentially lethal arc current similar to lightning to flow, but electric field strengths of up to 200 kV/m are regarded as safe. According to research from Edd Gent, a 2019 report by the Electric Power Research Institute, which is funded by utility companies, found that such

For example, burning a finger on a hot electric steam iron would be thermal, not electrical. According to Joule's first law: electricity passing through resistance creates heat, so there is no current entering the body in this type of burn. Likewise, a fire that is ruled to be "electrical" in origin, does not necessarily mean that any injuries or deaths are due to electrical burns. Unless someone was injured at the exact moment that the fire began, it is unlikely that any electrical burns would occur.
 5 -11.03525  other, possibly causing deformity. Electrical burns can be caused by a variety of ways such as touching or grasping electrically live objects, short-circuiting, inserting fingers into electrical sockets, and falling into electrified water. Lightning strikes are also a cause of electrical burns, but this is a less common event. With the advances in technology, electrical injuries are becoming more common and are the fourth leading cause of work-related traumatic death. One third of all electrical traumas and most high-voltage injuries are job related, and more than 50% of these injuries result from power line contact. Electrical burns can be classified into six categories, and any combination of these categories may be present on an electrical burn victim:

["Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into carbohydrates. This process is essential for the survival of life on Earth, as it provides the primary source of organic matter and oxygen for the atmosphere.\n\nDuring photosynthesis, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigments called chlorophyll, which are found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. This energy is then used to power a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nThe glucose produced during photosynthesis is used by the plant as a source of energy and as a building block for the synthesis of other organic compounds. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere, where it is essential for the survival of all aerobic organisms.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a critical process for maintaining the balance of carbon and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, as it helps to remove excess carbon dioxide and replenish the supply of oxygen.

In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the Calvin-Benson cycle) is a light-independent reaction that converts carbon dioxide into glucose (fuel).

  Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation. Research on this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight.

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is no direct reaction that converts to a sugar because all

  Photosynthesis systems function by measuring gas exchange of leaves. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by leaves in the process of photosynthesis, where is used to generate sugars in a molecular pathway known as the Calvin cycle. This draw-down of induces more atmospheric  to diffuse through stomata into the air spaces of the leaf. While stoma are open, water vapor can easily diffuse out of plant tissues, a process known as transpiration. It is this exchange of and water vapor that is measured as a proxy of photosynthetic rate. The basic components of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), batteries and

  In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (Azolla), angiosperms (Gunnera), etc. There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).

  The evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is used to assemble sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or electrons, rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.

  Photosynthesis is not quite as simple as adding water to to produce sugars and oxygen. A complex chemical pathway is involved, facilitated along the way by a range of enzymes and co-enzymes. The enzyme RuBisCO is responsible for "fixing" – that is, it attaches it to a carbon-based molecule to form a sugar, which can be used by the plant, releasing an oxygen molecule along the way. However, the enzyme is notoriously inefficient, and just as effectively will also fix oxygen instead of in a process called photorespiration. This is energetically costly as the plant has to use energy to turn the products of photorespiration back into a form that can react with.

 Chloroplasts play a crucial role in the survival of eukaryotic cells. They are believed to have originated from symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria that were acquired by eukaryotic cells possessing mitochondria. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome and perform photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is the process by which chloroplasts use the energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. This process converts light energy into chemical energy stored in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. The carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis serve as a source of energy and organic compounds for the host eukaryotic cell.

The products of photosynthesis, including glucose and oxygen, are delivered to the host cell as food. Glucose serves as a vital energy source for cellular processes, providing the necessary fuel for various metabolic reactions. Oxygen, on the other hand, is released into the surrounding environment, supporting aerobic respiration in other organisms.

The presence of chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells, particularly in plants and algae, enables these organisms to generate their own food through photosynthesis. This ability to produce energy-rich carbohydrates gives them a significant advantage in terms of survival and growth. Furthermore, the partnership between eukaryotic cells and chloroplasts is believed to have evolved around 1.5 billion years ago when the Earth's atmosphere became rich in oxygen.

In summary, chloroplasts contribute to the survival of eukaryotic cells by performing photosynthesis, synthesizing carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight energy. The products of photosynthesis, such as glucose and oxygen, provide nourishment and energy for the host cell, enabling it to carry out essential cellular processes and ensuring the organism's survival.

  a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago. The main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.  Timeline of Photosynthesis on Earth

  Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer. UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin.It can even reduce skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours.

  A childless woman tells the Sun that if she could only have a child, the Sun could take the child when she was twelve. Then she has a daughter, Maroula or Letiko. When Maroula is twelve, a fine gentlemen meets her while she is gathering herbs and tells her to remind her mother of her promise. In Megas's variant, this happens twice; the first, the mother instructs Maroula to tell the Sun that she forgot; the second, the Sun has her put an apple in her headdress to remind her by falling out in the evening; the mother keeps her a long time, and finally sends her

 yOU DON'T have to get burned to increase the risk of skin cancer. So if you store all your sunscreen in your beach bag, do yourself a favor and get an extra tube for when you drive to the mall or walk the dog.
"The damage caused by the sun is incremental," says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., and author of Total Skin. "It accumulates over your lifetime." In other words, your risk increases one sunny (or cloudy) day at a time.
With more than a million cases each year, skin cancer accounts for a majority of all cancers in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. Most cases can be cured if detected and treated early. However, skin cancer does kill: About 10,000 people are expected to die from it in 2006.
Sunlight induces skin cancer in several ways, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. First, ultraviolet light damages DNA, leading to mutations that can contribute to cancer; second, it produces activated oxygen molecules that harm DNA and other structures in the cells; and third, it suppresses immune function around the area of the sun damage, which impedes the body's own natural defenses against cancer.
Actinic keratosis is considered the first step in the development of some skin cancers. It refers to small, scaly spots — commonly found on the face, ears, neck, lower arms, and back of the hands in fair-skinned people who have had significant sun exposure — which may become cancerous if not treated or removed. To prevent an actinic keratosis from turning into cancer, some doctors prescribe topical treatments like diclofenac (Solaraze), imiquimod (Aldara), and tretinoin (Retin-A).
Basal cell carcinoma (75 percent of cases) generally appears as raised, translucent lumps. While it usually doesn't spread to other body parts, it can be disfiguring.
Squamous cell carcinoma (20 percent) develops in the upper layer of the skin, most often in places that have been exposed to sun. It tends to manifest as raised reddish bumps or growths. Squamous cell can spread to other parts of the body; once this happens, it is more difficult to treat.
Melanoma (4 percent) is the most dangerous kind of skin cancer; it can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream and the lymph system. It also shows up in younger patients — half of all cases occur under age 57. Symptoms include irregularly shaped brown or black blemishes.
Asymmetry Skin cancers often have irregular shapes.
Border Trouble spots can be indicated by ragged and poorly defined edges or rolled borders.
Color Lesions can be very dark, multicolored, or mottled with shades of black, brown, or tan, or even white, gray, red, or blue. Basal cell may be indicated by pink growths or pale yellow or waxy scarlike areas.
Diameter Watch for spots greater than ¼ inch, about the size of a pencil eraser tip. Basal cell can show up as larger reddish patches, which may or may not crust, itch, or hurt.
Et cetera Other warning signs of skin cancer include a sore that doesn't heal or a change in how a mole feels (it begins to hurt, show tenderness, or itch) or behaves (it starts to bleed or ooze).
Staying out of the sun is by far the most effective way to prevent skin cancer. Using sunscreen is the next-best strategy, and you should never wander far from your trusty bottle of SPF 30. (The number refers to the level of sun protection factor against UVB radiation.) "Just like you brush your teeth every day, you should use sunscreen every day," advises dermatologist Joshua Fox, M.D., director of Advanced Dermatology P.C. in New York and a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology "Even on a cloudy day, up to 80 percent of the sun's rays get through."
It's worse at the beach or on the slopes. Water reflects 20 percent of the sun's rays, while sand and snow boost them by 80 percent. "It's like being hit from both sides," Fox says.
Sunscreen and sunblock are not the same. In sunscreens, chemicals like benzophenones, cinnamates, salicylates, and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a compound linked to allergic reactions in some people) prevent sun damage by chemically absorbing radiation before it reaches the skin. Pick a product that works on both UVA and UVB radiation; Leffell likes the brands Ombrelle, Sundown, Water Babies, BullFrog, and PreSun.
Sunblocks contain ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that lie on top of the skin and physically obstruct UVA and UVB radiation. "Blocks are less likely to cause allergic reactions and are sometimes called 'chemical-free,'" says Leffell. "You can't get more natural than zinc oxide." Sunblocks with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also "photo-stable," which means they do not change in the presence of light; many products combine the two agents, such as Jason Family Block, SkinCeuticals Physical UV Defense, and Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion.
Don't spend a fortune for sun protection, but choose something with an appealing texture; otherwise you'll never use it. It takes about 1 teaspoon to cover the face and neck and 1 to 3 tablespoons for the body. Apply 30 minutes before sun exposure; it's best to reapply frequently, though no SPF allows you to stay out in the sun all day.
If you run out of sunscreen, don't presume that throwing on a shirt will defend you from the sun. "The average white T-shirt has an SPF of four to six," notes Leffell.
Loosely woven garments that are light in color, thin, or stretchy (which describes most warm-weather fabrics) offer little safety. "Very fair people and those who have had skin cancer should wear broad-brimmed hats and use sun-protective clothing," Leffell advises.
Green tea has previously shown anti-carcinogenic potential. Various animal studies have found that the polyphenols in green tea (and, to a lesser extent, black tea) consumed as a beverage or applied to the skin appear to prevent skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation.
Apigenin A flavonoid found in herbs (endives, cloves), vegetables (beans, broccoli, celery, leeks, onions, barley, parsley, tomatoes), fruits (apples, cherries, grapes), and beverages (tea, wine).
Curcumin A yellow pigment that's obtained from the turmeric rhizome.
Proanthocyanidins Antioxidants found in grape seeds.
Resveratrol A compound found in grape skins, peanuts, red wine, and mulberries.
Silymarin A flavonoid extracted from the seeds of milk thistle.
"Consumption of these dietary botanicals may provide efficient protection against the effects of solar ultraviolet radiation," says Katiyar, who due to quality concerns recommends whole foods over supplements when possible. It's easy to pair green tea with meals; look to Indian cookbooks for ways to use turmeric. The suggested dose for standardized milk thistle supplements is 200 to 400 milligrams per day.
Is sun all bad? Well, it's important for the body's production of vitamin D, which maintains bone density. It might even offer protection against diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, says Boston University School of Medicine professor Michael Holick, M.D., Ph.D., author of The UV Advantage.
Holick advises people to expose their arms and legs to five to 10 minutes of sunshine between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (depending on season, skin type, and latitude) two or three days a week. This allows the body to manufacture the vitamin D it needs without increasing skin-cancer risk, he claims.
But other dermatologists disagree, especially since you can get vitamin D through supplements. Responding to Holick's suggestion, the Skin Cancer Foundation notes that unprotected sun exposures of just two or three minutes can begin breaking down skin tissues. James M. Spencer, M.D., a clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a member of the foundation's medical council, suggests protecting bone health by drinking vitamin-D-fortified juice or milk, eating fatty fish, or taking a daily multivitamin containing 600 units of vitamin D. "It's a lot safer," he says.
Fox concurs: "I think it's better to wear sunscreen every day."
The upper and lower eyelids are two of the most common places on the face that skin cancer can occur, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation; these cases can be hard to treat and account for about to percent of all skin-cancer deaths. Other than staying out of the sun, the best way to prevent skin cancer on the eyelids is to wear UV-blocking sunglasses, which can stop more than 99 percent of UVA and UVB rays from reaching the area. Wraparound sunglasses protect a wider section of skin than ordinary styles.
Other ways to guard your delicate lids include carefully applying sunscreen around the area — a sunblock stick makes this easier to do safely — and wearing a hat with a brim that is at feast 3 to 4 inches wide.
Another prime site for skin cancer is the lips (particularly the lower lip, which gets more sunlight). Protect your kisser with sun-blocking lip balms like Almay Pure Tints Protective Lip Care or C.O. Bigelow Lip Formula.
Chemotherapy Cancer-fighting drugs are applied to the skin. If the cancer hat spread, the drugs may be administered Into the bloodstream.
cells are vaporized with Intense waves of light.
Surgery Cancerous tissue is cut away; the excision is then stitched closed. Large wounds may require skin grafts from other parts of the body.
Cancer cells are scraped away with an Instrument that resembles a vegetable peeler. It may be followed by treatment with an electric needle to destroy remaining cancer cells. Both of these procedures are typically repeated a few times.
Cryosurgery Cancer cells are frozen and destroyed with liquid nitrogen.
Mohs micrographic surgery Cancerous tissue is cut or scraped away. During the procedure, the tissue is microscopically examined to determine whether more skin must be excised in order to remove the entire tumor.
Radiation High-energy rays or particles are beamed at the skin to destroy cancer cells. Up to 30 treatments may be required.
Nearly 30 million Americans visit indoor tanning salons each year, and many of them believe what they're doing carries no danger. Not true. "Indoor tanning is simply not safe," says James M. Spencer, M.D., a board member of the Skin Cancer Foundation.
In a large-scale Scandinavian study, tanning-bed use was associated with a 55 percent increase in melanoma risk, especially in participants between the ages of 20 and 29.
"We know that tanning-parlor radiation definitely causes skin cancer," says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine. "Those are the same lightbulbs we use in the lab to cause skin cancer."
Since the damaging effects accumulate over time, indoor tanning is particularly dangerous during the teenage years. "In my experience, any woman in her 20s who has a skin cancer most likely says she used tanning parlors," Leffell reports.
PHOTO (COLOR): SUN DAMAGE is quick and cumulative. But protective strategies can keep those cancerous rays at bay.

 Oral Sunblock – Is It Really Necessary?
Most people attribute the negative consequence of being under the sun to merely just sunburn, an effect which is apparent almost immediately following sun exposure. Unbeknown to many, excessive sunlight exposure also leaves a more permanent effect- premature skin aging.
Sunlight that reaches our skin consists of two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays: ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB). The wavelengths of these rays are shorter than visible light, making them invisible to the naked eye.
UVA has a longer wavelength as compared to UVB. It penetrates deeper into the skin (the dermis layer) and exerts photo-aging effects over time, leading to loss of skin elasticity, sun spots, wrinkling, sagging and accentuated skin furrows. On the other hand, UVB which has a relatively shorter wavelength damages the superficial layer of the skin (the epidermis layer) resulting in sunburn, turning your skin lobster red. Both these UV rays share a common terrifying effect, where overexposure increases the risk of genetic mutation, subsequently leading to skin cancer.
Hiding yourself indoors is by no means a solution to this problem as UVA rays can still penetrate through a glass window. Moreover, appropriate exposure to sunlight is known to be beneficial as it provides us with the sunshine vitamin. UVB rays are required by our body to make Vitamin D which plays many important bodily functions such as maintenance of bone health, cognitive abilities and psychological wellbeing. Bearing these in mind, it is important to strive for balanced sun exposure obtaining its benefits but not exposing one to the undesirable effects of sunlight. With sufficient protection from the harmful rays, one can can still go about in the day under the sun.
When we think about sun protection, the first thing that comes to mind naturally would be topical sunscreen. While these sunscreens have been proven to be beneficial, they do have their limitations, such as the greasy white unnatural finish on the skin and the hassle of re-application. Furthermore, these sunscreens are only limited to the areas of skin that it is applied on. This is where oral sunblock has a pivotal role. It can complement the use of topical sunscreen, creating an additive benefit on top of what can be gained from using topical sunscreen alone. Merely taking a pill will provide head to toe skin protection from the sun. Our product Skin ProteXTM is a simple, quick and easy oral sunblock in providing a wholesome inside-out approach to sun protection.

Because of the ultraviolet radiation it emits, the sun is inherently dangerous to human skin. In fact, the American Academy of Dermatology stipulates that there is no safe way to tan. Tanning is the skin's natural response to damage from the sun. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency proclaims that everybody, regardless of race or ethnicity, is subject to the potential adverse effects of overexposure to the sun. That's why everyone needs to protect their skin from the sun every day.
When ultraviolet light penetrates the epidermis it stimulates melanin, the substance responsible for skin pigmentation. Up to a point, the melanin absorbs dangerous UV rays before they do serious damage. Melanin increases in response to sun exposure, which is what causes the skin to tan. This is a sign of skin damage, not health. Sunburns develop when the UV exposure is greater than the skin's natural ability to protect against it.
The sun emits two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays that are harmful to human skin. UVA rays penetrate deep into the dermis and lead to wrinkles, age spots and skin cancers. UVB rays are responsible for causing sunburn, cataracts and immune system damage. Melanoma is thought to be associated with severe UVB sunburns that occur before the age of 20.
Sunscreens absorb ultraviolet light so that it doesn't reach the skin. Look for sunscreens with the active ingredients PABA, benzophenones, cinnamates or salicylates. Sunblocks literally block the UV rays instead of absorbing them. Key active ingredients for sunblock success are titanium oxide and zinc oxide.
There is no sunscreen or sunblock that works 100%. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the manufacture and promotion of sunscreens. Sunscreens are given a SPF (Sun Protection Factor) number that indicates how long a person can remain in the sun without burning. It is recommended that people use products with a SPF of 15 or greater. Sunscreens are not generally recommended for infants six months old or younger. Infants should be kept in the shade as much as possible and should be dressed in protective clothing to prevent any skin exposure and damage.
There is no such thing as "all-day protection" or "waterproof" sunscreen. No matter what the SPF number, sunscreens need to be re-applied every 2 to 3 hours. Products that claim to be "waterproof" can only protect against sunburn up to 80 minutes in the water. Products labeled "water resistant" can only protect against sunburn up to 40 minutes in the water.
Even in the worst weather, 80% of the sun's UV rays can pass through the clouds. Additionally, sand reflects 25% of the sun's UV rays and snow reflects 80% of the sun's UV rays. That's why sunscreen needs to be worn every day and in every type of weather and climate. The sun's intensity is also impacted by altitude (the higher the altitude the greater the sun exposure), time of year (summer months) and location (the closer to the Equator, the greater the sun exposure).
Look for sunscreens that use the term "broad spectrum" because they protect against both UVA and UVB rays.
Choose a sunscreen with a minimum SPF rating of 15.
Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before you head out into the sun to give it time to seep into the skin.
Apply sunscreens liberally. Use at least one ounce to cover the entire body.
Use a lip balm with SPF 15 or greater to protect the lips from sun damage.
Re-apply sunscreen immediately after going into water or sweating.
Re-apply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours.
Use sunscreen every day regardless of the weather.
Wear sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV rays.
Wear wide-brimmed hats and protective clothing to limit skin exposure to the sun.
Stay in the shade whenever possible.
If you experience a sunburn, get out of the sun and cover the exposed skin as soon as possible. A sunburn will begin to appear within 4 to 6 hours after getting out of the sun and will fully appear within 12 to 24 hours. Mild burns cause redness and some peeling after a few days. They can be treated with cold compresses on the damaged area, cool baths, moisturizers to prevent dryness and over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams to relieve any pain or itching. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids when you experience any type of sunburn.
More serious burns lead to blisters, which can be painful. It is important not to rupture blisters as this slows down the natural healing process and may lead to infection. You may want to cover blisters with gauze to keep them clean. Stay out of the sun until your skin has fully healed. In the most severe cases, oral steroids may be prescribed to prevent or eliminate infection along with pain-relieving medication.

 How dangerous are those UV lights really?
If you’re a gel manicure fan you know they beam and shine on your nails, last way longer than a traditional mani without chipping, and dry in what seems like seconds.
But as amazing as gel manicures are, there is, sadly, a downside–and it has to do with that drying process. Technically called “curing,” it involves lamps that emit ultraviolet A (UVA) rays, the very same rays you catch outside from the sun (and from indoor tanning beds). And also the very same rays dermatologists are always warning us to avoid if we also want to avoid premature aging and skin cancer. Sigh.
“We know that cumulative exposure to UV radiation over a lifetime is the biggest risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer,” says Ashley Wysong, MD, associate professor and chair of the department of dermatology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The younger you start getting gel manicures (or tanning), the more lifetime exposure you’ll get, and the higher your lifetime risk for skin cancer.
There haven’t been any large studies on exactly what risk gel manicures pose. But in 2009, in the journal JAMA Dermatology, researchers did document skin cancer on the hands of two women who had no previous personal or family history of the condition and who had both used nail lamps.
But–good news!–that doesn’t mean you should never get a gel manicure.
Michele S. Green, MD, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, had one gel manicure and says, “It was the best manicure I’ve ever done.” She had an important function to attend, she says, and doesn’t plan to make a habit of it.
Once in a while is probably okay–say, if you’re invited to a royal wedding. “But if you’re thinking that this is something safe to do all the time, you’re fooling yourself,” Dr. Green says.
You also might be getting fooled by salons that are now saying they use LED lights and not ultraviolet rays. “If you actually look at the spectrum of light being emitted, they do include UVA and/or UVB radiation,” warns Dr. Wysong.
Before your next gel mani, you might want to adopt these precautions to make the process at least a little bit safer.
Use sunblock. Yes, really. Lather up your hands before a gel manicure with broad-spectrum (covering both UVA and UVB light) sunscreen with an SPF of 30 to 50, says Dr. Wysong.
Consider fingerless sun-protective gloves. Just like you can buy protective clothing with a UPF rating (the fabric version of SPF), you can buy manicure-ready protection for your hands, too. You’ll want to look for fingerless gloves with UPF 50, Dr. Wysong says, like these flashy ones from ManiGlovz ($25; maniglovz.com) or a more understated pair from MelodySusie ($11; amazon.com).
Pick the right polish. If you’re doing a gel manicure at home, make sure your polish and lamp play nicely together. Different polish formulas require different types of curing lights, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Always follow instructions on any at-home kits.
Scope out your salon ahead of time. The manicure itself may not turn out as well as planned if you don’t have careful, experienced practitioners–and then you've exposed your hands to UV light without the benefit of a great mani. Make sure the salon is clean overall, and follow the same precautions you would for any manicure, like not having your cuticles cut, since cutting can raise your risk for infection.
Avoid gel manicures if you have weak or brittle nails. They’re more likely to be damaged by a gel manicure. You might also want to stay away from gel if you know you’re super-sensitive to UV light. Keep in mind that certain meds, including some antibiotics, can make you extra-sensitive to UV rays.

There is no sunscreen or sunblock that works 100%. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the manufacture and promotion of sunscreens. Sunscreens are given a SPF (Sun Protection Factor) number that indicates how long a person can remain in the sun without burning. It is recommended that people use products with a SPF of 15 or greater. Sunscreens are not generally recommended for infants six months old or younger. Infants should be kept in the shade as much as possible and should be dressed in protective clothing to prevent any skin exposure and damage.
There is no such thing as "all-day protection" or "waterproof" sunscreen. No matter what the SPF number, sunscreens need to be re-applied every 2 to 3 hours. Products that claim to be "waterproof" can only protect against sunburn up to 80 minutes in the water. Products labeled "water resistant" can only protect against sunburn up to 40 minutes in the water.
Even in the worst weather, 80% of the sun's UV rays can pass through the clouds. Additionally, sand reflects 25% of the sun's UV rays and snow reflects 80% of the sun's UV rays. That's why sunscreen needs to be worn every day and in every type of weather and climate. The sun's intensity is also impacted by altitude (the higher the altitude the greater the sun exposure), time of year (summer months) and location (the closer to the Equator, the greater the sun exposure).
Look for sunscreens that use the term "broad spectrum" because they protect against both UVA and UVB rays.
Choose a sunscreen with a minimum SPF rating of 15.
Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before you head out into the sun to give it time to seep into the skin.
Apply sunscreens liberally. Use at least one ounce to cover the entire body.
Use a lip balm with SPF 15 or greater to protect the lips from sun damage.
Re-apply sunscreen immediately after going into water or sweating.
Re-apply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours.
Use sunscreen every day regardless of the weather.
Wear sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV rays.
Wear wide-brimmed hats and protective clothing to limit skin exposure to the sun.
Stay in the shade whenever possible.
If you experience a sunburn, get out of the sun and cover the exposed skin as soon as possible. A sunburn will begin to appear within 4 to 6 hours after getting out of the sun and will fully appear within 12 to 24 hours. Mild burns cause redness and some peeling after a few days. They can be treated with cold compresses on the damaged area, cool baths, moisturizers to prevent dryness and over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams to relieve any pain or itching. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids when you experience any type of sunburn.
More serious burns lead to blisters, which can be painful. It is important not to rupture blisters as this slows down the natural healing process and may lead to infection. You may want to cover blisters with gauze to keep them clean. Stay out of the sun until your skin has fully healed. In the most severe cases, oral steroids may be prescribed to prevent or eliminate infection along with pain-relieving medication.
 5 -9.36444 How dangerous are those UV lights really?
If you’re a gel manicure fan you know they beam and shine on your nails, last way longer than a traditional mani without chipping, and dry in what seems like seconds.
But as amazing as gel manicures are, there is, sadly, a downside–and it has to do with that drying process. Technically called “curing,” it involves lamps that emit ultraviolet A (UVA) rays, the very same rays you catch outside from the sun (and from indoor tanning beds). And also the very same rays dermatologists are always warning us to avoid if we also want to avoid premature aging and skin cancer. Sigh.
“We know that cumulative exposure to UV radiation over a lifetime is the biggest risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer,” says Ashley Wysong, MD, associate professor and chair of the department of dermatology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The younger you start getting gel manicures (or tanning), the more lifetime exposure you’ll get, and the higher your lifetime risk for skin cancer.
There haven’t been any large studies on exactly what risk gel manicures pose. But in 2009, in the journal JAMA Dermatology, researchers did document skin cancer on the hands of two women who had no previous personal or family history of the condition and who had both used nail lamps.
But–good news!–that doesn’t mean you should never get a gel manicure.
Michele S. Green, MD, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, had one gel manicure and says, “It was the best manicure I’ve ever done.” She had an important function to attend, she says, and doesn’t plan to make a habit of it.
Once in a while is probably okay–say, if you’re invited to a royal wedding. “But if you’re thinking that this is something safe to do all the time, you’re fooling yourself,” Dr. Green says.
You also might be getting fooled by salons that are now saying they use LED lights and not ultraviolet rays. “If you actually look at the spectrum of light being emitted, they do include UVA and/or UVB radiation,” warns Dr. Wysong.
Before your next gel mani, you might want to adopt these precautions to make the process at least a little bit safer.
Use sunblock. Yes, really. Lather up your hands before a gel manicure with broad-spectrum (covering both UVA and UVB light) sunscreen with an SPF of 30 to 50, says Dr. Wysong.
Consider fingerless sun-protective gloves. Just like you can buy protective clothing with a UPF rating (the fabric version of SPF), you can buy manicure-ready protection for your hands, too. You’ll want to look for fingerless gloves with UPF 50, Dr. Wysong says, like these flashy ones from ManiGlovz ($25; maniglovz.com) or a more understated pair from MelodySusie ($11; amazon.com).
Pick the right polish. If you’re doing a gel manicure at home, make sure your polish and lamp play nicely together. Different polish formulas require different types of curing lights, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Always follow instructions on any at-home kits.
Scope out your salon ahead of time. The manicure itself may not turn out as well as planned if you don’t have careful, experienced practitioners–and then you've exposed your hands to UV light without the benefit of a great mani. Make sure the salon is clean overall, and follow the same precautions you would for any manicure, like not having your cuticles cut, since cutting can raise your risk for infection.
Avoid gel manicures if you have weak or brittle nails. They’re more likely to be damaged by a gel manicure. You might also want to stay away from gel if you know you’re super-sensitive to UV light. Keep in mind that certain meds, including some antibiotics, can make you extra-sensitive to UV rays.

This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

Many of the chemicals used in pesticides are persistent soil contaminants, whose impact may endure for decades and adversely affect soil conservation. The use of pesticides decreases the general biodiversity in the soil. Not using the chemicals results in higher soil quality, with the additional effect that more organic matter in the soil allows for higher water retention. This helps increase yields for farms in drought years, when organic farms have had yields 20-40% higher than their conventional counterparts. A smaller content of organic matter in the soil increases the amount of pesticide that will leave the area of application, because organic matter binds to and helps break

  A soil conditioner is a product which is added to soil to improve the soil’s physical qualities, usually its fertility (ability to provide nutrition for plants) and sometimes its mechanics. In general usage, the term "soil conditioner" is often thought of as a subset of the category soil amendments (or soil improvement, soil condition), which more often is understood to include a wide range of fertilizers and non-organic materials. Soil conditioners can be used to improve poor soils, or to rebuild soils which have been damaged by improper soil management.

  The extensive use of pesticides in agricultural production can degrade and damage the community of microorganisms living in the soil, particularly when these chemicals are overused or misused as chemical compounds build up in the soil. The full impact of pesticides on soil microorganisms is still not entirely understood; many studies have found deleterious effects of pesticides on soil microorganisms and biochemical processes, while others have found that the residue of some pesticides can be degraded and assimilated by microorganisms. The effect of pesticides on soil microorganisms is impacted by the persistence, concentration, and toxicity of the applied pesticide, in addition to various environmental factors. This complex interaction of factors makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the interaction of pesticides with

  In the context of nutrition, a mineral is a chemical element required as an essential nutrient by organisms to perform functions necessary for life. However, the four major structural elements in the human body by weight (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen), are usually not included in lists of major nutrient minerals (nitrogen is considered a "mineral" for plants, as it often is included in fertilizers). These four elements compose about 96% of the weight of the human body, and major minerals (macrominerals) and minor minerals (also called trace elements) compose the remainder. Nutrient minerals, being elements, cannot be synthesized biochemically by living organisms. Plants get minerals from soil. Most of the minerals in a human diet come

 Microorganisms play a crucial role in decomposing detritus in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Detritus refers to non-living organic material such as dead organisms, fragments of organisms, or fecal material. When detritus is present, it becomes colonized by communities of microorganisms that initiate the process of decomposition.

In terrestrial ecosystems, detritus can be found on the soil surface or intermixed with soil. Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi break down this organic matter into simpler compounds through a process called decomposition or remineralization. These microorganisms secrete enzymes that help break down complex molecules into smaller ones, which are then absorbed by other organisms or further broken down into inorganic nutrients that can be used by plants.

Similarly, in aquatic ecosystems, detritus refers to organic material suspended in water. Along with plankton, detritus forms an important part of seston (suspended materials) and may accumulate at the base of a water column. Microorganisms present in water bodies play a vital role in breaking down this detritus through similar processes of decomposition.

The decomposition of detritus by microorganisms is essential for nutrient cycling in ecosystems. As microorganisms break down organic matter, they release nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals back into the environment. These nutrients are then available for uptake by plants and other organisms, contributing to the overall productivity and functioning of the ecosystem.

Overall, microorganisms are key players in decomposing detritus in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Their activities contribute to nutrient recycling and energy flow within these ecosystems, supporting the growth and survival of various organisms within them.

Reference:
- In biology, detritus is non-living particulate organic material (as opposed to dissolved organic material). It typically includes the bodies of dead organisms or fragments of organisms or fecal material.
- Detritus is normally colonized by communities of microorganisms which act to decompose (or remineralize) the material.
- In terrestrial ecosystems, the term refers to litter on the soil surface as well as organic matter intermixed with soil.
- In aquatic ecosystems, the term refers to organic material found suspended in water. Together with plankton, detritus is an important constituent of seston (materials in suspension), and may also accumulate at the base of a water column.

 The desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri has important feeding habits and ecological roles in the desert ecosystem. According to a study on this species, desert isopods are saprovores, herbivores, and microbivores. They feed on dead organic matter, vegetation, and microorganisms present in the soil. It has been observed that in order to survive, the isopods need to include soil particles and/or soil minerals in their diet.

The feeding habits of H. reaumuri contribute to the desert ecosystem in several ways. Firstly, these isopods play a role in the decomposition process. By ingesting and defecating organic matter and inorganic soil particles, they alter the structure of the decomposition substrate. This alteration increases the rate of decomposition in the desert ecosystem.

Additionally, the isopods contribute to energy flow in the ecosystem. The study estimated that the annual energy flow by H. reaumuri is in the range of 10.3-38.6 kcals/m². This energy flow represents approximately 3-12% of the available dead organic matter. By consuming and processing organic material, these isopods transfer energy within the desert food web.

Furthermore, the desert isopod also plays a role in soil turnover. The study estimates that H. reaumuri contributes to a soil turnover of 28.5-105.7 g/m² each year. This activity helps to mix the soil and distribute organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling and soil health in the desert ecosystem.

In conclusion, Hemilepistus reaumuri, the desert isopod, has a diverse feeding habit, including being a saprovore, herbivore, and microbivore. Its feeding habits contribute to the desert ecosystem through its role in decomposition, energy flow, and soil turnover. By altering the structure of the decomposition substrate and increasing decomposition rates, these isopods play a crucial part in nutrient cycling and ecosystem dynamics in desert environments.
