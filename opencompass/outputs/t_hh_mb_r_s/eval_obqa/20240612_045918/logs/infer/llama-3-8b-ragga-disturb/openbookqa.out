["The best way to guess a baby's eye color is by looking at the genealogy records of their family. This is because eye color is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the genes that determine eye color are passed down from generation to generation. By examining the eye colors of the baby's parents, grandparents, and other close relatives, it's possible to make an educated guess about what the baby's eye color might be. While the surroundings and diet of the baby may have some impact on eye color, these factors are generally not significant enough to significantly alter the baby's eye color. Ultimately, the best way to determine a baby's eye color is to wait and see.", 'What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?\nA. The surroundings they are born in.\nB. Their parents usual diet.\nC. Just take a random guess.\nD. The genealogy records of their family.']
