According to Monolopolus' website, Recovery was shot in collaboration with Mercy Flight and Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), and includes footage of a reenacted helicopter flight to ECMC, giving a portrayal of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) air transport that was available to Faulkner to rush him to the hospital. The film had an approximate budget of $15,000. Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. The book remains available on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats. Monolopolus told Holmes that \"Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people \"...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible.\" Since the release of the book and documentary, Faulkner has spoken publicly on the topics of TBI, rehabilitation, motivation and recovery. Later in 2019, Faulkner participated in a video feature in support of Mercy Flight, describing his accident, the EMS support, his recovery and motivations. The video was featured at the 2019 \"Beacon of Hope Gala\" to raise money for their causes. In December 2020, Faulkner was recorded for two videos for the Brainwaves Video Anthology channel on YouTube. In the videos, Faulkner shared his story, and how he hopes to have an impact on the lives of others, just as so many others helped him. Apparently, months had gone by–the calendar on the wall already had the first few days of May crossed off. The nightmare was real. But first I had to survive–a mere 20% likelihood.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Included on the album is the now classic “Angels of Fenway,” a tribute to the Boston Red Sox World Series championship season in 2004. Additional episodes currently being produced include an interview with the author of a new biography about Gordon Lightfoot and an in-depth interview with Merilee Rush (“Angel of the Morning”). During that time, the band saturated the music charts and radio stations with songs such as “I’m a Believer,” “Daydream Believer,” “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Valleri,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone” and many others. The group consisted for Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, and the four had been assembled by producers at Screen Gems for the television show. In the beginning, the members of the group didn’t have much say in the music they recorded, and their vocals were their main contributions. However, the Monkees were eventually able to wrestle away more control of the recordings, and their musical careers continued after the television show ended. This episode of Documenting Popular Music, takes a look at the individual members of the Monkees and what they did after the break up – in the 1970s and 1980s. Velez, who has a wealth of knowledge about the group, also offers some behind the scenes history, including how the Monkees and the Beatles hung out together, and how Dolenz ended up using a Beatles song in an episode of the Monkees TV show. Dan Fogelberg passed away 10 years ago this month. This episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at the tribute album and artist such as Garth Brooks, who performs “Phoenix” with Trisha Yearwood providing background vocals; the late Donna Sumer, who sings an inspiring version of “Nether Lands” using the same backing track that Fogelberg used for the 1977 classic; Amy Grant and Vince Gill, who provide a duet on “Longer” that gives new life to Fogelberg’s biggest hit; Randy Owen, the legendary voice of the group Alabama – the best-selling country group of all time – sings “Sutter’s Mill,” originally from Fogelberg’s progressive bluegrass album ‘High Country Snows;’ Zac Brown and his band deliver a live version of “Leader of the Band;” and Fogelberg’s good friend Joe Walsh of the Eagles sings “Part of the Plan,” a song he originally produced for Fogelberg for the 1974 album Souvenirs. Other artists on the album include Michael McDonald, Jimmy Buffett, Boz Scaggs, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band with Richie Furay, the late Dobie Gray, Train, Fool’s Gold (originally Fogelberg’s backing band) and Casey James. Included in this presentation is inside, background information from Fogelberg’s former record producer, Norbert Putnam, one of the tribute album’s co-producers.

(Thank you Norbert) During our conversation, he told me about Garth Brooks’ and Donna Summer’s involvement with the tribute album; however, the lineup of stars on the album had not yet been released, and Jean asked that I not use the info for the show.

Cochran would go on to re-record the song for release on Aire Records (1962), in a slightly different tempo, with some changes to the lyrics and for re-release on King Records in 1963. In all, Cochran recorded four versions of the song, the original, Gala #117, Boblo Records #101, King Records #5856, and Aire Records #150, released as \"Last Kiss\" b/w \"Edge of the Sea\", with Cochran sharing vocals with an unnamed male vocalist.

Putnam explains how Brooks and Summer got involved in the project, which is a true labor of love from Fogelberg’s widow, Jean Fogelberg, also a producer on the album. (Thank you Norbert) During our conversation, he told me about Garth Brooks’ and Donna Summer’s involvement with the tribute album; however, the lineup of stars on the album had not yet been released, and Jean asked that I not use the info for the show.

Cochran would go on to re-record the song for release on Aire Records (1962), in a slightly different tempo, with some changes to the lyrics and for re-release on King Records in 1963. In all, Cochran recorded four versions of the song, the original, Gala #117, Boblo Records #101, King Records #5856, and Aire Records #150, released as \"Last Kiss\" b/w \"Edge of the Sea\", with Cochran sharing vocals with an unnamed male vocalist.

Wayne Cochran (vocals), Joe Carpenter (guitar), Bobby Rakestraw (bass), and Jerry Reppert (drums) recorded the song for the Gala label, a small label based in Vidalia. When the labels for the 45s, Gala #117, were printed, the names of co-writers Joe Carpenter, Randall Hoyal and Bobby McGlon were left off. Cochran evidently never asked Gala to change the label, to include the other \n\nSoldier boy, ; One kiss before you go, soldier boy ; I'll miss you, that you know, ; Ev'ry night I'll pray for you far away, ; And trust to Him above ; To send you back some day ; In my heart ; A love will always yearn, ; And I'll wait for your return.\n\n"

This rule, which originated from a famous legal case in the early 19th century, provides criteria to determine whether an individual can be held criminally responsible for their actions based on their mental state at the time of the offense. According to McNaughton's rule, a person is legally insane and not criminally responsible if, at the time of the crime, they were suffering from a mental disorder or defect that caused them to either not understand the nature and quality of their actions or not understand that their actions were morally wrong. To evaluate a defendant's mental state, the court usually relies on expert testimony from psychiatrists or psychologists, who assess the individual's mental capacity and provide insights into their understanding of the crime committed. The court will consider factors such as the presence of a mental illness, the defendant's ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions, and their ability to differentiate right from wrong. It is important to note that while McNaughton's rule is widely accepted in many countries, different jurisdictions may have variations in their definitions of criminal responsibility for the insane. In summary, McNaughton's rule is a commonly used standard to determine the criminal responsibility of the insane. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception. In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility. For example, if someone accidentally started a forest fire by dropping a match while lighting a cigarette, this would not be arson because the defendant didn't have the required criminal intent or guilty mental state.In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result.Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act.Violence is another focus of treatment with psychopaths; violent behavior can be managed with administrative disciplinary procedures within the correctional facility. By now he realized that he was not going to escape a prison term for rape, and the insanity defense was sounding more and more appealing. Dr. Huber explained that just having a mental disorder was not enough to meet the legal criteria for insanity. \"In order to be legally insane, you have to have some connection between the mental disorder and the crime,\" he said. \"There must be some evidence that the mental illness affected your ability to understand what you were doing, or that what you were doing was wrong. The state has to prove two issues to convict a defendant.

During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the Mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. In 1830, on the eve of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population.

Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government).

During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the Mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. In 1830, on the eve of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns. In 1840, Britain intervened and returned control of \n\n In 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I. Muslim rulers from Sudan and the Arabian Peninsula were dominant in the African Red Sea coast until the Ottoman Turks arrived in the 16th century. The ports of Suakin and Massawa were occupied by Özdemir Pasha, who had been appointed beylerbey in 1555, and the province of Habesh was formed \n\n In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government). Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further \n\n From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire.\n\n"

She intends to run on the ruling National Resistance Movement political party ticket. In an attempt to conserve funds, Aceng as minister has accused some universities of graduating too many substandard doctors, although both the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC) and the East African Community Medical and Dental Practitioners Boards and Councils disagree with her. Perhaps the most controversial of all her proposals is the new requirement that interns take a new national examination, before the health ministry can assign them an internship slot.\n\n"

Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts. Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments. Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently. This teaching approach is widely employed in fields such as law, philosophy, and education, as it nurtures a deeper understanding and helps students become more proficient in analytical thinking and problem-solving. In conclusion, the Socratic method of teaching is an interactive and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to think critically and actively participate in the learning process.

They work closely with students on a one-on-one basis, spending dedicated time with them on a regular basis, whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly. Their primary goal is to help students improve their understanding and performance in the subject matter they are seeking assistance with. They may use different instructional techniques, such as explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, providing additional practice materials, offering step-by-step guidance through problem-solving processes, and giving constructive feedback on assignments or assessments. By providing personalized attention and support, tutors create a supportive learning environment that encourages students to ask questions, engage actively in the learning process, and develop effective study habits. been many times called the century of creativity and innovation, so as society matures, there are more and more creative people, and the need in educating such people is becoming more vivid.\" and put it into the classroom \n\n technologies, \"students have also improved their reading comprehension, writing skills, and their abilities to plan, analyze, and interpret results as they progress through the media project.\" Through this process, they are exposed to different \n\nThe Socratic method of teaching is a pedagogical approach that focuses on stimulating critical thinking and promoting active learning. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts. Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments. Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently. This teaching approach is widely employed in fields such as law, philosophy, and education, as it nurtures a deeper understanding and helps students become more proficient in analytical thinking and problem-solving. In conclusion, the Socratic method of teaching is an interactive and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to think critically and actively participate in the learning process. By asking thought-provoking questions, teachers promote analytical reasoning, foster intellectual growth, and facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\n"

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. by Bloody Disgusting. Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\".

Sometimes kids make it through basically sane. But most do not, and most when they are enduring the abuse, must dissociate to survive it. My dBPDso has the Jekyll and Hyde thing - most of the time she's sweet and child-like, thoughtful and generous and accepting and loving. The nice, self-effacing person is replaced by an abusive b_tch. I know it's her, it's not a different personality--it's part of her personality that only wakes up when the working part of her brain is triggered in particular ways and stops working right. Sometimes she fears that it is DID, most of the time she says she knows it's not. (She knows what's going on. The strange and awe inspiring part of the arguements I still have trouble with, is she looked directly over the top of my head while raging frantically, her face white as a ghost, not bulging red like one would think and her eyes were glassed over. The difference is that in someone with full blown DID, the dissociation is much more severe and dramatic. Each of the dissociated parts has a different name, different abilities (including being able to speak languages the other alters cannot), and different relationships with the outside world of which the other \"alters\" are usually totally ignorant. Someone with DID might be named Jane on her birth certificate, but at work she is known as Mary because that is the alter who got the job. Typically, in someone with DID there is one core alter who has all the dirt about all the others. It takes a LOT of very intense, very evil and prolonged abuse to produce DID, from what I understand. I'm definitely with you Bitdawg! I have avoided talking about his DID problems on this site so that it wouldn't get confusing and I am actually glad that someone brought it up. I can tell which personality he is in by how he talks, what vocabulary he uses, his writing changes, his memories change and more so than just changing something to be better than it actually was, he doesn't even remember that something happened, I have had to break up with him numerous times. I agree with notmyproblem's comments about the age thing. My friend has about 5 personalities, each at a different age - supoosedly they are ages when traumas happened, major or minor, and the person couldn't cope so split off into another personality. The worst part is the person I knew so well is the one that never comes out anymore and she's forgotten about. She says that persona is locked away some where way down deep inside her and may never come back because it hurts too much. my friend has changed her name and doesn't remember things that happened before, right down to interests and core values. The original used to be a passionate reader, confident and a great leader - she was training to be a teacher and would have been darn good at it. When everything happened she gave up on that goal, I once made a comment saying it's a shame she would have been good at it and she replied with no x would have been good at it, she's alseep now, y has no interest in anything like that. the other personalities are also used to split things off from herself that she doesn't like. She has one character who is sick with bullimia and anorexia, one that represents her sexuality who she doesn't like, one that represents her anger etc. Or you made character z feel threatened and about to be abandoned so she lashed out at you with intense anger to protect the main persona. Having both is incredibly difficult. Their multiple personalities have completely different attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions. I can say that! LOL. Thanks for the personal explanation, karmickiss! Oh the tangled web! It's been a while... .I am still friendly with the young man who was my biggest problem area last time I was here. But, that was the exception... .there's my mom... and then like I said, this young man, who has been my friend(and we had a fling, long time ago) but I had to put some boundaries into place. The thing is, the male figure in my kids lives. Tumors of the nose and sinus in dogs are often difficult to diagnose at first. These tumors are located inside the nasal passages, invisible to the naked eye, at least in the earlier stages. Many times a guardian will notice that their four legged family member starts to sneeze more often. The first thought can be,”Does my dog have a cold?” Sometimes there will be a bit of a cough. Oftentimes, a veterinarian will simply dispense some antibiotics to see if it clears up. However, if a dog has a tumor in the nasal passageways, any positive effect of the antibiotics will be short lived. Sometimes guardians will be upset that the tumor was missed initially. This feeling is natural since nasal tumors are serious. If every dog that arrived at a veterinary hospital with a runny nose was taken for a skull X-ray under anesthesia and sent for a CT scan, most would say this did not make sense. If 9 out of 10 dogs received the diagnosis of a simple nasal infection after all this testing, most guardians would be unhappy due to overly aggressive testing. How does one actually diagnose a nasal cancer? A vet may not be able to say definitively that the X-ray changes are due to a cancer in the nose. More information about these important cancers can be found in The Dog Cancer Survival Guide. Hi I was wondering what breeds are prone to nose cancer? According to Dr. Dressler in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, there are certain breeds at a higher risk for developing nasal tumors including Airedale Terriers, Basset Hounds, Collies, German Shepherds, German Short-Haired Pointers, Keeshounds, and Olde English Sheepdogs. You can read more about nasal cancer in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, which starts on page 360. Hello Mike, Any attempt at giving you a number on which to focus, would not be responsible and would only distract you from enjoying your girl’s joy. 15 is a wonderful age… never enough of course, but it sounds like she is having a grand time. When my very senior dog was becoming very senior, I learned to take my direction from him instead of trying to guide things with my human will. When our dogs get to a good age they surpass us in wisdom. You know your dog better than anyone. Give her a wonderful cuddle for me please. Barbara, There is no danger to your children from Lexis cancer itself, but if you do treat with chemotherapy drugs you may need to isolate her at times, and keep the children away from any of her waste. That’s the “if” you will need to hear from your vet if you do use conventional treatment. Other than that, the joy they have in being together is healing for Lexi as well as your children. Help the children understand her journey and hold her in their hearts rather than being afraid of this strange situation. Does anyone know if it’s safe for my 3 and 7 year old kids to be around my dog lexi. She has been diagnosed with a cancer tumor in her nose and is sneezing blood. But I am worried about the kids and the cancerous blood when she sneezes. https://www.dogcancerblog.com/video/nasal-tumors-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-dogs-cancer/ Sometimes it is, even though it sounds like an extreme action to take. It’s great that Mario is still active and has a great appetite. I hope you’re getting him on the Dog Cancer Diet to really optimize that appetite and give him the foods that will help him stay strong. The main points of the diet are available in a free download at the top right of this blog, or at http://www.dogcancerdiet.com. Also in Dr Dressler’s book The Dog Cancer Survival Guide. About your questions, by all means reach out to the people in this blog, but also ask these questions to your vet. It’s easy to forget some details amongst the emotion of the vet office. While Mario is wagging his tail and enjoying his food, he knows that life is good and sweet. If things don’t go well, Mario will tell you when he’s had enough. All the best to you both, and a special cuddle to Mario. Our faithful companion, Mario, 11 year old Weish Terrier, was just diagnosed with a sinus tumor. He had a CT scan which confirmed our Vets initial thinking. Mario is experiencing nose bleeds (not severe) & some trouble breathing. Being a Terrier, Mario is still active, has great appetite & somehow I get the sense that he is hiding how uncomfortable he really is. We absolutely don’t want Mario to suffer uneccessarily for our selfish reasons but he is a big part of our family & the thought of not doing all we can is not an option. Thank you for any help & to all you folks who are pet lovers like us, may there always be a Mario in your life! Please get your boy on the best nutrition you can (www.dogcancerdiet.com) and work with your vet for the best options for him. Our 2 1/2 year old golden lab mix was diagnoised last november with a nasal tumor. We had done the CT scan, rhinoscopy and surgery……a great cost but with much hope that we would have our pup for a long time. I have been in contact with the Dr that did the surgery and she had advised us to go back to our local vet and they can advise on how to keep him “comfortable” since the cost of the surgery was extravagant and we are unable to provide that again. Any advice on what to ask our local vet when we go next Tueday? My 6 year old golden retriever was informally diagnosed with a nasal tumor 10 months ago after many months of testing which all showed nothing. At one point, we thought we were going to lose her because she was so sick and had lost so much weight. After more inconclusive testing at a very expensive teaching hospital, I took her back to my regular vet who diagnosed her with the nasal tumor. This is our 2nd golden with cancer, and having been through it already and seeing what the treatment did to our other dog, we decided to just ride this one out. We got a diagnosis of a nasal tumor in our beautiful Pepper, a 10-year-old Great Dane, after a biopsy that cleared much of the obstruction in her right nostril……Right now she is exhibiting signs that may say she is in pain…tucking herself in to the corner dog bed (her pal Moose, a 9-year-old Dane uses whatever bed is available)…and when Moose goes upstairs to sleep on the memory foam bed all day…Pepper has been uncharacteristically staying on the corner bed downstairs…ALL DAY. So her energy is not great, but she is as sweet as ever, and very much welcomes a massage and fussing over her…I have just read almost the entire Dog Cancer Survival Guide over the past two days. What I would like to know is whether it makes sense in a Dane of this age to do a CT scan…or whether we should just go forward with the homemade diet, Apocaps….she is taking Tramadol and Rimadyl for hip dysplasia and perhaps arthritis so not sure if that precludes certain treatments or perhaps we could replace Rimadyl with something else (another inflammatory)? sorry to hear about your Pepper. In the end, as a guardian, the decision will be yours, and will be correct as long as you have done your homework. We can go over all the options as they relate to Pepper at an appointment. My husband’s 4 year old Brussels Griffon, also service dog, was diagnosed with sinus cancer. I can’t figure this out, as I read this cancer usually appears in older, male dogs, with long snouts. Has anyone ever heard of this happening to such a young dog? My 6 year old puggle has become congested (cloudy mucous) from his nose for the last 8 months. His reverse sneeze has also become much more frequent. After numerous trips to the vet, his sneezing and mucous as only got worse. Any ideas if it could be anything else? His demeanor and eating habits are the same – should I push for a CT Scan? Her current vet is the one who gave us hope when another vet we went to gave us none. But now, even the current vet is giving up on treatment for her because of the metastasis..\nWe are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. We will also be ordering the Dog Cancer Survival Guide and Apocaps from Amazon as soon as we get our next paycheck. I have read up on artemisinin from your previous blog post. Within a week’s time from my post above, things just went downhill fast..\nLast Friday when we brought Precious in for her weekly chemo injection, another vet (hervet was on leave) told us they would discuss about the option of freezing the tumor when her vet is back seeing her tumor growing bigger despite on chemo treatment. On Monday, we noticed her jaw trembled on and off and on Wednesday night, we discovered a new lump at her neck near to her jaw.. Off to vet again the very next day. Her vet just took a look at the new lump and said her cancer is spreading and there’s nothing much they can do for her. He did says that if we want surgery to remove it, he could do it but it will come back and he don’t see any point in putting Precious through GA, surgery, recovery, etc. I’m wondering…have you read the Dog Cancer Survival Guide? Is Precious on the diet? Apocaps? My 7 year old Silky Terrier, Precious, was diagnosed with nasal tumor after a CT scan was performed in December 2012. Despite her illness, we are thankful that she is still pretty much playful, happy and sniffing everything when we go for our daily walks. We are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. If she smells anything different with her food, she refuses eating it even after we prepared another supplement-free portion for her. Well we lost our Ellie yesterday. We did everything we could to keep her happy in her last day. Good luck to all of you and I wish you all the best with your pets. X-rays showed nothing and we were refereed to U of M Vet. The vet did however suggest Proxicam for TJ, I was just wondering if anyone else had used Proxicam alone with out the chemo or radiation treatments and if they think it is worth having our pet take. We are not able to afford radiation and such for our dog. @ Joey’s Mom…it is terrible and so stressful going through this, and poor Max is still doing everything he wants to do. I dont know alot which is even more frightening too.. My dog Ellie has a nasal tumor. Sorry about Ellie’s tumor and that you are not getting more help from your vet. If your vet is not offering treatment options or a referral, I recommend finding an oncologist. I am glad you found our blog! @ Loulou Spencer, I’m glad my comments, for what they were worth, were of some help to you. It’s just so terribly sad we have to deal with this. And if Max is anything like Joey at this time, I’m sure he has no clue the horror that’s growing inside him. The very best of luck in this nightmare we all find ourselves in. This is a follow up to my comment left last week, with regard to my dog Joey, and the prognosis of his nasal cancer. It is worse than hoped, the cancer he has is aggressive and we’ve decided not to subject him to any more anxiety, and let nature run it’s course. I was told by my vet he can remain on this, but should have his kidney function checked if he is on it longer than 2 months. If any of these side effects occur stop and contact your vet. I leave this site with the hopes that my experience can help another family deal with this horrible situation a little better. I recommend Yannan and use it regularly for dogs with nasal tumors when there are bleeding episodes. My 7 year old Brussel Griffons “Bug” has been to Auburn University for a CT scan and biopsy of the mass in her left nasal passage. Bug has had problems with her left nostil for at least a year, clear mucus and a wheez. I never worrried to much about it and neither did the vet. 9Griffons have the short nose and snort like a Bulldog anyway. She is not the same dog. My Ellie has been bleeding from her nose more this week. The vet decided she most likely has a tumor since her nasal passage/throat/larynx all look good. He scoped her nose and could not find anything. Now her nose is bleeding again. I want to thank all of you ( with the exception of Shenaz) for your helpful and informational posts. My black lab, Jake, has had severe sneezing for the past couple weeks. I am taking him to the vet tomorrow and pray that it is nothing more than sinunitis or allergies. this is very sad for me that my 15 year old mixed female dog has a nose tumor. we thought for sure it was allergies but it is not. she eats well and still is the same old cheyenne we had for years. iam sorry shenaz that you can NOT understand how the love of one animal brings so much joy to you. i hope you can find that love one day with a pet of your own. And thank you for helping all of us, who are trying to deal with thine enemy, “CANCER”, in whatever form it takes, for our furry loved ones. Be they canine or feline, they are members of our families. If you feel that way about dogs, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why you would bother to post on this site. You have insulted me, and anyone else who is legitimately, seeking help and advice for a situation that involves both people and animals. And it know no bounds. People who have cancer or people who love someone or something that has cancer, are in enough grief and pain, that you really have no business posting anything here. And the hope to find a solution to help someone or something to battle this horrible disease. And I came to this site, hoping to get answers about fighting the disease that, Sam, my little Jack Russell/Schauzer mix has, and who I adopted from an abusive and neglected situation back in 2001. He is more loyal and non-complaining than most people that I know. My heart goes out to anyone, who reads your comment, because it is really not meant to be here, since it is a real ‘slap-in-the-face’ to anyone who’s facing their dilemna with a loved, four- legged, furry companion, who is a member of their family. Dr. D. (or whoever monitors your site, I do NOT have a problem with you deleting my post or the post above.) I’m appreciating any info/advice I can get to help my little guy, Sam. It is a shame you have not had the opportunity to enjoy a connection or a relationship with non-human animals. Oh these stories sound so familar to what iam going through with my collie Lassie.She has been a sneezer most of ther adult life.As soon as i seen the green bloodish discharge we went straight to the vet.They started with taken xrays that showed a grayish area around the teeth area an where the spot was on her face under her eye an antibotics for 10days.That didnt work so we tried a strong one for 5 days no better after that.So i took her back an they took a sample from her an sent it off.The results came back 3 days later that it was nasal cancer.I was broken hearted to find this out but i know that i was very aggressive with the vet to get to the bottom of this.She is now on piroxicam until the end.My big question now is how long do i have with her? I am sorry this is happening to your Lassie. All of the above is very consistent with Hunny’s nasal tumor. About how long do most dogs have with a nasal tumor? Then another in March so I bring her to her vet. Short story, more green mucous shows up in April and more antibiotics are called for. But the mucous goes and returns so I take Jett to some vets I know who are able to get x-rays of Jett’s head without requiring Jett to be put under. So, on May 20th, we get a CT and I learn Jett has a nasal tumor and a mass on the right atrium. What I haven’t shared is that in the month of April, Jett survived emergency abdominal surgery for bloat (stomach twists- torsion). She also has subsequent visits to vets for the nasal discharge when I thought she got an infection while in hospital. I found The Dog Cancer Survival Guide and began reading. But he also informed me of alternatives to the Big Three that gave me some hope I could help Jett. To close I must say a few things, first, I think my vet whiffed, that is swung and missed by prescribing antibiotics instead of saying, Mike- she’s eleven years old, a large breed and the chances for cancer being in that nose are high. And sadly Mike, we are seeing a high incidence of cancer in our pets these days. Let’s get some pictures. And so we need to become the boss of our pet’s care. And we need to carefully consider the toxins we, ourselves introduce into our pets’ lives. And if we can, we need vets who are educating themselves in the broad view when comes to treating cancer in our pets. The bottom line is-most vets today will not countenance nutraceuticals in their plan to fight pet cancers. This is slowly changing and Dr. Dressler is an example of the change for our pet’s betterment. Lastly, if you have a pet who is a senior, pure breed, but otherwise in what seems good health – review everything and don’t be passive. My vet should have added up all that was working against Jett in this moment. What it is. Vets should become cancer proactive and talk frankly about cancer, we’re adults, we can take it. The book, like Schmidt's other children's novels, has a \"realistic, modern setting\" —Pluk drives a little truck and has a difficult time finding a place to live—but his world is full of fairy-tale creatures, such as, in this case, talking cockroaches, pigeons, and seagulls; horses of record-length; extinct fantastical birds; and a werewolf who operates a ferry. In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. Pluk, a young red-haired boy, lives alone in a little room on the top floor of the Petteflet, an apartment building. He has no parents, but he does have a little tow truck. He quickly makes friends, such as Zaza, a cockroach, and Mr. Penn, who operates a bookstore. J goes about her work in a sunny, quiet way, and is one of the best herbs for repairing nerve damage anywhere in the body. She works well with her field friend, wild oats, when there has been any trauma or damage to the brain/central nervous system.

Chrislyn earned her degree of Doctor of Veterinary of Medicine from Benguet State University. Chrislyn then took on the role of Pet Care Consultant at one of Singapore's leading pet shops for almost four years, till her desire and enthusiasm to be part of the rewarding circle of small animal practice redirected her to Amber Vet. Back home, Chrislyn is accompanied by her adorable white furball mixed breed (Shih Tzu crossed Maltese) named Lucky. Thereafter, she further pursued and acquired the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. She was given the opportunity to expose herself in real-life veterinary practices in Taiwan and United States during her study. From a young age, Chin regularly fed and played with stray cats around her home, which sparked her love for animals. She even keeps one of the stray cats as her pet now named “Ling Ling”. She loves readings and is eager to learn new things, and also strives to sharpen her skills in the veterinary field in order to provide the best care for all animals under her care. Tracy graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Diploma in Veterinary Bioscience. Her love for animals prompted her to take up this course of study, and subsequently working in veterinary care. She is always keen to learn new veterinary techniques and constantly improves herself in order to provide the best to the animals under her care. She enjoys her free time with her two dogs - a Golden Retriever, \"Whisky\", and a Jack Russell Cross \"Pepper\". Her love for animals began growing up in England, surrounded by wildlife and the countryside. She is the loving owner of a Bombay cat, also coincidentally named Amber. Josephine has had a variety of pets growing up, and is passionate about all animals big and small. She started out at Amber Vet as a veterinary assistant before pursuing and completing her Associate Degree in Veterinary Nursing, and now, she’s back at Amber Vet as a certified veterinary nurse. She thoroughly enjoys her job as a veterinary nurse, especially caring for senior dogs and cats, and hospitalised patients. She also strongly believes in low stress handling of all animals that visit the clinic. Josephine is currently unowned by any animal, but hopes that will change in the near future, preferably by a senior cat. Growing up with animals all her life, her childhood dream was to work in an animal related industry. Hence, she quit her job and started pet sitting, long term boarding, caring for special needs dogs, and also volunteering at animal shelters. Her dog massage certification has come in handy for the elderly dogs she cared for. During her free time, she spends her day with Maya, her Golden Retriever whom she is devoted to. They hang out at dog cafes, the beach and also trying out new doggie recipes. She loves exploring new places and trying out new foods. Being a animal enthusiast, she decided to pursue her passion and worked as a veterinary nurse for 2 years. Along the way, she discovered her interest in practice and inventory management, and thus became the purchasing officer for the veterinary practice she was at. Joanna now manages the practice's inventory, along with IT and other administrative duties, ensuring that the practice is running like clockwork, allowing the team to treat all animals efficiently and to the best standards possible. Joanna receives unconditional love from ZaiZai, a Shetland Sheepdog, NuNu, a Miniature Pinscher, and LeLe, a ginger cat. Melissa was previously in the media and production industry with experience in casting talents for films and advertisements. Her love and respect for all animals led her to join Amber Cat Vet where she hopes to learn more about how to care for them and contribute to the animal care industry. She grew up with a tankful of fishes, over a dozen hamsters and her family at present loves and cares for “Fatty Bonds”, a spoilt but loving rabbit who enjoys endless petting and belly rubs.\n\nQuestion: what's the bunnies name in secret life of pets\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Borderline is a one fractured personality. Sometimes kids make it through basically sane. But most do not, and most when they are enduring the abuse, must dissociate to survive it. My dBPDso has the Jekyll and Hyde thing - most of the time she's sweet and child-like, thoughtful and generous and accepting and loving. The nice, self-effacing person is replaced by an abusive b_tch. I know it's her, it's not a different personality--it's part of her personality that only wakes up when the working part of her brain is triggered in particular ways and stops working right. Sometimes she fears that it is DID, most of the time she says she knows it's not. (She knows what's going on. The strange and awe inspiring part of the arguements I still have trouble with, is she looked directly over the top of my head while raging frantically, her face white as a ghost, not bulging red like one would think and her eyes were glassed over. The difference is that in someone with full blown DID, the dissociation is much more severe and dramatic. Each of the dissociated parts has a different name, different abilities (including being able to speak languages the other alters cannot), and different relationships with the outside world of which the other \"alters\" are usually totally ignorant. Someone with DID might be named Jane on her birth certificate, but at work she is known as Mary because that is the alter who got the job. Typically, in someone with DID there is one core alter who has all the dirt about all the others. It takes a LOT of very intense, very evil and prolonged abuse to produce DID, from what I understand. I'm definitely with you Bitdawg! I have avoided talking about his DID problems on this site so that it wouldn't get confusing and I am actually glad that someone brought it up. I can tell which personality he is in by how he talks, what vocabulary he uses, his writing changes, his memories change and more so than just changing something to be better than it actually was, he doesn't even remember that something happened, I have had to break up with him numerous times. I agree with notmyproblem's comments about the age thing. My friend has about 5 personalities, each at a different age - supoosedly they are ages when traumas happened, major or minor, and the person couldn't cope so split off into another personality. The worst part is the person I knew so well is the one that never comes out anymore and she's forgotten about. She says that persona is locked away some where way down deep inside her and may never come back because it hurts too much. my friend has changed her name and doesn't remember things that happened before, right down to interests and core values. The original used to be a passionate reader, confident and a great leader - she was training to be a teacher and would have been darn good at it. When everything happened she gave up on that goal, I once made a comment saying it's a shame she would have been good at it and she replied with no x would have been good at it, she's alseep now, y has no interest in anything like that. the other personalities are also used to split things off from herself that she doesn't like. She has one character who is sick with bullimia and anorexia, one that represents her sexuality who she doesn't like, one that represents her anger etc. Or you made character z feel threatened and about to be abandoned so she lashed out at you with intense anger to protect the main persona. Having both is incredibly difficult. Their multiple personalities have completely different attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions. I can say that! LOL. Thanks for the personal explanation, karmickiss! Oh the tangled web! It's been a while... .I am still friendly with the young man who was my biggest problem area last time I was here. But, that was the exception... .there's my mom... and then like I said, this young man, who has been my friend(and we had a fling, long time ago) but I had to put some boundaries into place. The thing is, the male figure in my kids lives. Tumors of the nose and sinus in dogs are often difficult to diagnose at first. These tumors are located inside the nasal passages, invisible to the naked eye, at least in the earlier stages. Many times a guardian will notice that their four legged family member starts to sneeze more often. The first thought can be,”Does my dog have a cold?” Sometimes there will be a bit of a cough. Oftentimes, a veterinarian will simply dispense some antibiotics to see if it clears up. However, if a dog has a tumor in the nasal passageways, any positive effect of the antibiotics will be short lived. Sometimes guardians will be upset that the tumor was missed initially. This feeling is natural since nasal tumors are serious. If every dog that arrived at a veterinary hospital with a runny nose was taken for a skull X-ray under anesthesia and sent for a CT scan, most would say this did not make sense. If 9 out of 10 dogs received the diagnosis of a simple nasal infection after all this testing, most guardians would be unhappy due to overly aggressive testing. How does one actually diagnose a nasal cancer? A vet may not be able to say definitively that the X-ray changes are due to a cancer in the nose. More information about these important cancers can be found in The Dog Cancer Survival Guide. Hi I was wondering what breeds are prone to nose cancer? According to Dr. Dressler in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, there are certain breeds at a higher risk for developing nasal tumors including Airedale Terriers, Basset Hounds, Collies, German Shepherds, German Short-Haired Pointers, Keeshounds, and Olde English Sheepdogs. You can read more about nasal cancer in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, which starts on page 360. Hello Mike, Any attempt at giving you a number on which to focus, would not be responsible and would only distract you from enjoying your girl’s joy. 15 is a wonderful age… never enough of course, but it sounds like she is having a grand time. When my very senior dog was becoming very senior, I learned to take my direction from him instead of trying to guide things with my human will. When our dogs get to a good age they surpass us in wisdom. You know your dog better than anyone. Give her a wonderful cuddle for me please. Barbara, There is no danger to your children from Lexis cancer itself, but if you do treat with chemotherapy drugs you may need to isolate her at times, and keep the children away from any of her waste. That’s the “if” you will need to hear from your vet if you do use conventional treatment. Other than that, the joy they have in being together is healing for Lexi as well as your children. Help the children understand her journey and hold her in their hearts rather than being afraid of this strange situation. Does anyone know if it’s safe for my 3 and 7 year old kids to be around my dog lexi. She has been diagnosed with a cancer tumor in her nose and is sneezing blood. But I am worried about the kids and the cancerous blood when she sneezes. https://www.dogcancerblog.com/video/nasal-tumors-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-dogs-cancer/ Sometimes it is, even though it sounds like an extreme action to take. It’s great that Mario is still active and has a great appetite. I hope you’re getting him on the Dog Cancer Diet to really optimize that appetite and give him the foods that will help him stay strong. The main points of the diet are available in a free download at the top right of this blog, or at http://www.dogcancerdiet.com. Also in Dr Dressler’s book The Dog Cancer Survival Guide. About your questions, by all means reach out to the people in this blog, but also ask these questions to your vet. It’s easy to forget some details amongst the emotion of the vet office. While Mario is wagging his tail and enjoying his food, he knows that life is good and sweet. If things don’t go well, Mario will tell you when he’s had enough. All the best to you both, and a special cuddle to Mario. Our faithful companion, Mario, 11 year old Weish Terrier, was just diagnosed with a sinus tumor. He had a CT scan which confirmed our Vets initial thinking. Mario is experiencing nose bleeds (not severe) & some trouble breathing. Being a Terrier, Mario is still active, has great appetite & somehow I get the sense that he is hiding how uncomfortable he really is. We absolutely don’t want Mario to suffer uneccessarily for our selfish reasons but he is a big part of our family & the thought of not doing all we can is not an option. Thank you for any help & to all you folks who are pet lovers like us, may there always be a Mario in your life! Please get your boy on the best nutrition you can (www.dogcancerdiet.com) and work with your vet for the best options for him. Our 2 1/2 year old golden lab mix was diagnoised last november with a nasal tumor. We had done the CT scan, rhinoscopy and surgery……a great cost but with much hope that we would have our pup for a long time. I have been in contact with the Dr that did the surgery and she had advised us to go back to our local vet and they can advise on how to keep him “comfortable” since the cost of the surgery was extravagant and we are unable to provide that again. Any advice on what to ask our local vet when we go next Tueday? My 6 year old golden retriever was informally diagnosed with a nasal tumor 10 months ago after many months of testing which all showed nothing. At one point, we thought we were going to lose her because she was so sick and had lost so much weight. After more inconclusive testing at a very expensive teaching hospital, I took her back to my regular vet who diagnosed her with the nasal tumor. This is our 2nd golden with cancer, and having been through it already and seeing what the treatment did to our other dog, we decided to just ride this one out. We got a diagnosis of a nasal tumor in our beautiful Pepper, a 10-year-old Great Dane, after a biopsy that cleared much of the obstruction in her right nostril……Right now she is exhibiting signs that may say she is in pain…tucking herself in to the corner dog bed (her pal Moose, a 9-year-old Dane uses whatever bed is available)…and when Moose goes upstairs to sleep on the memory foam bed all day…Pepper has been uncharacteristically staying on the corner bed downstairs…ALL DAY. So her energy is not great, but she is as sweet as ever, and very much welcomes a massage and fussing over her…I have just read almost the entire Dog Cancer Survival Guide over the past two days. What I would like to know is whether it makes sense in a Dane of this age to do a CT scan…or whether we should just go forward with the homemade diet, Apocaps….she is taking Tramadol and Rimadyl for hip dysplasia and perhaps arthritis so not sure if that precludes certain treatments or perhaps we could replace Rimadyl with something else (another inflammatory)? sorry to hear about your Pepper. In the end, as a guardian, the decision will be yours, and will be correct as long as you have done your homework. We can go over all the options as they relate to Pepper at an appointment. My husband’s 4 year old Brussels Griffon, also service dog, was diagnosed with sinus cancer. I can’t figure this out, as I read this cancer usually appears in older, male dogs, with long snouts. Has anyone ever heard of this happening to such a young dog? My 6 year old puggle has become congested (cloudy mucous) from his nose for the last 8 months. His reverse sneeze has also become much more frequent. After numerous trips to the vet, his sneezing and mucous as only got worse. Any ideas if it could be anything else? His demeanor and eating habits are the same – should I push for a CT Scan? Her current vet is the one who gave us hope when another vet we went to gave us none. But now, even the current vet is giving up on treatment for her because of the metastasis..\nWe are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. We will also be ordering the Dog Cancer Survival Guide and Apocaps from Amazon as soon as we get our next paycheck. I have read up on artemisinin from your previous blog post. Within a week’s time from my post above, things just went downhill fast..\nLast Friday when we brought Precious in for her weekly chemo injection, another vet (hervet was on leave) told us they would discuss about the option of freezing the tumor when her vet is back seeing her tumor growing bigger despite on chemo treatment. On Monday, we noticed her jaw trembled on and off and on Wednesday night, we discovered a new lump at her neck near to her jaw.. Off to vet again the very next day. Her vet just took a look at the new lump and said her cancer is spreading and there’s nothing much they can do for her. He did says that if we want surgery to remove it, he could do it but it will come back and he don’t see any point in putting Precious through GA, surgery, recovery, etc. I’m wondering…have you read the Dog Cancer Survival Guide? Is Precious on the diet? Apocaps? My 7 year old Silky Terrier, Precious, was diagnosed with nasal tumor after a CT scan was performed in December 2012. Despite her illness, we are thankful that she is still pretty much playful, happy and sniffing everything when we go for our daily walks. We are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. If she smells anything different with her food, she refuses eating it even after we prepared another supplement-free portion for her. Well we lost our Ellie yesterday. We did everything we could to keep her happy in her last day. Good luck to all of you and I wish you all the best with your pets. X-rays showed nothing and we were refereed to U of M Vet. The vet did however suggest Proxicam for TJ, I was just wondering if anyone else had used Proxicam alone with out the chemo or radiation treatments and if they think it is worth having our pet take. We are not able to afford radiation and such for our dog. @ Joey’s Mom…it is terrible and so stressful going through this, and poor Max is still doing everything he wants to do. I dont know alot which is even more frightening too.. My dog Ellie has a nasal tumor. Sorry about Ellie’s tumor and that you are not getting more help from your vet. If your vet is not offering treatment options or a referral, I recommend finding an oncologist. I am glad you found our blog! @ Loulou Spencer, I’m glad my comments, for what they were worth, were of some help to you. It’s just so terribly sad we have to deal with this. And if Max is anything like Joey at this time, I’m sure he has no clue the horror that’s growing inside him. The very best of luck in this nightmare we all find ourselves in. This is a follow up to my comment left last week, with regard to my dog Joey, and the prognosis of his nasal cancer. It is worse than hoped, the cancer he has is aggressive and we’ve decided not to subject him to any more anxiety, and let nature run it’s course. I was told by my vet he can remain on this, but should have his kidney function checked if he is on it longer than 2 months. If any of these side effects occur stop and contact your vet. I leave this site with the hopes that my experience can help another family deal with this horrible situation a little better. I recommend Yannan and use it regularly for dogs with nasal tumors when there are bleeding episodes. My 7 year old Brussel Griffons “Bug” has been to Auburn University for a CT scan and biopsy of the mass in her left nasal passage. Bug has had problems with her left nostil for at least a year, clear mucus and a wheez. I never worrried to much about it and neither did the vet. 9Griffons have the short nose and snort like a Bulldog anyway. She is not the same dog. My Ellie has been bleeding from her nose more this week. The vet decided she most likely has a tumor since her nasal passage/throat/larynx all look good. He scoped her nose and could not find anything. Now her nose is bleeding again. I want to thank all of you ( with the exception of Shenaz) for your helpful and informational posts. My black lab, Jake, has had severe sneezing for the past couple weeks. I am taking him to the vet tomorrow and pray that it is nothing more than sinunitis or allergies. this is very sad for me that my 15 year old mixed female dog has a nose tumor. we thought for sure it was allergies but it is not. she eats well and still is the same old cheyenne we had for years. iam sorry shenaz that you can NOT understand how the love of one animal brings so much joy to you. i hope you can find that love one day with a pet of your own. And thank you for helping all of us, who are trying to deal with thine enemy, “CANCER”, in whatever form it takes, for our furry loved ones. Be they canine or feline, they are members of our families. If you feel that way about dogs, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why you would bother to post on this site. You have insulted me, and anyone else who is legitimately, seeking help and advice for a situation that involves both people and animals. And it know no bounds. People who have cancer or people who love someone or something that has cancer, are in enough grief and pain, that you really have no business posting anything here. And the hope to find a solution to help someone or something to battle this horrible disease. And I came to this site, hoping to get answers about fighting the disease that, Sam, my little Jack Russell/Schauzer mix has, and who I adopted from an abusive and neglected situation back in 2001. He is more loyal and non-complaining than most people that I know. My heart goes out to anyone, who reads your comment, because it is really not meant to be here, since it is a real ‘slap-in-the-face’ to anyone who’s facing their dilemna with a loved, four- legged, furry companion, who is a member of their family. Dr. D. (or whoever monitors your site, I do NOT have a problem with you deleting my post or the post above.) I’m appreciating any info/advice I can get to help my little guy, Sam. It is a shame you have not had the opportunity to enjoy a connection or a relationship with non-human animals. Oh these stories sound so familar to what iam going through with my collie Lassie.She has been a sneezer most of ther adult life.As soon as i seen the green bloodish discharge we went straight to the vet.They started with taken xrays that showed a grayish area around the teeth area an where the spot was on her face under her eye an antibotics for 10days.That didnt work so we tried a strong one for 5 days no better after that.So i took her back an they took a sample from her an sent it off.The results came back 3 days later that it was nasal cancer.I was broken hearted to find this out but i know that i was very aggressive with the vet to get to the bottom of this.She is now on piroxicam until the end.My big question now is how long do i have with her? I am sorry this is happening to your Lassie. All of the above is very consistent with Hunny’s nasal tumor. About how long do most dogs have with a nasal tumor? Then another in March so I bring her to her vet. Short story, more green mucous shows up in April and more antibiotics are called for. But the mucous goes and returns so I take Jett to some vets I know who are able to get x-rays of Jett’s head without requiring Jett to be put under. So, on May 20th, we get a CT and I learn Jett has a nasal tumor and a mass on the right atrium. What I haven’t shared is that in the month of April, Jett survived emergency abdominal surgery for bloat (stomach twists- torsion). She also has subsequent visits to vets for the nasal discharge when I thought she got an infection while in hospital. I found The Dog Cancer Survival Guide and began reading. But he also informed me of alternatives to the Big Three that gave me some hope I could help Jett. To close I must say a few things, first, I think my vet whiffed, that is swung and missed by prescribing antibiotics instead of saying, Mike- she’s eleven years old, a large breed and the chances for cancer being in that nose are high. And sadly Mike, we are seeing a high incidence of cancer in our pets these days. Let’s get some pictures. And so we need to become the boss of our pet’s care. And we need to carefully consider the toxins we, ourselves introduce into our pets’ lives. And if we can, we need vets who are educating themselves in the broad view when comes to treating cancer in our pets. The bottom line is-most vets today will not countenance nutraceuticals in their plan to fight pet cancers. This is slowly changing and Dr. Dressler is an example of the change for our pet’s betterment. Lastly, if you have a pet who is a senior, pure breed, but otherwise in what seems good health – review everything and don’t be passive. My vet should have added up all that was working against Jett in this moment. What it is. Vets should become cancer proactive and talk frankly about cancer, we’re adults, we can take it.

Chrislyn then took on the role of Pet Care Consultant at one of Singapore's leading pet shops for almost four years, till her desire and enthusiasm to be part of the rewarding circle of small animal practice redirected her to Amber Vet. Back home, Chrislyn is accompanied by her adorable white furball mixed breed (Shih Tzu crossed Maltese) named Lucky. Thereafter, she further pursued and acquired the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. She was given the opportunity to expose herself in real-life veterinary practices in Taiwan and United States during her study. From a young age, Chin regularly fed and played with stray cats around her home, which sparked her love for animals. She even keeps one of the stray cats as her pet now named “Ling Ling”. She loves readings and is eager to learn new things, and also strives to sharpen her skills in the veterinary field in order to provide the best care for all animals under her care. Tracy graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Diploma in Veterinary Bioscience. Her love for animals prompted her to take up this course of study, and subsequently working in veterinary care. She is always keen to learn new veterinary techniques and constantly improves herself in order to provide the best to the animals under her care. She enjoys her free time with her two dogs - a Golden Retriever, \"Whisky\", and a Jack Russell Cross \"Pepper\". Her love for animals began growing up in England, surrounded by wildlife and the countryside. She is the loving owner of a Bombay cat, also coincidentally named Amber. Josephine has had a variety of pets growing up, and is passionate about all animals big and small. She started out at Amber Vet as a veterinary assistant before pursuing and completing her Associate Degree in Veterinary Nursing, and now, she’s back at Amber Vet as a certified veterinary nurse. She thoroughly enjoys her job as a veterinary nurse, especially caring for senior dogs and cats, and hospitalised patients. She also strongly believes in low stress handling of all animals that visit the clinic. Josephine is currently unowned by any animal, but hopes that will change in the near future, preferably by a senior cat. Growing up with animals all her life, her childhood dream was to work in an animal related industry. Hence, she quit her job and started pet sitting, long term boarding, caring for special needs dogs, and also volunteering at animal shelters. Her dog massage certification has come in handy for the elderly dogs she cared for. During her free time, she spends her day with Maya, her Golden Retriever whom she is devoted to. They hang out at dog cafes, the beach and also trying out new doggie recipes. She loves exploring new places and trying out new foods. Being a animal enthusiast, she decided to pursue her passion and worked as a veterinary nurse for 2 years. Along the way, she discovered her interest in practice and inventory management, and thus became the purchasing officer for the veterinary practice she was at. Joanna now manages the practice's inventory, along with IT and other administrative duties, ensuring that the practice is running like clockwork, allowing the team to treat all animals efficiently and to the best standards possible. Joanna receives unconditional love from ZaiZai, a Shetland Sheepdog, NuNu, a Miniature Pinscher, and LeLe, a ginger cat. Melissa was previously in the media and production industry with experience in casting talents for films and advertisements. Her love and respect for all animals led her to join Amber Cat Vet where she hopes to learn more about how to care for them and contribute to the animal care industry. She grew up with a tankful of fishes, over a dozen hamsters and her family at present loves and cares for “Fatty Bonds”, a spoilt but loving rabbit who enjoys endless petting and belly rubs.\n\n"

The blood–brain barrier is formed by endothelial cells of the capillary wall, astrocyte end-feet ensheathing the capillary, and pericytes embedded in the capillary basement membrane. The blood–brain barrier restricts the passage of pathogens, the diffusion of solutes in the blood, and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid, while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones) and small non-polar molecules. The barrier also restricts the passage of peripheral immune factors, like signaling molecules, antibodies, and immune cells, into the CNS, thus insulating the brain from damage due to peripheral immune events. Specialized brain structures participating in sensory and secretory integration within brain neural circuits—the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus—have in contrast highly permeable capillaries. Structure \n\nThe BBB results from the selectivity of the tight junctions between the endothelial cells of brain capillaries, restricting the passage of solutes. At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are adjoined continuously by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits of transmembrane proteins, such as occludin, claudins (such as Claudin-5), junctional adhesion molecule (such as JAM-A). The BBB is composed of endothelial cells restricting passage of substances from the blood more selectively than endothelial cells of capillaries elsewhere in the body. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood-retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers. Not all vessels in the human brain exhibit BBB properties. Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland.

Pericytes help to maintain homeostatic and hemostatic functions in the brain, one of the organs with higher pericyte coverage, and also sustain the blood–brain barrier. These cells are also a key component of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons. A deficiency of pericytes in the central nervous system can cause increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a complex structure that separates the blood vessels in the brain from the surrounding brain tissue. It plays a vital role in protecting the brain by regulating the exchange of substances between the blood and the brain. The two major cellular components that form the blood-brain barrier are the foot processes of astrocytes and the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. They wrap their extensions, called foot processes, around the blood vessels in the brain, contributing to the formation of the BBB. In the brain, the endothelial cells have specialized characteristics that are crucial for creating a tight barrier. These cells are closely connected to one another by tight junctions, which prevent the passage of most substances, including certain drugs and toxins, from the blood into the brain tissue. The combined arrangement of the foot processes of astrocytes and the specialized endothelial cells forms a physical and biochemical barrier that restricts the entry of potentially harmful substances from the blood into the brain. The presence of tight junctions, transporters, and enzymes within the BBB further help in controlling the movement of substances in and out of the brain. Overall, the blood-brain barrier is formed by the intricate interactions between the foot processes of astrocytes and the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries, working together to protect the brain from potentially harmful substances in the blood.

The two major cellular components that form the blood-brain barrier are the foot processes of astrocytes and the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. They wrap their extensions, called foot processes, around the blood vessels in the brain, contributing to the formation of the BBB. In the brain, the endothelial cells have specialized characteristics that are crucial for creating a tight barrier. These cells are closely connected to one another by tight junctions, which prevent the passage of most substances, including certain drugs and toxins, from the blood into the brain tissue. The combined arrangement of the foot processes of astrocytes and the specialized endothelial cells forms a physical and biochemical barrier that restricts the entry of potentially harmful substances from the blood into the brain. The presence of tight junctions, transporters, and enzymes within the BBB further help in controlling the movement of substances in and out of the brain. Overall, the blood-brain barrier is formed by the intricate interactions between the foot processes of astrocytes and the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries, working together to protect the brain from potentially harmful substances in the blood. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside. The blood–brain barrier is formed by endothelial cells of the capillary wall, astrocyte end-feet ensheathing the capillary, and pericytes embedded in the capillary basement membrane. The blood–brain barrier restricts the passage of pathogens, the diffusion of solutes in the blood, and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid, while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones) and small non-polar molecules. The barrier also restricts the passage of peripheral immune factors, like signaling molecules, antibodies, and immune cells, into the CNS, thus insulating the brain from damage due to peripheral immune events. Specialized brain structures participating in sensory and secretory integration within brain neural circuits—the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus—have in contrast highly permeable capillaries. Structure \n\nThe BBB results from the selectivity of the tight junctions between the endothelial cells of brain capillaries, restricting the passage of solutes. At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are adjoined continuously by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits of transmembrane proteins, such as occludin, claudins (such as Claudin-5), junctional adhesion molecule (such as JAM-A). The BBB is composed of endothelial cells restricting passage of substances from the blood more selectively than endothelial cells of capillaries elsewhere in the body. The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood-retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers. Not all vessels in the human brain exhibit BBB properties. Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland. Measurement of brain uptake of various blood-borne solutes showed that newborn endothelial cells were functionally similar to those in adults, indicating that a selective BBB is operative at birth. Function \n\nThe blood–brain barrier acts effectively to protect the brain from circulating pathogens. Circumventricular organs\n\nCircumventricular organs (CVOs) are individual structures located adjacent to the fourth ventricle or third ventricle in the brain, and are characterized by dense capillary beds with permeable endothelial cells unlike those of the blood–brain barrier. Such zones exist at the border of the area postrema—nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and median eminence—hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood–brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Damage in injury and disease\nThe blood–brain barrier may become damaged in select neurological diseases, as indicated by neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, and brain trauma, and in systemic diseases, such as liver failure. Effects such as impaired glucose transport and endothelial degeneration may lead to metabolic dysfunction within the brain, and an increased permeability of the BBB to proinflammatory factors, potentially allowing antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. Thus, in theory, they had failed to enter the brain. At that time, it was thought that the blood vessels themselves were responsible for the barrier, since no obvious membrane could be found.

They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill.  On June 25, 1941, he died from bacterial endocarditis, an infection of his heart valves. Elion never married or had children. However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. After Burroughs Wellcome moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, Elion moved to nearby Chapel Hill. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science. Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999. Elion's research contributed to the development of:\n\n Mercaptopurine (Purinethol), the first treatment for leukemia, also used in organ transplantation.\n\n"

Other chapters deal with specific arthropods that transmit disease organisms to humans. This chapter deals with vertebrates that expose humans to disease organisms without benefit of an arthropod vector or that are primary reservoirs of organisms that cause important human disease. Included are domestic (house mouse, rat) and wild or sylvan rodents. These rodents can infect humans directly with diseases such as tularemia, leptospirosis, arenavirus, hantavirus, ratbite fever, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and salmonellosis (food poisoning). They also may serve as reservoirs for diseases transmitted by ectoparasites, such as tick-borne relapsing fever, Colorado tick fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, plague, murine typhus, rickettsial pox, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and tularemia. Birds, bats and small mammals can be carriers of rabies, histoplasmosis, listeriosis or leptospirosis. Commensal (domestic or urban) and sylvan (wild) rodents occasionally are targeted for control measures. Three species of urban rodents, Mus musculus (house mouse), Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and Rattus rattus (roof rat), create the principal rodent problems. Rats. The Norway rat (synonymous with brown, dump, barn, sewer, gray or wharf rat) is a burrowing rodent. The Norway rat has a blunt muzzle, small eyes and short, close-set ears. Its fur is coarse and usually brownish- or reddish-gray, with whitish-gray hair on the belly. Its nearly naked, scaly tail is dark on the top and light on the underside and is shorter (6 to 8½ inches) than the combined length of the head and body (7 to 10 inches). Adults weigh 12 to 18 ounces. They are good climbers and can reach a distance of 13 inches while standing on the ground and jump 24 inches vertically. The Norway rat has relatively poor vision but keen senses of smell, touch, taste and hearing. The sense of touch is served by long whiskers on the snout. They feed on virtually anything edible. Gnawing marks. Recent gnawings on wood are light in color, darkening with age. Droppings. Pet excitement. A smooth patch of flour or talc laid down in a runway may show activity. In addition to rodent signs, accessibility of food and harborage indicates relative population potential and environmental factors favorable for rodent infestations. In instances of plague or murine typhus, a program to control ectoparasites should precede or accompany rodent control, especially in urban or other densely populated areas and high-use recreational areas in the West. Blocking rodent access is a major factor in rodent control. Rats, for example, can gain entrance through openings larger than ½ inch square; mice require only ¼ inch. Conversely, they often enter buildings whose doors are left open for long periods. Steel wool, lath screen and copper mesh are materials that can be packed tightly into holes to close openings or protect other areas from gnawing. Sewers are inhabited by Norway rats in some cities and towns. Because Norway rats are excellent swimmers, water traps do not impede their movement. The problem of rats in sewers is usually greatest in places where sanitary sewers are interconnected with storm sewers, thus providing multiple entry points. The domestic sewer of an average community provides enough food to sustain a large number of rats, a problem that has increased with the advent of garbage-disposal units. Blackberry brush, for example, is a common harborage for rats. Within buildings, stairways, cabinets, lockers, machinery, double walls, false ceilings and floors, boxed-in pipes, and conduits may serve as shelter and nesting and breeding sites. Trapping. Trapping has several advantages. It does not rely on inherently hazardous rodenticides, and it permits users to view their success. These traps are designed to catch and hold one or more animals by means of a falling or sliding door, triggered when the rodent enters or nibbles at a bait. Effective trapping of commensal rodents depends on an understanding of basic behavioral traits. For example, Norway rats, while as agile as tree squirrels when necessary, are more at home on the ground and will normally be caught there, whereas roof rats are fond of climbing and can be taken more frequently from their runs along pipes and supporting beams. Mice are much more inquisitive than rats and will investigate a newly placed trap, whereas rats are apt to avoid it. Ketch-All type traps, wire live traps and snap traps designed only for mice are not considered dangerous, although they may bruise the fingers of a child. Bait selection and placement. Bait boxes should be clearly labeled \"Rat Bait\" or \"Mouse Bait,\" as the case may be. Examine paraffin- bait blocks for signs of rodent gnawing. Rodents have food preferences. Norway rats accept cereals, fruit, nuts, vegetables, meats and fish, but roof rats do not readily eat meat or fish. Rodenticides. When they consume a sublethal amount of an acute toxicant, bait shyness may result. Therefore, bait shyness is not a problem. The powder adheres to the rodents' feet and fur and is consumed during grooming. Rodent competition. There is some competition between commensal rodents. Partial separation between rats and mice occurs, for example, in grain stacks where house mice feed in the lower areas and rats in upper portions. Upon direct confrontation, rats will kill mice. Resistance to rodenticides. When a rodent population has a rather high number of individuals that are less susceptible to a rodenticide, resistance becomes a concern. Pest control operators should constantly be aware of resistance as a source of control failures. Consider all rodenticides dangerous, and place baits where only rodents can get them. Handle the carcasses with tongs or rubber gloves. Health risks from birds are often exaggerated. Nevertheless, large populations of roosting birds may present risks of disease to people nearby. Food may be contaminated by birds, but this risk is usually limited to food manufacturing or processing plants. Cryptococcosis can result from pigeon droppings, which appear to be the most important source of the disease fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans. Like histoplasmosis, outbreaks of this disease often occur after building renovation, roost clean-up or other actions that disturb the old droppings. Other diseases carried or transmitted by birds affect humans to a lesser degree. Psittacosis, pigeon ornithosis and toxoplasmosis are normally mild in humans; however, serious illness or death can occur in rare cases. Pigeons and sparrows have also been implicated (along with many other species of birds) in outbreaks of encephalitis. Ectoparasites of pigeons, starlings and house sparrows can invade buildings. Some of these parasites bite and irritate humans. With very few exceptions, all birds are protected by one or more federal laws and regulations. Pigeons, starlings and house sparrows are not directly protected at the federal level, but applications of toxicants or repellents must be made according to the product label and under the restrictions that apply under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). State and local regulations may require permits or restrict actions taken against pest birds. Pigeons. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) developed from the rock doves of Europe and Asia and was introduced into the U.S. as a domestic bird. Rock doves originally nested in caves, holes and under overhanging rocks on cliffs, so they comfortably adapt to window ledges, roofs, eaves, steeples and other components of man-made structures. Although primarily seed or grain eaters, in urban areas pigeons feed on garbage, spilled grains, insects, food left by outdoor diners and food provided by bird lovers who intentionally feed pigeons. Pigeons are gregarious. When not feeding or mating, most of their day is spent cooing, preening and sunbathing. Pigeons prefer flat and smooth surfaces on which to rest and feed, and, unlike most birds, they will feed from rooftops, regardless of height, because they like openness that permits a speedy escape. Building roofs and ledges, cooling towers, bridges and signs are typical roosting and loafing sites. Feeding sites include parks, squares, food loading docks, garbage areas, railroad sidings, food plants and wherever people eat outdoors. Male pigeons are sexually mature at three to four months of age, females at six months. They mate for life unless separated by death or accident. After pairing and mating, nest construction begins in protected openings in or on buildings and structures. They share incubation responsibilities for the one or two eggs produced, the male from midmorning through afternoon and the female the rest of the day and evening. Adult birds can mate again while the young are still in the nest. Pigeons nest during all seasons when conditions permit. Nests that are continually used become solid with droppings, feathers, debris and sometimes dead birds. Starlings. Starlings are robin-sized birds that weigh about 3 ounces. They nest in holes or cavities in trees or rocks, in urban areas on buildings, in birdhouses, and on power stations, water towers and other structures. Both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the young, which leave the nest when they are about three weeks old. Starlings migrate in some parts of the country. The major sources of food shift from insects and fruits to grains, seeds, livestock rations and garbage. Each starling eats about an ounce of food daily. Instead of flying straight into the roosts when returning just before sundown, they \"stage\" on high perches such as trees, power lines, bridges, and towers. The birds are quite social at these times and remain on pre-roost sites until after sunset, singing and calling to one another. Starlings are pests because of their high numbers. Thousands or tens of thousands can roost at one site. The birds are noisy, consume large quantities of livestock feed and contaminate water at stockyards. House sparrows. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus), also called the English sparrow, was introduced into the U.S. in the 1850s. While sparrows are still one of the most common birds, their numbers have fallen drastically since the 1920s when food and waste from horses furnished unlimited food. Breeding can occur in any month throughout much of the country but is most common from March through August. Eggs are incubated for about two weeks, and the young stay in the nest another two weeks. Nests, bulky and roofed over, are located in trees and shrubs, on building ledges, in signs, on light fixtures and under bridges. Sparrows are aggressive and social birds, often outcompeting native species. They have no recognized migration patterns and will stay in an area as long as food and nest sites are available. Young birds, however, move out of an area to establish new territories in flocks of juvenile birds and nonbreeding adults that may travel four or five miles from nest sites to feeding areas. Sparrows are very tolerant of human activity and will not hesitate to set up housekeeping in high-traffic areas. They feed preferentially on grain and also on fruits, seeds and garbage, and can be pests in many situations. Sparrows also can become pests when they nest inside a food plant, warehouse, mall or atrium. The birds cause damage by pecking at rigid foam insulation in buildings and nesting inside traffic lights. They are a factor in the transmission of a number of diseases, internal parasites and ectoparasites. Other birds. Other birds, from hawks to swallows, may occasionally cause unexpected and unusual pest problems or serve as reservoirs of disease organisms. When blackbirds and crows roost in suburban areas they become pests. Woodpeckers can \"hammer\" into house siding looking for insects. Seagulls can feed at food plants, landfills, etc. Many of these birds are more protected by laws and regulations than are the three species discussed previously. The survey should document both the target and nontarget species involved, census the target population and identify bird status as resident, migrant, adult or juvenile. Habitat modification. Habitat modification for birds means limiting a bird's food, water or shelter, which for pigeons, starlings and house sparrows is not practical as these birds will have a number of feeding and watering sites often far from roosting and loafing areas. Where people are feeding birds in parks or lunch areas, education can help reduce this source of food; but in most cases people will pay little attention to requests to stop. Pigeons, but not sparrows or starlings, may be induced to move by the persistent destruction of nests and eggs. Flat ledges, openings in water towers and vents, unscreened windows, and other attributes make a building an attractive location for roosting, nesting and loafing. Modification or repair can exclude birds. The following specific measures should be considered because the birds are not killed and the control is comparatively long-lasting. If aesthetics are important, these devices can be limited to areas where they cannot be easily seen. Covers or ramps custom-designed for ledges, window air-conditioning units and roof edges keep birds from infesting these sites. This is costly but valid where limited application will keep birds off selected sites and where aesthetics are an important consideration. Tacky gels and liquids are designed to be sticky enough to make a bird uncomfortable, but not so sticky that the birds are trapped. Trapping. Where a group of birds is roosting or feeding in a confined and isolated area, trapping should be considered the primary control tactic, preferably in the winter when food availability is at a minimum. Most pigeon-trapping programs use large walk-in traps (4 to 6 feet high) designed to be disassembled and moved, or low-profile traps (8 to 24 inches high). Traps are set in inconspicuous places where pigeons commonly roost or feed and where traps are not likely to be vandalized (a major risk in trapping programs). Baits of whole corn or sorghum are generally best, but wheat, milo, oat groats, millet, popcorn, sunflower seeds, peas, greens, bread or peanuts can be very effective. At the beginning of a program, scatter small quantities of bait and some decoys to start the birds feeding and determine the best trap sites. In most cases, trapped birds should be humanely destroyed. Fine cracked corn, millet, wheat or bread crumbs make good bait. Nest-box traps attract a sparrow with a potential nest site. Once inside, the bird trips the mechanism, which dumps it into a collecting bag. This trap also works against starlings, as does the center drop trap, in which birds attracted by food drop through an opening and cannot escape. Only 5 percent to 15 percent of the flock needs to be affected as the rest of the birds will become frightened, causing most to leave the area . Birds must be trained to feed on baits as they can be very wary under some circumstances. While baits are different for each bird, the general process is the same. An appropriate treatment would be 20 piles of bait on a flat 5,000-square-foot roof. Do not use these treatments where nontarget birds fed on the pre-bait unless the site is one of many. However, this also increases the number and visibility of impacted birds. With good bait acceptance, a ratio of 1:29 (treated:untreated) will generally kill about 5 percent of the flock; a 1:9 blend will generally kill 15 percent or more. The objective is to relocate the flock, not kill every pigeon. For example, if 8 pounds of pre-bait have been set out each day for a flock of about 100 birds, 4 pounds of the treated blended bait should be set out when switched over. If a site has been getting monthly maintenance baiting, pigeons can become extremely bait-shy. Use care to follow directions for using chemicals specifically for each species of pest bird. If a dead or dying bird has a supply of treated bait in its crop there is potential risk to an animal feeding on this bird. Birds have poorly developed senses of taste and smell. Therefore, birds tend to reject new and different food. Consequently, the best bait is a food (fresh) the birds are accustomed to consuming. For example, if starlings are accustomed to feeding on food scraps at a dump, cracked corn is a poor bait selection. Conversely, if starlings are accustomed to feeding on cracked corn in and around a mill, food scraps may not be readily accepted. Placement should be on a site where the birds are accustomed to feeding — if safe and practical. Place baits at a time when the birds cannot observe the baiting activity, or if not possible, use the same person and routine each time. For example, whole kernel corn when used as bait will greatly reduce the hazard to small sparrowlike birds, providing, of course, that there are not kernel fragments in the whole kernel corn. Or, as another example, the use of meat scraps or bread as a bait may reduce the hazard to seed-eating birds. For example, the baiting of sparrows inside a structure poses a hazard to no other birds. Sometimes the baiting of flat roof-tops for pigeons can be used to reduce the hazard to nontarget birds. Chemosterilants. Often called \"birth control pills,\" these are used to control pigeons by inhibition of ovulation in the female and sperm production in the male. When applied as directed on the label, these materials will not kill birds, but populations will slowly decline over the years from the natural mortality in an aging pigeon population. Most birds eating chemosterilants will be temporarily sterilized, so care must be taken to avoid feeding nontarget species. Most lethal tactics in bird control pose some risk to nontarget birds, as well as other animals. People often react more negatively to one dying bird than to accumulated pigeon droppings on sidewalks or potential risks of parasites and disease from bird roosts. Pigeons and sparrows are seen as pets rather than pests. The public's perception of bird-management operations needs to be considered. All bird-management programs should put some effort into avoiding \"people problems\" — particularly when using toxic control techniques. Other animals (such as skunks, raccoons, opossums and, in Hawaii, mongooses) become pests when they wander into residential areas from nearby wild areas or parks. Some have taken to living along with people — next to or sometimes inside buildings. These pests must sometimes be controlled. Because they are often game animals or are otherwise protected, most control actions will be nonlethal. A thin membrane of skin stretches from the long modified front legs to the back legs and then to the tail. In the Southwest, some species pollinate cactus. Many species have protected status. Those that most often become a problem live in colonies or groups, such as little brown bats and big brown bats. By far, raccoons account for the largest percentage of animal rabies cases reported. Depending on the species and geographic location, they breed from late spring to midsummer, giving birth to only one or two young. Bang on the walls and listen for squeaks and scratches as roosting bats are disturbed. They look like mouse droppings, except they contain wings, legs and other body parts of insects and often accumulate to a depth of several inches or more. June and July are peak months for bat complaints in much of the country. Unfortunately, that is the worst time of the year for control because they are rearing young in their colonies. Seal all but one or two principal openings and hang bird netting over the remaining exits to act as a \"bat valve.\" Many species (Sciurus spp.) The most common species that become pests are the gray squirrel, red squirrel, flying squirrel and fox squirrel. They like to gnaw on wires. The legal status of squirrels varies greatly with geographic area and species. Many are classified as game animals. Good baits include peanuts, nutmeats, peanut butter, whole corn, sunflower seeds or rolled oats. Squirrels are nasty biters and should be handled carefully. If they are released, do so at least 5 miles away in unpopulated areas so that they do not return. Both ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and chipmunks (Tamias spp.) are active during the day and are easily seen when foraging. But they spend much of their time in their burrows. Ground squirrels are primarily vegetarians, feeding on grasses. Chipmunks eat both plant and animal material, from seeds, nuts, insects and worms to songbirds and frogs. Because squirrels can carry disease, check state and local laws regarding their release at some new location. Place traps near burrow entrances or runs and bait with nuts, oats, barley or melon rind. Only rarely do chipmunks become a serious pest problem. Simply altering the habitat may cause the chipmunks to move. Live trapping and relocating chipmunks (where permitted) is considered a humane method of control. Effective baits include peanut butter, nuts, sunflower seeds, oats, bacon and apple slices. Traps should be placed at den entrances and baited with apple slices or perhaps with some peanut butter. Seeds and nuts should not be used because they will attract ground-dwelling birds. These vertebrates are considered together because they are similar pests with similar management and control recommendations. Management of these animals almost always involves exclusion and/or live trapping. Skunks (Mephitis spp.) are nocturnal. They do not hibernate but may sleep through cold weather periods. They usually live in underground burrows, hollow logs or rock piles. They may decide to live under houses, decks, sheds, cabins or storage buildings. Another major problem in some areas of the country is the transmission of rabies and skunks' documented involvement with West Nile virus. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are common throughout North America. They are easy to recognize with their black face mask and ringed, bushy tail. They have long, thick fur with a thin muzzle and pointed ears. Their feet are well-adapted to climbing. They are large animals, weighing between 10 and 25 pounds. Their senses of hearing, sight and touch are well-developed, while those of taste and smell are not. They are commonly found near streams, lakes and swamps, and they often do quite well in suburban areas and even in city parks. Mostly active at night, raccoons may be seen at dawn or dusk and sometimes even in the middle of the day. They may be encountered at latrine and picnic sites. Raccoons feed on animals and plants. In the spring and summer, they feed on crayfish, mussels, frogs, and fish. They also eat mice, squirrels, and birds, and are quite happy knocking over a garbage can. Raccoons can transmit rabies. West Nile virus has been detected in raccoons. Opossums, which are related to kangaroos, are the only North American marsupials. The opossum is a whitish or grayish animal the size of a house cat with a naked, ratlike tail. Its face is long and pointed with rounded, hairless ears. It grows up to 40 inches long and can weigh up to 14 pounds. The average is 6 to 7 pounds for males and 4 pounds for females. Opossum tracks look as if they were made by little human or monkey hands. Opossums prefer to live near streams or swamps. They eat nearly everything, from insects to carrion, fruits to grains, and garbage to pet food. Opossums are active at night. Their mating season is January to July, and they may raise two to three litters per year. Opossums move slowly. When threatened, opossums climb trees or go down into burrows. If cornered, they may growl, hiss, bite, screech and exude a smelly green fluid from their rear end. They have the reputation of being stupid, but scientists consider them to be smarter than domestic dogs. The main complaint against opossums is that they get into garbage, bird feeders or pet food left outside. Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) are found on all the major islands of Hawaii except Kauai and extend from sea level to 10,000-foot elevations. Females usually produce two litters of two between February and November. Mongooses forage only during the day, primarily on small animals and insects, but they are omnivorous and will eat whatever is available or travel up to a mile to get food. They dig up lawns for grubs and enter homes to get at garbage-filled trash bags. When excluding animals in spring or early summer, be aware that young may also be present. Some areas prohibit releasing trapped animals, especially skunks and raccoons, because they carry rabies. If the animal is to be released, do it far away from human dwellings. Use what you have learned about the biology of the animal to find a suitable habitat. The release site for these large animals should be more than 10 miles away. There is obviously a special problem when trapping skunks. The best baits for skunks are chicken parts and entrails, fresh fish, cat food, sardines and eggs; for raccoon, chicken parts and entrails, corn, fresh fish and sardines; for opossum, apple slices, chicken parts and entrails, fresh fish and sardines. The best preventive measure for skunks, raccoons, opossums and mongooses is to establish a good level of sanitation in a neighborhood. Remind clients that released vertebrates must fight their way into new territory to establish themselves and that overcrowded habitat results in increased risk of disease and marginal resting sites. Most snakes are nonpoisonous, harmless and beneficial. But few people want them in their homes. In general, a poisonous snake has a large triangular head, a pit between the eye and nostril, and vertical, elliptical pupils. It may also have rattles on its tail and noticeable fangs. When unsure, assume that the snake may be poisonous. Snakes are predators. Depending on the species, their diet may include insects, rodents, frogs, birds, worms, or toads. At certain times of the year, they may enter buildings for warmth, shade or moisture, or in search of prey. When managing a snake problem, keep in mind that the snake may be a protected species. Often, snake problems follow rodent problems. Mow grass short to expose rodent runs. The snake and bags can be lifted with a shovel and taken outside. Captured snakes may be killed or released. Before release, pour vegetable oil over the snake and glue to loosen it. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The northern mockingbird is listed as of least concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence. A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans, particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats. Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years. Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior. The mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture. of animals and birds can be encountered. Porcupines, golden jackals and wild boars are familiar sights. Foxes and striped hyenas are present although very rare to see. Birds of prey such as buzzards are frequently found roaming the skies looking for wood mice, snakes or moles. The griffon vulture is present and with no human interference to its nesting areas. Passerine birds like goldfinch (حسون), swallows (سنونو), house sparrows (دوري), hoopoes (هدهد) and many more flourish in the village’s trees and gardens. During the day bulbuls are often heard singing. Chukars (حجل) are also found and can be hunted for sports. The herons are a widespread family with a cosmopolitan distribution. They exist on all continents except Antarctica and are present in most habitats except the coldest extremes of the Arctic, extremely high mountains, and the driest deserts. Almost all species are associated with water; they are essentially non-swimming waterbirds that feed on the margins of lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and the sea. They are predominantly found in lowland areas, although some species live in alpine areas, and the majority of species occur in the tropics. The herons are a highly mobile family, with most species being at least partially migratory; for example, the grey heron is mostly sedentary in Britain, but mostly migratory in Scandinavia. Birds are particularly inclined to disperse widely after breeding, but before the annual migration, where the species is colonial, searching out new feeding areas and reducing the pressures on feeding grounds near the colony. The migration typically occurs at night, usually as individuals or in small groups. slightly duller, has variable amounts of gray to the head (often virtually none), a yellowish eye ring and a yellowish stripe from the bill to the eye. There are significant racial variations in the male plumage (see Taxonomy). This species is easily distinguished from wintering common yellowthroat by its uniform yellow underparts, whereas the North American bird has a white belly. The masked yellowthroat is usually seen in pairs, and does not associate with other species. It is often skulking, but may pop up occasionally, especially to sing. It feeds on insects, including caterpillars, which are usually captured in dense vegetation. The call is a fast chattering, quite unlike that of other yellowthroat species, and a more typical sharp chip. This species may be spreading in Central America due to deforestation.\n\nQuestion: what is the name for a group of jackdaws\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Many vertebrate animals expose humans to dangerous pathogens that have public-health significance. Other chapters deal with specific arthropods that transmit disease organisms to humans. This chapter deals with vertebrates that expose humans to disease organisms without benefit of an arthropod vector or that are primary reservoirs of organisms that cause important human disease. Included are domestic (house mouse, rat) and wild or sylvan rodents. These rodents can infect humans directly with diseases such as tularemia, leptospirosis, arenavirus, hantavirus, ratbite fever, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and salmonellosis (food poisoning). They also may serve as reservoirs for diseases transmitted by ectoparasites, such as tick-borne relapsing fever, Colorado tick fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, plague, murine typhus, rickettsial pox, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and tularemia. Birds, bats and small mammals can be carriers of rabies, histoplasmosis, listeriosis or leptospirosis. Commensal (domestic or urban) and sylvan (wild) rodents occasionally are targeted for control measures. Three species of urban rodents, Mus musculus (house mouse), Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and Rattus rattus (roof rat), create the principal rodent problems. Rats. The Norway rat (synonymous with brown, dump, barn, sewer, gray or wharf rat) is a burrowing rodent. The Norway rat has a blunt muzzle, small eyes and short, close-set ears. Its fur is coarse and usually brownish- or reddish-gray, with whitish-gray hair on the belly. Its nearly naked, scaly tail is dark on the top and light on the underside and is shorter (6 to 8½ inches) than the combined length of the head and body (7 to 10 inches). Adults weigh 12 to 18 ounces. They are good climbers and can reach a distance of 13 inches while standing on the ground and jump 24 inches vertically. The Norway rat has relatively poor vision but keen senses of smell, touch, taste and hearing. The sense of touch is served by long whiskers on the snout. They feed on virtually anything edible. Gnawing marks. Recent gnawings on wood are light in color, darkening with age. Droppings. Pet excitement. A smooth patch of flour or talc laid down in a runway may show activity. In addition to rodent signs, accessibility of food and harborage indicates relative population potential and environmental factors favorable for rodent infestations. In instances of plague or murine typhus, a program to control ectoparasites should precede or accompany rodent control, especially in urban or other densely populated areas and high-use recreational areas in the West. Blocking rodent access is a major factor in rodent control. Rats, for example, can gain entrance through openings larger than ½ inch square; mice require only ¼ inch. Conversely, they often enter buildings whose doors are left open for long periods. Steel wool, lath screen and copper mesh are materials that can be packed tightly into holes to close openings or protect other areas from gnawing. Sewers are inhabited by Norway rats in some cities and towns. Because Norway rats are excellent swimmers, water traps do not impede their movement. The problem of rats in sewers is usually greatest in places where sanitary sewers are interconnected with storm sewers, thus providing multiple entry points. The domestic sewer of an average community provides enough food to sustain a large number of rats, a problem that has increased with the advent of garbage-disposal units. Blackberry brush, for example, is a common harborage for rats. Within buildings, stairways, cabinets, lockers, machinery, double walls, false ceilings and floors, boxed-in pipes, and conduits may serve as shelter and nesting and breeding sites. Trapping. Trapping has several advantages. It does not rely on inherently hazardous rodenticides, and it permits users to view their success. These traps are designed to catch and hold one or more animals by means of a falling or sliding door, triggered when the rodent enters or nibbles at a bait. Effective trapping of commensal rodents depends on an understanding of basic behavioral traits. For example, Norway rats, while as agile as tree squirrels when necessary, are more at home on the ground and will normally be caught there, whereas roof rats are fond of climbing and can be taken more frequently from their runs along pipes and supporting beams. Mice are much more inquisitive than rats and will investigate a newly placed trap, whereas rats are apt to avoid it. Ketch-All type traps, wire live traps and snap traps designed only for mice are not considered dangerous, although they may bruise the fingers of a child. Bait selection and placement. Bait boxes should be clearly labeled \"Rat Bait\" or \"Mouse Bait,\" as the case may be. Examine paraffin- bait blocks for signs of rodent gnawing. Rodents have food preferences. Norway rats accept cereals, fruit, nuts, vegetables, meats and fish, but roof rats do not readily eat meat or fish. Rodenticides. When they consume a sublethal amount of an acute toxicant, bait shyness may result. Therefore, bait shyness is not a problem. The powder adheres to the rodents' feet and fur and is consumed during grooming. Rodent competition. There is some competition between commensal rodents. Partial separation between rats and mice occurs, for example, in grain stacks where house mice feed in the lower areas and rats in upper portions. Upon direct confrontation, rats will kill mice. Resistance to rodenticides. When a rodent population has a rather high number of individuals that are less susceptible to a rodenticide, resistance becomes a concern. Pest control operators should constantly be aware of resistance as a source of control failures. Consider all rodenticides dangerous, and place baits where only rodents can get them. Handle the carcasses with tongs or rubber gloves. Health risks from birds are often exaggerated. Nevertheless, large populations of roosting birds may present risks of disease to people nearby. Food may be contaminated by birds, but this risk is usually limited to food manufacturing or processing plants. Cryptococcosis can result from pigeon droppings, which appear to be the most important source of the disease fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans. Like histoplasmosis, outbreaks of this disease often occur after building renovation, roost clean-up or other actions that disturb the old droppings. Other diseases carried or transmitted by birds affect humans to a lesser degree. Psittacosis, pigeon ornithosis and toxoplasmosis are normally mild in humans; however, serious illness or death can occur in rare cases. Pigeons and sparrows have also been implicated (along with many other species of birds) in outbreaks of encephalitis. Ectoparasites of pigeons, starlings and house sparrows can invade buildings. Some of these parasites bite and irritate humans. With very few exceptions, all birds are protected by one or more federal laws and regulations. Pigeons, starlings and house sparrows are not directly protected at the federal level, but applications of toxicants or repellents must be made according to the product label and under the restrictions that apply under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). State and local regulations may require permits or restrict actions taken against pest birds. Pigeons. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) developed from the rock doves of Europe and Asia and was introduced into the U.S. as a domestic bird. Rock doves originally nested in caves, holes and under overhanging rocks on cliffs, so they comfortably adapt to window ledges, roofs, eaves, steeples and other components of man-made structures. Although primarily seed or grain eaters, in urban areas pigeons feed on garbage, spilled grains, insects, food left by outdoor diners and food provided by bird lovers who intentionally feed pigeons. Pigeons are gregarious. When not feeding or mating, most of their day is spent cooing, preening and sunbathing. Pigeons prefer flat and smooth surfaces on which to rest and feed, and, unlike most birds, they will feed from rooftops, regardless of height, because they like openness that permits a speedy escape. Building roofs and ledges, cooling towers, bridges and signs are typical roosting and loafing sites. Feeding sites include parks, squares, food loading docks, garbage areas, railroad sidings, food plants and wherever people eat outdoors. Male pigeons are sexually mature at three to four months of age, females at six months. They mate for life unless separated by death or accident. After pairing and mating, nest construction begins in protected openings in or on buildings and structures. They share incubation responsibilities for the one or two eggs produced, the male from midmorning through afternoon and the female the rest of the day and evening. Adult birds can mate again while the young are still in the nest. Pigeons nest during all seasons when conditions permit. Nests that are continually used become solid with droppings, feathers, debris and sometimes dead birds. Starlings. Starlings are robin-sized birds that weigh about 3 ounces. They nest in holes or cavities in trees or rocks, in urban areas on buildings, in birdhouses, and on power stations, water towers and other structures. Both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the young, which leave the nest when they are about three weeks old. Starlings migrate in some parts of the country. The major sources of food shift from insects and fruits to grains, seeds, livestock rations and garbage. Each starling eats about an ounce of food daily. Instead of flying straight into the roosts when returning just before sundown, they \"stage\" on high perches such as trees, power lines, bridges, and towers. The birds are quite social at these times and remain on pre-roost sites until after sunset, singing and calling to one another. Starlings are pests because of their high numbers. Thousands or tens of thousands can roost at one site. The birds are noisy, consume large quantities of livestock feed and contaminate water at stockyards. House sparrows. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus), also called the English sparrow, was introduced into the U.S. in the 1850s. While sparrows are still one of the most common birds, their numbers have fallen drastically since the 1920s when food and waste from horses furnished unlimited food. Breeding can occur in any month throughout much of the country but is most common from March through August. Eggs are incubated for about two weeks, and the young stay in the nest another two weeks. Nests, bulky and roofed over, are located in trees and shrubs, on building ledges, in signs, on light fixtures and under bridges. Sparrows are aggressive and social birds, often outcompeting native species. They have no recognized migration patterns and will stay in an area as long as food and nest sites are available. Young birds, however, move out of an area to establish new territories in flocks of juvenile birds and nonbreeding adults that may travel four or five miles from nest sites to feeding areas. Sparrows are very tolerant of human activity and will not hesitate to set up housekeeping in high-traffic areas. They feed preferentially on grain and also on fruits, seeds and garbage, and can be pests in many situations. Sparrows also can become pests when they nest inside a food plant, warehouse, mall or atrium. The birds cause damage by pecking at rigid foam insulation in buildings and nesting inside traffic lights. They are a factor in the transmission of a number of diseases, internal parasites and ectoparasites. Other birds. Other birds, from hawks to swallows, may occasionally cause unexpected and unusual pest problems or serve as reservoirs of disease organisms. When blackbirds and crows roost in suburban areas they become pests. Woodpeckers can \"hammer\" into house siding looking for insects. Seagulls can feed at food plants, landfills, etc. Many of these birds are more protected by laws and regulations than are the three species discussed previously. The survey should document both the target and nontarget species involved, census the target population and identify bird status as resident, migrant, adult or juvenile. Habitat modification. Habitat modification for birds means limiting a bird's food, water or shelter, which for pigeons, starlings and house sparrows is not practical as these birds will have a number of feeding and watering sites often far from roosting and loafing areas. Where people are feeding birds in parks or lunch areas, education can help reduce this source of food; but in most cases people will pay little attention to requests to stop. Pigeons, but not sparrows or starlings, may be induced to move by the persistent destruction of nests and eggs. Flat ledges, openings in water towers and vents, unscreened windows, and other attributes make a building an attractive location for roosting, nesting and loafing. Modification or repair can exclude birds. The following specific measures should be considered because the birds are not killed and the control is comparatively long-lasting. If aesthetics are important, these devices can be limited to areas where they cannot be easily seen. Covers or ramps custom-designed for ledges, window air-conditioning units and roof edges keep birds from infesting these sites. This is costly but valid where limited application will keep birds off selected sites and where aesthetics are an important consideration. Tacky gels and liquids are designed to be sticky enough to make a bird uncomfortable, but not so sticky that the birds are trapped. Trapping. Where a group of birds is roosting or feeding in a confined and isolated area, trapping should be considered the primary control tactic, preferably in the winter when food availability is at a minimum. Most pigeon-trapping programs use large walk-in traps (4 to 6 feet high) designed to be disassembled and moved, or low-profile traps (8 to 24 inches high). Traps are set in inconspicuous places where pigeons commonly roost or feed and where traps are not likely to be vandalized (a major risk in trapping programs). Baits of whole corn or sorghum are generally best, but wheat, milo, oat groats, millet, popcorn, sunflower seeds, peas, greens, bread or peanuts can be very effective. At the beginning of a program, scatter small quantities of bait and some decoys to start the birds feeding and determine the best trap sites. In most cases, trapped birds should be humanely destroyed. Fine cracked corn, millet, wheat or bread crumbs make good bait. Nest-box traps attract a sparrow with a potential nest site. Once inside, the bird trips the mechanism, which dumps it into a collecting bag. This trap also works against starlings, as does the center drop trap, in which birds attracted by food drop through an opening and cannot escape. Only 5 percent to 15 percent of the flock needs to be affected as the rest of the birds will become frightened, causing most to leave the area . Birds must be trained to feed on baits as they can be very wary under some circumstances. While baits are different for each bird, the general process is the same. An appropriate treatment would be 20 piles of bait on a flat 5,000-square-foot roof. Do not use these treatments where nontarget birds fed on the pre-bait unless the site is one of many. However, this also increases the number and visibility of impacted birds. With good bait acceptance, a ratio of 1:29 (treated:untreated) will generally kill about 5 percent of the flock; a 1:9 blend will generally kill 15 percent or more. The objective is to relocate the flock, not kill every pigeon. For example, if 8 pounds of pre-bait have been set out each day for a flock of about 100 birds, 4 pounds of the treated blended bait should be set out when switched over. If a site has been getting monthly maintenance baiting, pigeons can become extremely bait-shy. Use care to follow directions for using chemicals specifically for each species of pest bird. If a dead or dying bird has a supply of treated bait in its crop there is potential risk to an animal feeding on this bird. Birds have poorly developed senses of taste and smell. Therefore, birds tend to reject new and different food. Consequently, the best bait is a food (fresh) the birds are accustomed to consuming. For example, if starlings are accustomed to feeding on food scraps at a dump, cracked corn is a poor bait selection. Conversely, if starlings are accustomed to feeding on cracked corn in and around a mill, food scraps may not be readily accepted. Placement should be on a site where the birds are accustomed to feeding — if safe and practical. Place baits at a time when the birds cannot observe the baiting activity, or if not possible, use the same person and routine each time. For example, whole kernel corn when used as bait will greatly reduce the hazard to small sparrowlike birds, providing, of course, that there are not kernel fragments in the whole kernel corn. Or, as another example, the use of meat scraps or bread as a bait may reduce the hazard to seed-eating birds. For example, the baiting of sparrows inside a structure poses a hazard to no other birds. Sometimes the baiting of flat roof-tops for pigeons can be used to reduce the hazard to nontarget birds. Chemosterilants. Often called \"birth control pills,\" these are used to control pigeons by inhibition of ovulation in the female and sperm production in the male. When applied as directed on the label, these materials will not kill birds, but populations will slowly decline over the years from the natural mortality in an aging pigeon population. Most birds eating chemosterilants will be temporarily sterilized, so care must be taken to avoid feeding nontarget species. Most lethal tactics in bird control pose some risk to nontarget birds, as well as other animals. People often react more negatively to one dying bird than to accumulated pigeon droppings on sidewalks or potential risks of parasites and disease from bird roosts. Pigeons and sparrows are seen as pets rather than pests. The public's perception of bird-management operations needs to be considered. All bird-management programs should put some effort into avoiding \"people problems\" — particularly when using toxic control techniques. Other animals (such as skunks, raccoons, opossums and, in Hawaii, mongooses) become pests when they wander into residential areas from nearby wild areas or parks. Some have taken to living along with people — next to or sometimes inside buildings. These pests must sometimes be controlled. Because they are often game animals or are otherwise protected, most control actions will be nonlethal. A thin membrane of skin stretches from the long modified front legs to the back legs and then to the tail. In the Southwest, some species pollinate cactus. Many species have protected status. Those that most often become a problem live in colonies or groups, such as little brown bats and big brown bats. By far, raccoons account for the largest percentage of animal rabies cases reported. Depending on the species and geographic location, they breed from late spring to midsummer, giving birth to only one or two young. Bang on the walls and listen for squeaks and scratches as roosting bats are disturbed. They look like mouse droppings, except they contain wings, legs and other body parts of insects and often accumulate to a depth of several inches or more. June and July are peak months for bat complaints in much of the country. Unfortunately, that is the worst time of the year for control because they are rearing young in their colonies. Seal all but one or two principal openings and hang bird netting over the remaining exits to act as a \"bat valve.\" Many species (Sciurus spp.) The most common species that become pests are the gray squirrel, red squirrel, flying squirrel and fox squirrel. They like to gnaw on wires. The legal status of squirrels varies greatly with geographic area and species. Many are classified as game animals. Good baits include peanuts, nutmeats, peanut butter, whole corn, sunflower seeds or rolled oats. Squirrels are nasty biters and should be handled carefully. If they are released, do so at least 5 miles away in unpopulated areas so that they do not return. Both ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and chipmunks (Tamias spp.) are active during the day and are easily seen when foraging. But they spend much of their time in their burrows. Ground squirrels are primarily vegetarians, feeding on grasses. Chipmunks eat both plant and animal material, from seeds, nuts, insects and worms to songbirds and frogs. Because squirrels can carry disease, check state and local laws regarding their release at some new location. Place traps near burrow entrances or runs and bait with nuts, oats, barley or melon rind. Only rarely do chipmunks become a serious pest problem. Simply altering the habitat may cause the chipmunks to move. Live trapping and relocating chipmunks (where permitted) is considered a humane method of control. Effective baits include peanut butter, nuts, sunflower seeds, oats, bacon and apple slices. Traps should be placed at den entrances and baited with apple slices or perhaps with some peanut butter. Seeds and nuts should not be used because they will attract ground-dwelling birds. These vertebrates are considered together because they are similar pests with similar management and control recommendations. Management of these animals almost always involves exclusion and/or live trapping. Skunks (Mephitis spp.) are nocturnal. They do not hibernate but may sleep through cold weather periods. They usually live in underground burrows, hollow logs or rock piles. They may decide to live under houses, decks, sheds, cabins or storage buildings. Another major problem in some areas of the country is the transmission of rabies and skunks' documented involvement with West Nile virus. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are common throughout North America. They are easy to recognize with their black face mask and ringed, bushy tail. They have long, thick fur with a thin muzzle and pointed ears. Their feet are well-adapted to climbing. They are large animals, weighing between 10 and 25 pounds. Their senses of hearing, sight and touch are well-developed, while those of taste and smell are not. They are commonly found near streams, lakes and swamps, and they often do quite well in suburban areas and even in city parks. Mostly active at night, raccoons may be seen at dawn or dusk and sometimes even in the middle of the day. They may be encountered at latrine and picnic sites. Raccoons feed on animals and plants. In the spring and summer, they feed on crayfish, mussels, frogs, and fish. They also eat mice, squirrels, and birds, and are quite happy knocking over a garbage can. Raccoons can transmit rabies. West Nile virus has been detected in raccoons. Opossums, which are related to kangaroos, are the only North American marsupials. The opossum is a whitish or grayish animal the size of a house cat with a naked, ratlike tail. Its face is long and pointed with rounded, hairless ears. It grows up to 40 inches long and can weigh up to 14 pounds. The average is 6 to 7 pounds for males and 4 pounds for females. Opossum tracks look as if they were made by little human or monkey hands. Opossums prefer to live near streams or swamps. They eat nearly everything, from insects to carrion, fruits to grains, and garbage to pet food. Opossums are active at night. Their mating season is January to July, and they may raise two to three litters per year. Opossums move slowly. When threatened, opossums climb trees or go down into burrows. If cornered, they may growl, hiss, bite, screech and exude a smelly green fluid from their rear end. They have the reputation of being stupid, but scientists consider them to be smarter than domestic dogs. The main complaint against opossums is that they get into garbage, bird feeders or pet food left outside. Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) are found on all the major islands of Hawaii except Kauai and extend from sea level to 10,000-foot elevations. Females usually produce two litters of two between February and November. Mongooses forage only during the day, primarily on small animals and insects, but they are omnivorous and will eat whatever is available or travel up to a mile to get food. They dig up lawns for grubs and enter homes to get at garbage-filled trash bags. When excluding animals in spring or early summer, be aware that young may also be present. Some areas prohibit releasing trapped animals, especially skunks and raccoons, because they carry rabies. If the animal is to be released, do it far away from human dwellings. Use what you have learned about the biology of the animal to find a suitable habitat. The release site for these large animals should be more than 10 miles away. There is obviously a special problem when trapping skunks. The best baits for skunks are chicken parts and entrails, fresh fish, cat food, sardines and eggs; for raccoon, chicken parts and entrails, corn, fresh fish and sardines; for opossum, apple slices, chicken parts and entrails, fresh fish and sardines. The best preventive measure for skunks, raccoons, opossums and mongooses is to establish a good level of sanitation in a neighborhood. Remind clients that released vertebrates must fight their way into new territory to establish themselves and that overcrowded habitat results in increased risk of disease and marginal resting sites. Most snakes are nonpoisonous, harmless and beneficial. But few people want them in their homes. In general, a poisonous snake has a large triangular head, a pit between the eye and nostril, and vertical, elliptical pupils. It may also have rattles on its tail and noticeable fangs. When unsure, assume that the snake may be poisonous. Snakes are predators. Depending on the species, their diet may include insects, rodents, frogs, birds, worms, or toads. At certain times of the year, they may enter buildings for warmth, shade or moisture, or in search of prey. When managing a snake problem, keep in mind that the snake may be a protected species. Often, snake problems follow rodent problems. Mow grass short to expose rodent runs. The snake and bags can be lifted with a shovel and taken outside. Captured snakes may be killed or released. Before release, pour vegetable oil over the snake and glue to loosen it. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The northern mockingbird is listed as of least concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence. A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans, particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats. Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years. Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior. The mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture. of animals and birds can be encountered. Porcupines, golden jackals and wild boars are familiar sights. Foxes and striped hyenas are present although very rare to see. Birds of prey such as buzzards are frequently found roaming the skies looking for wood mice, snakes or moles. The griffon vulture is present and with no human interference to its nesting areas. Passerine birds like goldfinch (حسون), swallows (سنونو), house sparrows (دوري), hoopoes (هدهد) and many more flourish in the village’s trees and gardens. During the day bulbuls are often heard singing. Chukars (حجل) are also found and can be hunted for sports. The herons are a widespread family with a cosmopolitan distribution. They exist on all continents except Antarctica and are present in most habitats except the coldest extremes of the Arctic, extremely high mountains, and the driest deserts. Almost all species are associated with water; they are essentially non-swimming waterbirds that feed on the margins of lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and the sea. They are predominantly found in lowland areas, although some species live in alpine areas, and the majority of species occur in the tropics. The herons are a highly mobile family, with most species being at least partially migratory; for example, the grey heron is mostly sedentary in Britain, but mostly migratory in Scandinavia. Birds are particularly inclined to disperse widely after breeding, but before the annual migration, where the species is colonial, searching out new feeding areas and reducing the pressures on feeding grounds near the colony. The migration typically occurs at night, usually as individuals or in small groups. slightly duller, has variable amounts of gray to the head (often virtually none), a yellowish eye ring and a yellowish stripe from the bill to the eye. There are significant racial variations in the male plumage (see Taxonomy). This species is easily distinguished from wintering common yellowthroat by its uniform yellow underparts, whereas the North American bird has a white belly. The masked yellowthroat is usually seen in pairs, and does not associate with other species. It is often skulking, but may pop up occasionally, especially to sing. It feeds on insects, including caterpillars, which are usually captured in dense vegetation. The call is a fast chattering, quite unlike that of other yellowthroat species, and a more typical sharp chip. This species may be spreading in Central America due to deforestation.\n\n"

I slept in my clothes. I forgot about clean hair or basic hygiene. I just didn’t care how I looked or how I smelled. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was getting a firsthand remedial course in correcting those misconceptions about depression. It’s what mental health professionals call an adjustment disorder that can strike within weeks following a traumatic life event as we struggle to make sense of something that makes no sense. At the extreme, people with depression may harm themselves. Also, important brain chemicals called neurotransmitters appear to be out of balance. FACT: Depression is debilitating. Most people with the disorder will require treatment to get better. But it can also mean physical symptoms such as chest pain, queasiness or nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, sleep problems, exhaustion, and changes in weight or appetite. Dr. Khatri adds that many middle-aged women today are also often caring for both their own children and elderly parents, thus increasing stress levels which in turn can lead to depression. It has an end. – perhaps I wouldn’t have suffered needlessly for as long as I did before seeking professional help. I was getting used to using a walker because of balance problems, so I decided these were exceptionally severe muscle pains, moaned and whimpered as quietly as I could and kept popping Tylenol extra-strength for arthritis. Friday I went to a wedding, Sunday I went to church, and Monday morning I woke up with the same pain. Unpredictable bursting into tears–terribly embarrassing. I can relate (I too have popped out two children the old-fashioned way, and I once spent a month in hospital following a ruptured appendix and peritonitis!) Which is to say: you and I know our pain! Is that common, by any chance, or is it more likely that a myriad of personal factors specific to my life in particular triggered that instead? It’s impossible to tell if it’s the date circled on the calendar or, as you say, just personal factors going on in life that can impact these “rough patches”. Ah, that’s good to know. What’s that famous quotation about “life is what happens when we’re busy making other plans!”? I belong to a women’s group and one of our friends is severely depressed and pulled away from all of us. You are so right, you just don’t pull yourself up. Thank you for putting it in simpler terms what is happening to our friend. I plunged into such a depression. It was just as you describe… I had no motivation to do anything. What was the point? I was waiting for that proverbial other shoe to drop. The turning point seems to be when we are able to do something – ANYTHING! – even when we don’t want to, and when we can finally say, as you did: “I started to believe I just might survive!” Congratulations – You made it!! I thought I was coping and making rational decisions. Apparently, I was not. We are not always told what to expect and depression is one of the “biggies”. Life is good and I am one happy, contributing lady. Your own story is an excellent cautionary tale, i.e. Brava!! Instead, I’m ashamed to say, I took out all my frustrations on my nearest and dearest, who bore it all quietly for awhile – and then sat me down and read me the riot act, i.e. “you’re being very self-indulgent. Just wondering if anger was/is part of depression? Doesn’t sound like it, but who knows? My husband’s theory is that all that rage, directed at dietary changes, allowed me to vent about “the injustice” of what happened – and then get on with adjusting to it. I marched around the apartment one day gathering up all the bouquets of flowers and get-well cards that had been arriving – and trashed the lot of them. I was annoyed by the appearance that some kind of sick person lived here! Good luck with minimizing the histrionics! I was relatively fit, only about 10 lbs above my ideal weight, ate sensibly and didn’t smoke. I would look at obese people eating fast food and smoking and I’m ashamed to say that I thought, why me and not them!? I also have the attitude of “so what”. Hello Pam – you have touched on an under-appreciated element of this kind of depression: the disconcerting change in our very personality. I’ve quoted her writing often here because, although these are of course different diagnoses, the similarities with heart disease are striking. For example: Could ‘Goodism’ and Self-Sacrifice be Linked to Women’s Heart Disease Outcomes? Look, I KNOW that other people have it worse, and that it could have been much worse for me than it was…. It’s just, I can’t help how I feel and sermons on gratitude and perspective make me feel worse, not better. What you’re describing is actually common. Feeling cranky or impatient are often just distractions as we slowly try to make sense out of something that makes no sense. I remember marching around my apartment one day after my own heart attack and gathering up all the flowers and get-well cards and trashing the whole lot! I felt so annoyed that it looked like some kind of sick person lived here! Meanwhile, you are smart to refrain from complaining to friends/family about things like salt restrictions; instead, consider making an appointment to talk to a counsellor, pastor or therapist to help you get to that “what is, is” stage – much healthier for your heart than being upset at your Cheerios! The main eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) have different symptoms and diagnostic criteria. These questionnaires typically included questions about food and eating habits, relationship to food and behavioural patterns associated with eating disorders. People often remembered being weighed which could cause considerable distress. backwards so they don’t see the weight) and allow them to decide if they want to know the weight or not. Some people refused to be weighed or tried to produce a false weight. Sara describes going for the assessment with the psychiatrist. She works part time and is about to start University. She is in a relationship and lives in a shared house. White Scottish. And at that point I, I went with my Mum, no I didn't, I went with my CPN. Just on my own because it was probably for the best that she wasn't in the room at the same time and it was, it was with my CPN so when, when I was still at home and before I was hospitalised. And it went into normal assessment things and it was quite daunting but I already kind of knew what was going on. I needed to be taken out of my home environment to really reflect on things and to actually get better because, as much as my family helped, they can kind of hinder at the same time because they are so emotionally involved so it, it, it didn't really bother me at all. Maria thought the professionals avoided mentioning the diagnosis in order to “pacify” her. Katherine had felt labelled as “as an inconvenient person” when her behaviour was in fact caused by having anorexia nervosa. It was a relief to realise that a habit people had struggled to understand or had kept a secret was actually “a real thing” and there were other people experiencing the same. It proved that he wasn't 'intrinsically broken' but he had a serious illness. So I think that it was definitely a kind of mixed emotions really in that in that sense because it was it was actually positive for me to have something to be able to give a name because it was something that it meant that I wasn’t like intrinsically broken, you know, I wasn’t kind of wrong as a person. There were other people had been through similar experiences and that by extension there was something that somebody could do to help the situation. You know, I could work at it but at, you know, on the other hand, there was this this kind of illness that I didn’t know very much about and it’s very kind of was very serious diagnosis. But obviously, I knew that I had had a very difficult relationship with food at that point, and not just food but everything else by extension in in my life. So I knew that there was something although I wouldn’t have previously identified it as anorexia. Other people, at first, described feeling shock, upset and fear. For some, the diagnosis was completely unexpected and they were unprepared that they had “something so serious”. They often only had unhelpful ideas about what an eating disorder meant. Jamie broke down when he was told he had anorexia nervosa. But like I started, when they sort of explained to me I just started crying because I just, I just didn’t realise what I was doing to myself. And to that it makes you realise, I was like, “What? I’m doing that?” I just didn’t, it was just like the realisation of what I was actually doing cos to me it didn’t seem like anything. Oh I’m just selling my lunch. But to be put like in the context they put it, I was like, “Oh.” ‘Cos I just didn’t, ‘cos I was only like 14. And to find something like that is just like a shock. I was like, okay; I just didn’t really understand what was going on. And it’s like sort of a bit of a weird feeling to, thing to understand. It was just like “What?” I was just like, “Uh?” A realisation was just like you just didn’t, I didn’t quite know what to think. And did they mention eating disorders do you remember, or did they actually give you a diagnosis at that point? They said there was like, mentioned there was like something wrong like I was having trouble eating and they referred me to, like, not a, sort of like a clinic but not like an in-patient clinic to get like counselling and that, but they didn’t say, they didn’t like say, “Oh yeah, Anorexic.” Or something like that. It waited, I got in the car with my Mum and I turned around and said, “Does that mean I’m anorexic?” And she said, “Yeah.” And I just went and I just lost, I completely broke down ‘cos I just didn’t, putting that name to it sort of like shocked that, and I was like, I just didn’t, that’s just not what I thought I was doing. I just did not put that to what I was doing. It would have been nice to, not a leaflet, but just to be sat down and kind of explained what's going on and how we normally deal with this, just to make sure that you get better. Like just to kind of, not an example, but this is our plans because I really did feel like, I’m here now but where am I going and what does this mean for me now that I have this diagnosis? It, it was kind of explained in the sense of now we're going to try and get you into hospital but not explained in the sense that I didn't know I was gonna have to have a nasal-gastric tube put down. So I mean it would be really, it would have been really nice to get some more information on that in a more verbal sense rather than a leaflet kind of sense just to kind of get a grip on the situation that I was in because it's really hard to kind of centre yourself when you're in that situation. They said that they never thought they could have an eating disorder; it was something that other people had. They felt their behaviour wasn’t that bad and some who were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa thought that if they ate something (however little) they couldn’t have it. Laura said she preferred to think of having “eating problems” rather than a diagnosed illness and Nico, who had never been diagnosed, said he identified more with having “eating problems”. She had read about anorexic people in magazines and didn't feel as 'extreme'. Elene felt like 'a phoney' when she was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. She felt guilty for her parents taking time off work to attend appointments over something so 'stupid'. I’m fine”, like “Don’t be ridiculous.” So he said, “No she’s fine, she’s just, just a petite girl. There’s a difference between having an eating disorder and being petite, and naturally slim.” So I sort of went away, and would be like, “Told you so.” And this happened a couple more times, and my Mum just got so fed up because she could see clearly that something was wrong. Like definitely without a doubt you know your daughter is anorexic.” And I, at the time, just thought it was laughable. I thought that you know, I’ve read about anorexic people in magazines and like, “I’m not one of those. I’m not; it’s not that extreme you know.” It’s not like I ate nothing, I eat something and you know I, I just, I didn’t, I didn’t think it could happen to me. I felt kind of like a phoney that I was faking it or something and that like I felt like yeah, I felt like really guilty that like my parents were like having to, you know, like take time off work to like take me to these appointments when I was like actually, just faking it and nothing was wrong with me. And I was also really embarrassed like just because it seems such a stupid thing. Like I can remember like having, you know, like having to sit there and plan out a meal, like a day’s meals like it just seemed so stupid and embarrassing like. So I can remember feeling really embarrassed about it and but embarrassing that it was unnecessary even though like I was, obviously, like unable to like continue as I was. Some people were worried about being “labelled” with a mental health problem and that it would define them as a person, especially in other people’s eyes. Diagnosis could also cause embarrassment. Elena felt embarrassed that she was “stupid” about food and felt she ought to be able to just be normal and Andrew said anorexia nervosa diagnosis made him feel like “a weakling”. They, or sometimes their parents, had figured it out through doing research online. Suzanne said that getting a firm diagnosis of EDNOS was a relief as she had strongly suspected it herself. And I was thinking to myself, “Well I knew that,” because I’d taken all the online tests out of curiosity. I accidentally stumbled across one on the website that I’m a member of. And I’d taken quite a few different ones, ‘cos I got bored and I felt like doing it and I always scored at a very high risk of an eating disorder, or high risk. So it was kind of obvious but it was just nice to have the GP and a professional tell me, so it wasn’t in my imagination. Yeah because you said it was a relief? I was like “Yeah, I knew it.” I knew it, I just felt smug knowing that I was right and that I wasn’t crazy. When he referred me I was sort of like, “Oh my gosh like, it’s now all gonna stop.” And I kind of thought, like I kind of thought, part of my mind was, ‘I kind of want this help’ and the other half was just like, ‘No you have to kind of carry on, you can’t let them get involved in stuff like that.’ Yeah. So at some level, you were aware of that? Was there anywhere at that point that you did go for help or, you know, any sort of, I don’t know, peer support or anything like, was there anywhere at that point that you kind of found any? Mm, like you said you wanted it to be your own thing? But I think he kind of diagnosed me on the basis of my weight instead of like my mindset, kind of thing. So yeah and, so then he referred me on the basis of that and then it was an eating disorder obviously but yeah. Well, he gave me all them leaflets and he was like just, he was kind of like, “take it all in and everything,” and I was just like, “No,” I’m not gonna take it all in like you’re diagnosing me with like something so serious and I just thought, nah, it’s not, it’s not true at all. And like, I wanted, I kept on saying that and deep down I obviously knew that it probably was that but I just wanted to put up this kind of wall and just say no, it wasn’t that. The exact diagnosis could change over time, from one eating disorder to another, or from one subtype to another. Because on my forms they put Bulimia, I think that’s cos when I went, from the time to, from my assessment because it was then Christmas it was a while before I then started having treatment and in that time I gained weight so it kind of took me out of the Anorexia part so when they diagnosed me they put down Bulimia but when I, we had Family Therapy for a bit, I think my Mum and Dad asked about what I’d been diagnosed with and he said it was the purging type of Anorexia, which I hadn’t known, but so it was yeah it was the dietician that diagnosed me properly. Andrew's behaviour had traits of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. I suppose I went there for a while, didn’t really seem to be helping at all. It was easy for you to sit there and say that to me but quite a bit harder in practice. I was also bulimic because I was throwing up whatever I ate. sweaty but blood-soaked. I couldn't get the tent pegs to hold, so I sat on a folded shelter-half to keep my bottom dry and wrapped a blanket around my tired, aching body. I had to be ready the next day or be disgraced. At the \n\n Descendants of the common walking stick, trekking poles are usually used by hikers for the same reasons — to provide some rhythm to their walking pace and for added support. On flat, smooth terrain they really aren't necessary although using them can increase the exercise a hiker gets from the trip, as well as increase the speed. But on less certain terrain, or steep slopes, they provide useful lateral stability, and many turn to them for help with knee pain. They can also be used as aids when climbing rocks or boulders, to probe the depth of mud or water and facilitate a crossing. When traversing steep slopes for long distances, some hikers make one pole shorter than the other to make those trips feel more as if they were taking place on level ground. Some backpacking tents are designed to use trekking poles as tent poles. Along the same lines, trekking poles can be used to set up a Bivouac shelter. Hikers who take to snowshoes in winter find trekking poles especially useful. They can also be used in Nordic walking in a rural or urban environment. They aim to treat people in the least restricted way and as close to home as possible. (See ‘The Psychiatrist’ and ‘Treatment in hospital’). ‘I thought I was going to kill myself so I had emergency care and I was with the crisis team’. So what’s the difference then would you say between going to see a psychiatrist and seeing a psychologist? Or yes I think like he was expecting me to be on 150 I think and yes so at the end of that meeting he had to go and speak to his consultant about what would be the best thing to do next and, so I had to wait in the waiting room for a while and then he came back and said they wanted me to come into hospital which came as a real shock to me because even though they’d mentioned it previously they’d only really mentioned it and they hadn’t, specifically said they wanted me to go in....and I was really worried about going in and what that would involve and he told, because the Crisis member of staff was still with me at that time and he told the Crisis member, team member of staff to try and find a bed for me and it just, it all seemed to be happening so quickly. You felt it was being imposed on you? Yes and I felt a bit like the, because I knew as well that I was in quite a vulnerable place I felt that I would come to rely on that support and one of the things I really value is, is you know being independent and I think that ties in a lot with my self-esteem when I just, so I actually pushed a lot of people away like the Crisis Team I didn’t want to see anymore. No I’d see, well they wanted me to see a CPN, who I met with once but and he tried to arrange an appointment for me to see him but I didn’t want to see him. So he informed the consultant but. Why, what was the reason just because of that whole that you didn’t want so many people involved? Yes and it was just someone else new and it was, and it was almost ironic in that when I really needed the support which was when I was in hospital staring at those four walls and they weren’t coming to see me and, you know, that was when I really needed it. Dina not want to continue with the medicines she had been prescribed and felt she was being coerced by the CMHT ‘they said I had to take it physically in front of them because I mean I didn’t want to take my medication… basically the only thing that they were doing were to bring the drugs and insist that I take the drugs’. Several people were aware of a lack of continuity and ‘joined up thinking’ between the members of the mental health teams, the GP, and other therapists or counsellors they were seeing. Thomas felt frustrated that his GP, psychiatrist and psychologist seemed to have conflicting agendas ‘my psychologist... never focused on medication... He would see it as the psychiatrist job or the GP’s job. So it was a complete non communication between the people that I was seeing’. ‘They (CMHT) don’t like the fact that they have no awareness of what he’s [therapist] doing with me… equally he feels very frustrated because he feels that they’re stopping him from doing the work that he wants to do... he doesn’t agree with the medication I’m on… they want me to have therapy with them rather than him.’ But Sonia preferred to see the private therapist because she had built a relationship with the person, and it was easier to fit appointments around her job. but what happens is, certainly I found in my situation is that a lot of the time when things got extremely bad and extremely serious a lot of resources and costs had gone in to me which maybe could have been avoided, if I’d had access to their services earlier it costs a lot of money to be in there, you know, three months that are in a patient unit or, you know, to have regular CPN support and lots of meetings and lots of different health professionals, it’s very, very costly and I think the money isn't there for the real preventative work to kind of avoid people like myself actually.\n\nQuestion: What word can mean loose broken rocks or someone who is vulgarly self-assertive?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "It’s not that I felt sad (although I often did) but more that I just didn’t care. I slept in my clothes. I forgot about clean hair or basic hygiene. I just didn’t care how I looked or how I smelled. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was getting a firsthand remedial course in correcting those misconceptions about depression. It’s what mental health professionals call an adjustment disorder that can strike within weeks following a traumatic life event as we struggle to make sense of something that makes no sense. At the extreme, people with depression may harm themselves. Also, important brain chemicals called neurotransmitters appear to be out of balance. FACT: Depression is debilitating. Most people with the disorder will require treatment to get better. But it can also mean physical symptoms such as chest pain, queasiness or nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, sleep problems, exhaustion, and changes in weight or appetite. Dr. Khatri adds that many middle-aged women today are also often caring for both their own children and elderly parents, thus increasing stress levels which in turn can lead to depression. It has an end. – perhaps I wouldn’t have suffered needlessly for as long as I did before seeking professional help. I was getting used to using a walker because of balance problems, so I decided these were exceptionally severe muscle pains, moaned and whimpered as quietly as I could and kept popping Tylenol extra-strength for arthritis. Friday I went to a wedding, Sunday I went to church, and Monday morning I woke up with the same pain. Unpredictable bursting into tears–terribly embarrassing. I can relate (I too have popped out two children the old-fashioned way, and I once spent a month in hospital following a ruptured appendix and peritonitis!) Which is to say: you and I know our pain! Is that common, by any chance, or is it more likely that a myriad of personal factors specific to my life in particular triggered that instead? It’s impossible to tell if it’s the date circled on the calendar or, as you say, just personal factors going on in life that can impact these “rough patches”. Ah, that’s good to know. What’s that famous quotation about “life is what happens when we’re busy making other plans!”? I belong to a women’s group and one of our friends is severely depressed and pulled away from all of us. You are so right, you just don’t pull yourself up. Thank you for putting it in simpler terms what is happening to our friend. I plunged into such a depression. It was just as you describe… I had no motivation to do anything. What was the point? I was waiting for that proverbial other shoe to drop. The turning point seems to be when we are able to do something – ANYTHING! – even when we don’t want to, and when we can finally say, as you did: “I started to believe I just might survive!” Congratulations – You made it!! I thought I was coping and making rational decisions. Apparently, I was not. We are not always told what to expect and depression is one of the “biggies”. Life is good and I am one happy, contributing lady. Your own story is an excellent cautionary tale, i.e. Brava!! Instead, I’m ashamed to say, I took out all my frustrations on my nearest and dearest, who bore it all quietly for awhile – and then sat me down and read me the riot act, i.e. “you’re being very self-indulgent. Just wondering if anger was/is part of depression? Doesn’t sound like it, but who knows? My husband’s theory is that all that rage, directed at dietary changes, allowed me to vent about “the injustice” of what happened – and then get on with adjusting to it. I marched around the apartment one day gathering up all the bouquets of flowers and get-well cards that had been arriving – and trashed the lot of them. I was annoyed by the appearance that some kind of sick person lived here! Good luck with minimizing the histrionics! I was relatively fit, only about 10 lbs above my ideal weight, ate sensibly and didn’t smoke. I would look at obese people eating fast food and smoking and I’m ashamed to say that I thought, why me and not them!? I also have the attitude of “so what”. Hello Pam – you have touched on an under-appreciated element of this kind of depression: the disconcerting change in our very personality. I’ve quoted her writing often here because, although these are of course different diagnoses, the similarities with heart disease are striking. For example: Could ‘Goodism’ and Self-Sacrifice be Linked to Women’s Heart Disease Outcomes? Look, I KNOW that other people have it worse, and that it could have been much worse for me than it was…. It’s just, I can’t help how I feel and sermons on gratitude and perspective make me feel worse, not better. What you’re describing is actually common. Feeling cranky or impatient are often just distractions as we slowly try to make sense out of something that makes no sense. I remember marching around my apartment one day after my own heart attack and gathering up all the flowers and get-well cards and trashing the whole lot! I felt so annoyed that it looked like some kind of sick person lived here! Meanwhile, you are smart to refrain from complaining to friends/family about things like salt restrictions; instead, consider making an appointment to talk to a counsellor, pastor or therapist to help you get to that “what is, is” stage – much healthier for your heart than being upset at your Cheerios!

Some backpacking tents are designed to use trekking poles as tent poles. Along the same lines, trekking poles can be used to set up a Bivouac shelter. Hikers who take to snowshoes in winter find trekking poles especially useful. They can also be used in Nordic walking in a rural or urban environment. They aim to treat people in the least restricted way and as close to home as possible. (See ‘The Psychiatrist’ and ‘Treatment in hospital’). ‘I thought I was going to kill myself so I had emergency care and I was with the crisis team’. So what’s the difference then would you say between going to see a psychiatrist and seeing a psychologist? Or yes I think like he was expecting me to be on 150 I think and yes so at the end of that meeting he had to go and speak to his consultant about what would be the best thing to do next and, so I had to wait in the waiting room for a while and then he came back and said they wanted me to come into hospital which came as a real shock to me because even though they’d mentioned it previously they’d only really mentioned it and they hadn’t, specifically said they wanted me to go in....and I was really worried about going in and what that would involve and he told, because the Crisis member of staff was still with me at that time and he told the Crisis member, team member of staff to try and find a bed for me and it just, it all seemed to be happening so quickly. You felt it was being imposed on you? Yes and I felt a bit like the, because I knew as well that I was in quite a vulnerable place I felt that I would come to rely on that support and one of the things I really value is, is you know being independent and I think that ties in a lot with my self-esteem when I just, so I actually pushed a lot of people away like the Crisis Team I didn’t want to see anymore. No I’d see, well they wanted me to see a CPN, who I met with once but and he tried to arrange an appointment for me to see him but I didn’t want to see him. So he informed the consultant but. Why, what was the reason just because of that whole that you didn’t want so many people involved? Yes and it was just someone else new and it was, and it was almost ironic in that when I really needed the support which was when I was in hospital staring at those four walls and they weren’t coming to see me and, you know, that was when I really needed it. Dina not want to continue with the medicines she had been prescribed and felt she was being coerced by the CMHT ‘they said I had to take it physically in front of them because I mean I didn’t want to take my medication… basically the only thing that they were doing were to bring the drugs and insist that I take the drugs’. Several people were aware of a lack of continuity and ‘joined up thinking’ between the members of the mental health teams, the GP, and other therapists or counsellors they were seeing. Thomas felt frustrated that his GP, psychiatrist and psychologist seemed to have conflicting agendas ‘my psychologist... never focused on medication... He would see it as the psychiatrist job or the GP’s job. So it was a complete non communication between the people that I was seeing’. ‘They (CMHT) don’t like the fact that they have no awareness of what he’s [therapist] doing with me… equally he feels very frustrated because he feels that they’re stopping him from doing the work that he wants to do... he doesn’t agree with the medication I’m on… they want me to have therapy with them rather than him.’ But Sonia preferred to see the private therapist because she had built a relationship with the person, and it was easier to fit appointments around her job. but what happens is, certainly I found in my situation is that a lot of the time when things got extremely bad and extremely serious a lot of resources and costs had gone in to me which maybe could have been avoided, if I’d had access to their services earlier it costs a lot of money to be in there, you know, three months that are in a patient unit or, you know, to have regular CPN support and lots of meetings and lots of different health professionals, it’s very, very costly and I think the money isn't there for the real preventative work to kind of avoid people like myself actually.\n\n"

Pyridoxine is a B-complex water-soluble vitamin requiring regular daily intake. Niacin comes in two forms, an acid (nicotinic acid) and an amide (nicotinamide), neither of which has anything in common with nicotine. Niacin was also referred to as “PP” because it prevented pellagra, a niacin-deficiency disease whose symptoms include diarrhea, dermatitis and dementia. In common with other B vitamins, niacin is water-soluble. In addition to preformed niacin occurring in foods, niacin may also be made in the body from the amino acid tryptophan. Sixty molecules of tryptophan are required to make one molecule of niacin. The acid form, nicotinic acid, plays an important role in the nervous system and circulation. * The niacin equivalent is the niacin plus the tryptophan contribution in each food source. ** The niacin in whole-meal bread is unavailable to the body; the niacin equivalent figure comes from the tryptophan contribution. The Health Food Manufacturers’ Association therefore recommends the maximum dosage should be 100 mg in an immediate release form and that timed-release nicotinic acid should not be available. Niacin works with the other B-complex vitamins, but may be taken separately as part of a nutritional therapeutic program. People suffering from diabetes, gout, stomach ulcers and liver problems should not take nicotinic acid. Thiamin is known as “the morale vitamin” because of the beneficial effects it has on the nervous system and morale. After vitamin C, it is the least stable of all vitamins. Probably, the earliest symptom of deficiency is continuous nausea. Thiamin is a very safe vitamin. Thiamin is one of the B-complex vitamins and so ideally should be taken as part of the complex, although single supplementation may be acceptable as part of a nutritional therapeutic program. Vitamin A occurs in two forms: preformed vitamin A, known as retinol, and provitamin A, also known as beta carotene. Because it is fat-soluble and stored in the liver, it need not be replenished every day. Vitamin A helps maintain healthy skin, teeth and bones, as well as mucous membranes, such as those in the nose, throat and lungs. Vitamin A is needed for proper development of the fetus in the womb. Marginal deficiency will lead to increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and skin problems. those with malabsorption syndromes, e.g. Taken in excess, vitamin A can lead to toxicity because it is stored in the liver. Vitamin A toxicity is usually fully reversible. Vitamins A and D (both fat-soluble vitamins) are found together in many food sources, although they are not actually dependent upon one another for their absorption or utilization. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in a variety of bodily functions. It is true that niacin has several important functions within the body. Firstly, niacin is involved in energy production as it is a necessary component of the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are responsible for carrying out reactions that produce ATP, the body's primary source of energy. Furthermore, niacin is also involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. In addition to its roles in energy production and metabolism, niacin is known for its positive effects on the cardiovascular system. Niacin can be obtained from dietary sources such as meat, fish, nuts, and whole grains. In some cases, dietary intake may be insufficient, and niacin supplements may be recommended to ensure an adequate intake. However, it is important to note that excessive intake of niacin can lead to side effects, such as flushing, itching, and liver problems. Therefore, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any niacin supplementation. In summary, niacin is an essential nutrient that plays a significant role in energy production, metabolism, and cardiovascular health. It is important to maintain a balanced intake of niacin through a healthy diet or under the guidance of a healthcare professional to avoid deficiencies or excessive intake. Sardines are rich in vitamins and minerals. A small serving of sardines once a day can provide 13% of vitamin B2; roughly one-quarter of niacin; and about 150% of the recommended daily value of vitamin B12. All B vitamins help to support proper nervous system function and are used for energy metabolism, or converting food into energy. These fatty acids can also lower blood sugar levels. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. The B vitamin complex consists of several vitamins, including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12).

Under the plan, Jews and other \"lesser races\" along with political opponents from Germany as well as occupied countries were systematically murdered at murder sites, and starting in 1942, at extermination camps. Between 1941 and 1945 Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically disabled and members of other groups were targeted and methodically murdered – the origin of the word \"genocide\". The story takes place during World War II in 1940 in Berlin. The book conveys the omnipresent fear and suspicion engulfing Germany at the time caused by the constant threat of arrest, imprisonment, torture and death. Escherich, a Gestapo inspector, must find the source of hundreds of postcards encouraging Germans to resist Adolf Hitler and the Nazis with personal messages such as “Mother! The Führer has murdered my son. In her novel Briar Rose a child finds out that her grandmother was a survivor of the Holocaust and then tries to find the identity and the life of her grandmother. ; Markus Zusak's The Book Thief (2005) is a Holocaust story narrated by Death himself. ; Australian Morris Gleitzman's novels for children Once (2005), Then (2009), Now (2010), and After (2011) deal with Jewish children on the run from the Nazis during World War II.

Under the plan, Jews and other \"lesser races\" along with political opponents from Germany as well as occupied countries were systematically murdered at murder sites, and starting in 1942, at extermination camps. Between 1941 and 1945 Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically disabled and members of other groups were targeted and methodically murdered – the origin of the word \"genocide\".

The book conveys the omnipresent fear and suspicion engulfing Germany at the time caused by the constant threat of arrest, imprisonment, torture and death.

She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Personal life\nBorn Suzanne Marie Mahoney in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California, Somers is the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Her mother, Marion Elizabeth (née Turner), was a medical secretary, and her father, Francis Mahoney, was a laborer and gardener. When Suzanne was six years old her father became an alcoholic. Somers's father would call her names and embarrass her. Somers attended Capuchino High School She also said she was a cheerleader at Mercy High School in Burlingame, California, and was accepted at San Francisco College for Women, a college run by the Catholic Society of the Sacred Heart order. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. They married in 1977. Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa. Career\n\nEarly acting roles\nSomers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the \"Blonde in the white Thunderbird\" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck (as the femme fatale) in the early 1970s. She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless \"pool girl\" in Magnum Force in 1973. She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde \"Chrissy Snow\" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary. After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth episodes of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., \"TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as \"...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment\") and told the New York Post: \"These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. \"Breaking Through\nIn 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter died. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. ... Somers, whose hormone regimen involves creams, injections and some 60 supplements daily, got a huge boost earlier this year from Oprah Winfrey. 'Many people write Suzanne off as a quackadoo' Winfrey said when Somers appeared on her show. Yet Winfrey's tacit support of Somers gave her some of the worst press of her career. Another headline, on Salon.com: 'Oprah's Bad Medicine'.\" Television workAnniversary Game (1969–70)Mantrap (1971–73)Lotsa Luck (1974)The Rockford Files – The Big Ripoff (aired October 25, 1974)Sky Heist (1975)Starsky & Hutch (1975–79, 3 appearances)Match Game (1977/PM) (1977)Tattletales (1977)Three's Company (1977–81)Happily Ever After (1978)Zuma Beach (1978)Hollywood Wives (1985) (miniseries)Goodbye Charlie (1985)She's the Sheriff (1987–89)Rich Men, Single Women (1990)Step by Step (1991–98)Keeping Secrets (1991)Exclusive (1992) (also co-executive producer)The Suzanne Somers Show (1994–95)Full House (1994)Seduced by Evil (1994)8-Track Flashback (1995–98)Devil's Food (1996)Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade (1996) (Host)Love-Struck (1997)Candid Camera (co-host from 1997–2000)No Laughing Matter (1998)The Darklings (1999)Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List (2009) (guest appearance)ShopNBCThe Suzanne Show (2012) (Host)The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (2013) (guest appearance)Dancing with the Stars (2015) (contestant)Home & Family (2017)\n\nFilmographyBullitt (1968) (uncredited)Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (1969) (uncredited)Fools (1970) (uncredited)American Graffiti (1973)Magnum Force (1973) (uncredited)It Happened at Lakewood Manor (1977)Billy Jack Goes to Washington (1977)Zuma Beach (1978)Yesterday's Hero (1979)Nothing Personal (1980)Totally Minnie (1987)Serial Mom (1994) (herself)Rusty: A Dog's Tale (1998) (voice)Say It Isn't So'' (2001) (cameo)\n\nPublished works\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1946 births\n20th-century American actresses\n20th-century American women writers\n20th-century American non-fiction writers\n21st-century American actresses\n21st-century American women writers\n21st-century American non-fiction writers\nAlternative cancer treatment advocates\nAlternative medicine activists\nAmerican autobiographers\nAmerican female models\nAmerican film actresses\nAmerican health and wellness writers\nAmerican women non-fiction writers\nAmerican self-help writers\nAmerican people of Irish descent\nAmerican television actresses\nAmerican women comedians\nComedians from California\nGame show models\nLiving people\nPeople from the San Francisco Bay Area\nPeople from San Bruno, California\nPseudoscientific diet advocates\nUniversity of San Francisco alumni\nWomen autobiographers\nWriters from California\n20th-century American comedians\n21st-century American comedians\n\nSuzanne Marie Somers (née Mahoney; October 16, 1946) is an American actress, author, singer, businesswoman, and health spokesperson.

Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial.

She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Personal life\nBorn Suzanne Marie Mahoney in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California, Somers is the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Her mother, Marion Elizabeth (née Turner), was a medical secretary, and her father, Francis Mahoney, was a laborer and gardener. When Suzanne was six years old her father became an alcoholic. Somers's father would call her names and embarrass her. Somers attended Capuchino High School She also said she was a cheerleader at Mercy High School in Burlingame, California, and was accepted at San Francisco College for Women, a college run by the Catholic Society of the Sacred Heart order. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. They married in 1977. Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa. Career\n\nEarly acting roles\nSomers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the \"Blonde in the white Thunderbird\" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck (as the femme fatale) in the early 1970s. She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless \"pool girl\" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode \"Cheshire Project,” she played a passenger on the first episode of The Love Boat as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time. She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde \"Chrissy Snow\" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary. After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth episodes of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., \"TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as \"...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment\") and told the New York Post: \"These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. \"Breaking Through\nIn 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter died. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. ...

History\n\nOld City (c. 1826-1947)\nBikur Cholim opened in a rented building in the Old City around 1826. It was run by the Bikur Cholim society. After the Mission established a medical facility in the Old City, hoping to attract Jews, the society intensified its activity. In 1864, another complex of buildings was acquired incorporating treatment rooms, a pharmacy, a hospice for the terminally ill and administrative offices. The Ashkenazi Perushim Hospital, as it was known, became the favorite charity of the British Jewish philanthropist Moses Montefiore, who described the facility in his diary in 1875. One room was reserved for men, and the other for women. New building (1925)\nIn 1898, during his visit to Jerusalem, German emperor Wilhelm II donated a large amount of money used for purchasing the plot of land on which the new hospital was built, on what is now Nathan Straus Street. A decision was reached to build a new hospital outside the walls of the Old City. The cornerstone of the new building was laid in 1912, but construction work was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. The building on Chancellor Avenue (now Straus Street), just off Jaffa Road, was completed in 1925 and opened its doors to all residents of Jerusalem, Jews and non-Jews. The hospital in the Old City continued to treat the chronically ill until 1947. Many of the wounded from the 1929 Palestine riots and 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine were brought to Bikur Holim.

Following the set-up of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 21April 1948. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of people of J&K must be ascertained.

There are three types of ceramic objects. They are earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Each of these types of ceramic objects are fired at different degrees and come in different colors. The materials used in their construction are often a clay body, and some times mixed with sand, shell, chalk, mica, and ground-up fired ceramics. The surface of these ceramic objects are finished with glaze and fired in a number of ways. Decorations with gold, paint or enamel are applied over the glaze. A ceramic object is also vulnerable to weeping and crizzling from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.

One method creates a smooth surface covered with clay slip, terra sigillata, which responds particularly well to the saggar technique. Porcelain and stoneware are ideal for displaying the surface patterns obtained through saggar firing. Examples have been dated as early as 29,000&ndash;25,000 BCE, while the earliest known kiln dates to around 6000 BCE, and was found at the Yarim Tepe site in modern Iraq.

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career.

Additional episodes currently being produced include an interview with the author of a new biography about Gordon Lightfoot and an in-depth interview with Merilee Rush (“Angel of the Morning”). During that time, the band saturated the music charts and radio stations with songs such as “I’m a Believer,” “Daydream Believer,” “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Valleri,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone” and many others. Insight into their careers is provided by Monkees expert Fred Velez, who writes a blog for the website Monkees.net, and he authored the book A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You: The Monkees From A Fan’s Perspective. Velez, who has a wealth of knowledge about the group, also offers some behind the scenes history, including how the Monkees and the Beatles hung out together, and how Dolenz ended up using a Beatles song in an episode of the Monkees TV show. This episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at the tribute album and artist such as Garth Brooks, who performs “Phoenix” with Trisha Yearwood providing background vocals; the late Donna Sumer, who sings an inspiring version of “Nether Lands” using the same backing track that Fogelberg used for the 1977 classic; Amy Grant and Vince Gill, who provide a duet on “Longer” that gives new life to Fogelberg’s biggest hit; Randy Owen, the legendary voice of the group Alabama – the best-selling country group of all time – sings “Sutter’s Mill,” originally from Fogelberg’s progressive bluegrass album ‘High Country Snows;’ Zac Brown and his band deliver a live version of “Leader of the Band;” and Fogelberg’s good friend Joe Walsh of the Eagles sings “Part of the Plan,” a song he originally produced for Fogelberg for the 1974 album Souvenirs. Included in this presentation is inside, background information from Fogelberg’s former record producer, Norbert Putnam, one of the tribute album’s co-producers. You can hear more from Putnam about his relationship with Dan Fogelberg in the Documenting Popular Music episode ‘Leader of the Band — Remembering Dan Fogelberg with Stories and Insights from His Record Producer’ released earlier this year. Coming soon from Documenting Popular Music, a look at Gordon Lightfoot’s career with author Nicholas Jennings; a conversation with Merrilee Rush (“Angle of the Morning”), a look at TV theme songs from the 1970s that became Top 40 hits; and a biographical sketch of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Class of 2018. I’m happy I could use Norbert’s recollections about Brooks and Summer for this review of the tribute album. The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. \"Blank Page\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera, taken from her seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). It was written by Aguilera, Chris Braide and Sia Furler, with production done by Braide. It garnered strong critical acclaim from music critics, who praised its simplistic arrangement as well as Aguilera's raw and strong vocal performance on the song. Aguilera performed the song live for the first time at the 39th People's Choice Awards, where she was awarded with the People's Voice Award. Marie Möör is known on the French music scene for her distinctive style, expressed in songs such as Pretty Day, La Man and J'aime l'ennui. Having collaborated with renowned artists like jazz saxophonist and composer Barney Wilen, singer-songwriter Jean-Louis Murat, electro-crooner Bertrand Burgalat and pop star Christophe, she has been working with composer and musician Laurent Chambert since 2001. Experimenting with new song forms, she writes and performs his lyrics. Winner of the 2008 Qwartz Electronic Music Awards : Laurent Chambert - Suspense, he has written, performed, and produced numerous recordings, including Eurêka, in the INA-GRM studios, in 2008. Annie Clark has said that the song \"encapsulates this idea where we've become very dependent on other people [...] a million digital eyes, validating our experience\". The lyrics are a clear commentary on social media, including Clark's own experience on websites such as Twitter, which self-deprecatingly she describes as \"pathetic\". Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph compared \"Digital Witness\" to \"I Should Watch TV\", a track from Love This Giant, Clark's 2013 collaboration with David Byrne; she concluded that Clark likely took a cue from Byrne in composing \"Digital Witness\". St. Asaph noted similarities between the funky rhythms and brass instruments in both tracks, as well as their shared lyrical themes. She calls \"Digital Witness\" \"celebratory as it's cautionary\", like \"I Should Watch TV\", which she describes as \"half-embracing\" and \"half-disdaining\" popular television culture. Reviewer Heather Phares expressed a similar sentiment, calling \"Digital Witness\" a song with \"close kinship\" to Love This Giant.\n\nQuestion: Which country the performer of song 98.6 (Song) is from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at the tribute album and artist such as Garth Brooks, who performs “Phoenix” with Trisha Yearwood providing background vocals; the late Donna Sumer, who sings an inspiring version of “Nether Lands” using the same backing track that Fogelberg used for the 1977 classic; Amy Grant and Vince Gill, who provide a duet on “Longer” that gives new life to Fogelberg’s biggest hit; Randy Owen, the legendary voice of the group Alabama – the best-selling country group of all time – sings “Sutter’s Mill,” originally from Fogelberg’s progressive bluegrass album ‘High Country Snows;’ Zac Brown and his band deliver a live version of “Leader of the Band;” and Fogelberg’s good friend Joe Walsh of the Eagles sings “Part of the Plan,” a song he originally produced for Fogelberg for the 1974 album Souvenirs. Included in this presentation is inside, background information from Fogelberg’s former record producer, Norbert Putnam, one of the tribute album’s co-producers. You can hear more from Putnam about his relationship with Dan Fogelberg in the Documenting Popular Music episode ‘Leader of the Band — Remembering Dan Fogelberg with Stories and Insights from His Record Producer’ released earlier this year. Coming soon from Documenting Popular Music, a look at Gordon Lightfoot’s career with author Nicholas Jennings; a conversation with Merrilee Rush (“Angle of the Morning”), a look at TV theme songs from the 1970s that became Top 40 hits; and a biographical sketch of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Class of 2018. I’m happy I could use Norbert’s recollections about Brooks and Summer for this review of the tribute album. The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. \"Blank Page\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera, taken from her seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). It was written by Aguilera, Chris Braide and Sia Furler, with production done by Braide. It garnered strong critical acclaim from music critics, who praised its simplistic arrangement as well as Aguilera's raw and strong vocal performance on the song. Aguilera performed the song live for the first time at the 39th People's Choice Awards, where she was awarded with the People's Voice Award. Marie Möör is known on the French music scene for her distinctive style, expressed in songs such as Pretty Day, La Man and J'aime l'ennui. Having collaborated with renowned artists like jazz saxophonist and composer Barney Wilen, singer-songwriter Jean-Louis Murat, electro-crooner Bertrand Burgalat and pop star Christophe, she has been working with composer and musician Laurent Chambert since 2001. Experimenting with new song forms, she writes and performs his lyrics. Winner of the 2008 Qwartz Electronic Music Awards : Laurent Chambert - Suspense, he has written, performed, and produced numerous recordings, including Eurêka, in the INA-GRM studios, in 2008. Annie Clark has said that the song \"encapsulates this idea where we've become very dependent on other people [...] a million digital eyes, validating our experience\". The lyrics are a clear commentary on social media, including Clark's own experience on websites such as Twitter, which self-deprecatingly she describes as \"pathetic\". Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph compared \"Digital Witness\" to \"I Should Watch TV\", a track from Love This Giant, Clark's 2013 collaboration with David Byrne; she concluded that Clark likely took a cue from Byrne in composing \"Digital Witness\". St. Asaph noted similarities between the funky rhythms and brass instruments in both tracks, as well as their shared lyrical themes. She calls \"Digital Witness\" \"celebratory as it's cautionary\", like \"I Should Watch TV\", which she describes as \"half-embracing\" and \"half-disdaining\" popular television culture. Reviewer Heather Phares expressed a similar sentiment, calling \"Digital Witness\" a song with \"close kinship\" to Love This Giant.\n\n"

The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\". On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO). As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\". Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\". On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

On August 15, 2008, at 4:30 in the afternoon, 27 members of the so-called Kingdom of Hawaii Nation, a national-independence fringe faction, entered the grounds of Iolani Palace. The group was led by James Akahi, who claims descent from Kamehameha I and called himself \"Majesty Akahi Nui, King of Hawaii\". The purported mission of the group was to establish the palace as a new seat of government, undermine the State government, and declare the independence of Hawaii from the United States. The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\". On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO). As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\". Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.

In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\".

On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).

Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

        "context": "The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS.

All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\". On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO). As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\". Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers.

On August 15, 2008, at 4:30 in the afternoon, 27 members of the so-called Kingdom of Hawaii Nation, a national-independence fringe faction, entered the grounds of Iolani Palace. The group was led by James Akahi, who claims descent from Kamehameha I and called himself \"Majesty Akahi Nui, King of Hawaii\". The purported mission of the group was to establish the palace as a new seat of government, undermine the State government, and declare the independence of Hawaii from the United States.

Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Activities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) 1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. 1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. 2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. In 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\". On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\". On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\" The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO). As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\". Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia.

On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO). As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\". Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. Membership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. Pressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. Taiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.

It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016. Plot \nEarly one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. Révol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. Révol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Characters \n Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. He also blames himself for introducing his son to surfing, which is what led to the fatal car accident that took his life. She is selected to received Simon's heart after being placed on the Biomedical Agency's priority list of recipients due to her state of acute deterioration. He oversees Simon's case and declares him officially brain-dead. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. Meanwhile, Marianne blames herself for not doing enough to protect Simon from his reckless lifestyle, but she eventually realizes that allowing him to lead his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean could've done for him. In essence, Simon's body serves as a memorial in dedication to his life, and ruining it would diminish his memory and legacy. Background and development \n\nIn 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher Éditions Verticales. Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased. She then met with an emergency physician at the agency who introduced her to Cristal, a software that stores medical records, serves as a database of patients awaiting organ donations, matches donors with suitable recipients, and protects their identities. Critical reception \nUpon its initial release in France in 2014, The Heart was widely lauded. In his review, French journalist and television personality Bernard Pivot described The Heart as a \"story driven with [the] surgical precision of a heart transplant\" and called it \"an extraordinary novel that now classifies Maylis de Kerangal among the major writers of the early twenty-first century.\" French cultural and television magazine Télérama gave The Heart a five-star rating and commended the continuous flow and musicality of de Kerangal's prose. In her review for The New York Times, Priya Parmar recounted the novel as a \"...story [that] unfolds in an intricate lacework of precise detail\" and described the characters as \"less like fictional creations and more like ordinary people, briefly illuminated in rich language, beautifully translated by Sam Taylor, that veers from the medical to the philosophical.\" In her critique for the American edition of The Guardian, Lydia Kiesling emphasized on how The Heart embodied the importance of narratives to medicine and vice versa, and also commended de Kerangal as a \"master of momentum\" who \"liberates medicine from the language that, by necessity, has constrained its practice.\" In an entry titled \"A Poetic Novel About Grief\" for his blog Gates Notes, Bill Gates described The Heart  as \"poetry disguised as a novel\" that deftly formed a strong connection between readers and characters who appear only briefly in the novel, and that compelled him to \"feel the depth of grief,\" which he identified as a fulfilling and insightful personal experience. In a mixed review, Kirkus Reviews criticized The Heart for becoming \"anticlimactic\" in its second half after its crucial turning point and described it as \"a sophisticated medical drama whose pulse-pounding strength diminishes a touch too quickly.\" Awards \nSince its first publication in 2014, The Heart has received several accolades, including:\n\nFrench \n\n 2014 Grand Prix RTL-Lire\n 2014 Prix Pierre-Espil\n 2014 Orange Book Award\n 2014 Charles Brisset Literary Award\n 2014 Lire Magazine Best French Novel Prize\n 2014 L'Express - BFMTV Reader's Prize\n 2014 Prix France Culture-Télérama - Student Choice Novel\n 2015 Relay Prize for Travelers\n\nEnglish \n\n 2017 Wellcome Book Prize\n\nAdaptations \n\nIn France, The Heart has been adapted by French actor Emmanuel Noblet into a one-man stage play named after the original French title of the novel, Réparer les vivants.

        "context": "The Heart  is a 2014 realistic and medical fiction novel by the French author Maylis de Kerangal. It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016. Plot \nEarly one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. Révol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. Révol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Characters \n Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. He also blames himself for introducing his son to surfing, which is what led to the fatal car accident that took his life. She is selected to received Simon's heart after being placed on the Biomedical Agency's priority list of recipients due to her state of acute deterioration. He oversees Simon's case and declares him officially brain-dead. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. Meanwhile, Marianne blames herself for not doing enough to protect Simon from his reckless lifestyle, but she eventually realizes that allowing him to lead his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean could've done for him. In essence, Simon's body serves as a memorial in dedication to his life, and ruining it would diminish his memory and legacy. Background and development \n\nIn 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher Éditions Verticales. Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased. She then met with an emergency physician at the agency who introduced her to Cristal, a software that stores medical records, serves as a database of patients awaiting organ donations, matches donors with suitable recipients, and protects their identities.

The reform, nicknamed “Romneycare,” was signed into law by then-Gov. Mitt Romney. The Affordable Care Act, nicknamed “Obamacare,” was modeled on the Massachusetts law. “In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority acted as an exchange where regulated private insurance plans were offered to mostly previously uninsured residents.” Van der Wees was at Harvard during the study. The study, “Improvements in Health Status after Massachusetts Health Care Reform,” lasted from 2001 to 2011. After broader insurance coverage became available, residents of Massachusetts reported significant improvements in general, physical, and mental health, especially among those whose income was within 300 percent of the federal poverty level. “Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform in Massachusetts that may also be achieved through the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act,” stated study co-author John Z. Ayanian, M.D., MPP, director of the University of Michigan’s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, in a press release. “However, our results at state level in Massachusetts demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform at national level,” he added. The editor of the Milbank Quarterly, University of Massachusetts Medical School professor Howard Markel, M.D., Ph.D., called the study an important contribution to the understanding of the potential implications of the federal Affordable Care Act, in a statement from the University of Michigan Health System. “In an era of demagoguery and exaggeration posing as ‘facts’ it is essential to collect and analyze solid evidence on our nation’s health care policies,” said Markel. There were a number of different health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration. Key reforms address cost and coverage and include obesity, prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, defensive medicine or tort reform, incentives that reward more care instead of better care, redundant payment systems, tax policy, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology, among others. The first of these reform proposals to be passed by the United States Congress is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which originated in the Senate and was later passed by the House of Representatives in amended form on March 21, 2010 (with a vote of 219–212). President Obama signed the reforms into law on March 23, 2010. Reuters and CNN summarized the reforms and the year in which they take effect. Overview\n\nA variety of specific types of reform have been suggested to improve the United States health care system. These range from increased use of health care technology through changing the anti-trust rules governing health insurance companies and tort-reform to rationing of care. During a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. He also argued for bundling payments and accountable care organizations, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes. Mayo Clinic President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four \"pillars\" of such a strategy:\nFocus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;\nPay for and align incentives with value;\nCover everyone;\nEstablish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" A report published by the Commonwealth Fund in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices. During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time. Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011. Reasons include, among others: \nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\nRising out-of-pocket payments;\nDeductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and\nThe proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher.\" Best practices\n\nIndependent advisory panels\nPresident Obama has proposed an \"Independent Medicare Advisory Panel\" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Former OMB Director Peter Orszag stated: \"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\" Pilot programs\nGawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates.

This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill. Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program.

[w]ithout appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities\"\n\nPremium tax subsidies to help individuals purchase their own health insurance have also been suggested as a way to increase coverage rates. However, research also suggests that subsidies alone are unlikely to solve the uninsured problem in the U.S.\n\nGovernment action\n\nAddress Medicare fraud\nThe Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a \"high-risk\" government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. Estimates of Medicare fraud or \"improper payments\" vary. The Office of Management and Budget reported that $54 billion in \"improper payments\" were made to Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. CBO reported in October 2014 that it is difficult to quantify healthcare fraud related to government programs. CBO reported that: \"According to HHS, since 2009 the HEAT Medicare task\nforce has filed criminal and civil charges against more than 1,700 defendants who falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $5.5 billion.\" According to CBS News, Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and \"has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America.\" Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. Its enforcement budget is \"extremely limited\" according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\" The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims. During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types, including Medicare and Medicaid. President Obama has directed his administration to reduce these payments by $50 million annually by 2012, less than 1%. However, research suggests that current pay or play proposals are limited in their ability to increase coverage among the working poor. Proposed reforms would prohibit health insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. Arguing against requiring individuals to buy coverage, the Cato Institute has asserted that the Massachusetts law forcing everyone to buy insurance has increased costs: \"Premiums are growing 21 to 46 percent faster than the national average, in part because Massachusetts' individual mandate has effectively outlawed affordable health plans.\" They also say that by prohibiting the use of health status in pricing, the Massachusetts law \"further increase[s] premiums for the young and healthy\" and, as the result of adverse selection, drives more comprehensive health plans out of the market. Massachusetts shows that such a mandate would oust millions from their low-cost health plans and force them to pay higher premiums.\" Writing in the New York Times opinion blog \"Room for Debate\" the single-payer health care advocate Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said that a coverage mandate would not be necessary within a single-payer system and that even within the context of current system she was \"troubled by the notion of an individual mandate.\" She described the Massachusetts mandates as \"a windfall for the insurance industry\" and wrote, \"Premiums are rising much faster than income, benefit packages are getting skimpier, and deductibles and co-payments are going up.\" In April 2009 the Boston Globe reported that the number of people seeking emergency room care and the cost of emergency room visits increased after the 2006 mandates went into effect (comparing 2005 to 2007). In August 2009 the Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts had \"the most expensive family health insurance premiums in the country.\" Premiums in Massachusetts increased by 40 percent from 2003 to 2008, compared to a national average increase of 33%. The report did not break out the amount of the increase since 2006, but as the Massachusetts reforms are often taken as a model for national reform, \"advocates on various sides of the issue said the report underscores the urgency of including cost controls in any large-scale federal or state overhaul.\" Addressing the issue when it was proposed in 1994, CBO wrote: \"A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate provision as Constitutional. He argues that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of pre-existing medical conditions. Former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Some places, like Oregon for example, do explicitly ration Medicaid resources using medical priorities. Politicians on the right tend to be fearful of democratically elected governments becoming involved in rationing decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) makes similar arguments claiming for example that people like the late Senator Edward Kennedy received health care in the U.S. that would have been denied in countries which have government controlled health care, a claim that The Economist magazine said was \"dangerous\" and went on to say that \"The reality is that America, like Britain, already makes extensive use of rationing. Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would enable $200 billion per year in cost savings, primarily via insurance company overhead. Among the organizations in support of single-payer health care in the U.S. is Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), an organization of some 17,000 American physicians, medical students, and health professionals. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals. In March 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor). Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this. A study of the effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20–64 years old - 1 death per 830 people with insurance. Other studies, just as those examining the randomized distribution of Medicaid insurance to low-income people in Oregon in 2008, found no change in death rate. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year. Waste and fraud\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and Senior Medicare Patrols—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.

Key reforms address cost and coverage and include obesity, prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, defensive medicine or tort reform, incentives that reward more care instead of better care, redundant payment systems, tax policy, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology, among others. The first of these reform proposals to be passed by the United States Congress is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which originated in the Senate and was later passed by the House of Representatives in amended form on March 21, 2010 (with a vote of 219–212). President Obama signed the reforms into law on March 23, 2010. Reuters and CNN summarized the reforms and the year in which they take effect. Overview\n\nA variety of specific types of reform have been suggested to improve the United States health care system. These range from increased use of health care technology through changing the anti-trust rules governing health insurance companies and tort-reform to rationing of care. During a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. He also argued for bundling payments and accountable care organizations, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes. Mayo Clinic President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four \"pillars\" of such a strategy:\nFocus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;\nPay for and align incentives with value;\nCover everyone;\nEstablish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" A report published by the Commonwealth Fund in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices. During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time. Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011. Reasons include, among others: \nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\nRising out-of-pocket payments;\nDeductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and\nThe proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher.\" Best practices\n\nIndependent advisory panels\nPresident Obama has proposed an \"Independent Medicare Advisory Panel\" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Former OMB Director Peter Orszag stated: \"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\" Pilot programs\nGawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. Official budget scores of universal health care proposals state that most of its savings would be from providing preventative care to the uninsured. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid. State obesity rates ranged from 18.7% to 30%. One July 2012 proposal advocated that consumers of healthcare always have \"skin in the game\" such that their costs rise as more services are provided. Address expensive chronic cases\nThe CBO reported in May 2005: \"Medicare spending is highly concentrated, with a small number of beneficiaries accounting for a large proportion of the Medicare program's annual expenditures.

This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill. Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program.

Peterson has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Some places, like Oregon for example, do explicitly ration Medicaid resources using medical priorities. Politicians on the right tend to be fearful of democratically elected governments becoming involved in rationing decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) makes similar arguments claiming for example that people like the late Senator Edward Kennedy received health care in the U.S. that would have been denied in countries which have government controlled health care, a claim that The Economist magazine said was \"dangerous\" and went on to say that \"The reality is that America, like Britain, already makes extensive use of rationing. Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would enable $200 billion per year in cost savings, primarily via insurance company overhead. Among the organizations in support of single-payer health care in the U.S. is Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), an organization of some 17,000 American physicians, medical students, and health professionals. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals. In March 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor). Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this. A study of the effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20–64 years old - 1 death per 830 people with insurance. Other studies, just as those examining the randomized distribution of Medicaid insurance to low-income people in Oregon in 2008, found no change in death rate. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year. Waste and fraud\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and Senior Medicare Patrols—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.

        "context": "A recent 10-year study found Massachusetts residents had better health and better health care since the state’s health care reform in 2006, which expanded insurance coverage for the low-income population. The reform, nicknamed “Romneycare,” was signed into law by then-Gov. Mitt Romney. The Affordable Care Act, nicknamed “Obamacare,” was modeled on the Massachusetts law. “In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority acted as an exchange where regulated private insurance plans were offered to mostly previously uninsured residents.” Van der Wees was at Harvard during the study. The study, “Improvements in Health Status after Massachusetts Health Care Reform,” lasted from 2001 to 2011. After broader insurance coverage became available, residents of Massachusetts reported significant improvements in general, physical, and mental health, especially among those whose income was within 300 percent of the federal poverty level. “Our results demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform in Massachusetts that may also be achieved through the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act,” stated study co-author John Z. Ayanian, M.D., MPP, director of the University of Michigan’s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, in a press release. “However, our results at state level in Massachusetts demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform at national level,” he added. The editor of the Milbank Quarterly, University of Massachusetts Medical School professor Howard Markel, M.D., Ph.D., called the study an important contribution to the understanding of the potential implications of the federal Affordable Care Act, in a statement from the University of Michigan Health System. “In an era of demagoguery and exaggeration posing as ‘facts’ it is essential to collect and analyze solid evidence on our nation’s health care policies,” said Markel. There were a number of different health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration. Key reforms address cost and coverage and include obesity, prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, defensive medicine or tort reform, incentives that reward more care instead of better care, redundant payment systems, tax policy, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology, among others. The first of these reform proposals to be passed by the United States Congress is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which originated in the Senate and was later passed by the House of Representatives in amended form on March 21, 2010 (with a vote of 219–212). President Obama signed the reforms into law on March 23, 2010. Reuters and CNN summarized the reforms and the year in which they take effect. Overview\n\nA variety of specific types of reform have been suggested to improve the United States health care system. These range from increased use of health care technology through changing the anti-trust rules governing health insurance companies and tort-reform to rationing of care. During a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. He also argued for bundling payments and accountable care organizations, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes. Mayo Clinic President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four \"pillars\" of such a strategy:\nFocus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;\nPay for and align incentives with value;\nCover everyone;\nEstablish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" A report published by the Commonwealth Fund in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices. During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time. Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011. Reasons include, among others: \nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\nRising out-of-pocket payments;\nDeductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and\nThe proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher.\" Best practices\n\nIndependent advisory panels\nPresident Obama has proposed an \"Independent Medicare Advisory Panel\" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Former OMB Director Peter Orszag stated: \"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\" Pilot programs\nGawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. Official budget scores of universal health care proposals state that most of its savings would be from providing preventative care to the uninsured. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid. State obesity rates ranged from 18.7% to 30%. One July 2012 proposal advocated that consumers of healthcare always have \"skin in the game\" such that their costs rise as more services are provided. Address expensive chronic cases\nThe CBO reported in May 2005: \"Medicare spending is highly concentrated, with a small number of beneficiaries accounting for a large proportion of the Medicare program's annual expenditures. In 2001, the costliest 5 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) sector accounted for 43 percent of total spending, while the costliest 25 percent...accounted for fully 85 percent of spending...These high-cost beneficiaries, compared with beneficiaries in the bottom 75 percent in terms of their spending, were slightly older, more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes, and more likely to die in a given year.\" Market-based solutions\n\nPrivatize Medicare with a voucher system\nRep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill. Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program. The GAO reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) the following statistics regarding insurance competition in state markets: \"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota. The five largest carriers, when combined, represented three-quarters or more of the market in 19 of the 34 states supplying information, and they represented more than 90 percent in 7 of these states. Twenty-five of 37 states supplying information identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier offering health insurance in the small group market, and in all but one of the remaining 12 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 34 states supplying information was about 34 percent, with a range from about 3 percent in Vermont to about 89 percent in North Dakota; in 9 of these states BCBS carriers combined for half or more of the market.\" The GAO reported in 2008 (using 2007 data for the most part) the following statistics: \"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 27. The median market share of the largest carrier in the small group market was about\n47 percent, with a range from about 21 percent in Arizona to about 96 percent in Alabama. In 31 of the 39 states supplying market share information, the top carrier had a market share of a third or more. Thirty-six of the 44 states supplying information on the top carrier identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier, and in all but 1 of the remaining 8 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest carriers. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 38 states supplying this\ninformation was about 51 percent, with a range of less than 5 percent in Vermont and Wisconsin and more than 90 percent in Alabama and North Dakota...the median market share of all the BCBS carriers in 38 states reporting this information in 2008 was about 51 percent, compared to the 44 percent reported in 2005 and the 34 percent reported in 2002 for the 34 states supplying information in each of these years.\" Economist Paul Krugman argued that allowing interstate competition would create a \"race to the bottom,\" in which \"[t]he states with the weakest regulations – for example, those that allow insurance companies to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence – would set the standards for the nation as a whole. The result would be to afflict the afflicted, to make the lives of Americans with pre-existing conditions even harder.\" Gawande identified various revenue-enhancing approaches and profit-based incentives that doctors were using in high-cost areas that may have caused the over-utilization of healthcare. In August 2009, physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform was omitted from the Congressional health care reform bills then under consideration: \"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth.\" In 2004, the CBO studied restrictions on malpractice awards proposed by the George W. Bush Administration and members of Congress; CBO concluded that \"the evidence available to date does not make a strong case that restricting malpractice liability would have a significant effect, either positive or negative, on economic efficiency.\" An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a \"tiny band-aid at best,\" advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation. The U.S. had 2.3 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. There's absolutely no reason to force all primary-care providers to have an M.D.\" Tax reform\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:\n\nPeter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it. [w]ithout appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities\"\n\nPremium tax subsidies to help individuals purchase their own health insurance have also been suggested as a way to increase coverage rates. However, research also suggests that subsidies alone are unlikely to solve the uninsured problem in the U.S.\n\nGovernment action\n\nAddress Medicare fraud\nThe Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a \"high-risk\" government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. Estimates of Medicare fraud or \"improper payments\" vary. The Office of Management and Budget reported that $54 billion in \"improper payments\" were made to Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. CBO reported in October 2014 that it is difficult to quantify healthcare fraud related to government programs. CBO reported that: \"According to HHS, since 2009 the HEAT Medicare task\nforce has filed criminal and civil charges against more than 1,700 defendants who falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $5.5 billion.\" According to CBS News, Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and \"has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America.\" Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. Its enforcement budget is \"extremely limited\" according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\" The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims. During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types, including Medicare and Medicaid. President Obama has directed his administration to reduce these payments by $50 million annually by 2012, less than 1%. However, research suggests that current pay or play proposals are limited in their ability to increase coverage among the working poor. Proposed reforms would prohibit health insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. Arguing against requiring individuals to buy coverage, the Cato Institute has asserted that the Massachusetts law forcing everyone to buy insurance has increased costs: \"Premiums are growing 21 to 46 percent faster than the national average, in part because Massachusetts' individual mandate has effectively outlawed affordable health plans.\" They also say that by prohibiting the use of health status in pricing, the Massachusetts law \"further increase[s] premiums for the young and healthy\" and, as the result of adverse selection, drives more comprehensive health plans out of the market. Massachusetts shows that such a mandate would oust millions from their low-cost health plans and force them to pay higher premiums.\" Writing in the New York Times opinion blog \"Room for Debate\" the single-payer health care advocate Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said that a coverage mandate would not be necessary within a single-payer system and that even within the context of current system she was \"troubled by the notion of an individual mandate.\" She described the Massachusetts mandates as \"a windfall for the insurance industry\" and wrote, \"Premiums are rising much faster than income, benefit packages are getting skimpier, and deductibles and co-payments are going up.\" In April 2009 the Boston Globe reported that the number of people seeking emergency room care and the cost of emergency room visits increased after the 2006 mandates went into effect (comparing 2005 to 2007). In August 2009 the Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts had \"the most expensive family health insurance premiums in the country.\" Premiums in Massachusetts increased by 40 percent from 2003 to 2008, compared to a national average increase of 33%. The report did not break out the amount of the increase since 2006, but as the Massachusetts reforms are often taken as a model for national reform, \"advocates on various sides of the issue said the report underscores the urgency of including cost controls in any large-scale federal or state overhaul.\" Addressing the issue when it was proposed in 1994, CBO wrote: \"A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate provision as Constitutional. He argues that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of pre-existing medical conditions. Former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities.

He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" A report published by the Commonwealth Fund in December 2007 examined 15 federal policy options and concluded that, taken together, they had the potential to reduce future increases in health care spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. These options included increased use of health information technology, research and incentives to improve medical decision making, reduced tobacco use and obesity, reforming the payment of providers to encourage efficiency, limiting the tax federal exemption for health insurance premiums, and reforming several market changes such as resetting the benchmark rates for Medicare Advantage plans and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices. During February 2010, President Obama updated his reform proposal, with modifications to the bills that had passed as of that time. Following the United States were Norway and Switzerland which spent over $5,250 per capita. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The annual rate of cost increases slowed during 2010 and 2011. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP have risen from 13.8% in 2000 to 17.9% by 2009, but remained at that level in 2010 and 2011. Reasons include, among others: \nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2012 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\nRising out-of-pocket payments;\nDeductibles (the amount a person pays before insurance begins to cover claims) have risen sharply. Workers must pay a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less; and\nThe proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006. If health insurance were cheaper, or the marketplace were structured so that most people bought health coverage for themselves rather than getting it with their jobs, people would be paid more and raises would be higher.\" Best practices\n\nIndependent advisory panels\nPresident Obama has proposed an \"Independent Medicare Advisory Panel\" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Former OMB Director Peter Orszag stated: \"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\" Pilot programs\nGawande wrote that Obamacare contains a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. Official budget scores of universal health care proposals state that most of its savings would be from providing preventative care to the uninsured. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid. State obesity rates ranged from 18.7% to 30%. One July 2012 proposal advocated that consumers of healthcare always have \"skin in the game\" such that their costs rise as more services are provided. Address expensive chronic cases\nThe CBO reported in May 2005: \"Medicare spending is highly concentrated, with a small number of beneficiaries accounting for a large proportion of the Medicare program's annual expenditures. In 2001, the costliest 5 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) sector accounted for 43 percent of total spending, while the costliest 25 percent...accounted for fully 85 percent of spending...These high-cost beneficiaries, compared with beneficiaries in the bottom 75 percent in terms of their spending, were slightly older, more likely to suffer from chronic conditions, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes, and more likely to die in a given year.\" Market-based solutions\n\nPrivatize Medicare with a voucher system\nRep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled in Medicare. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill. Medicaid recipients could also be provided with tax credits or subsidies to purchase their own private insurance, reducing incentives for them to remain in the program. The GAO reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) the following statistics regarding insurance competition in state markets: \"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota. The five largest carriers, when combined, represented three-quarters or more of the market in 19 of the 34 states supplying information, and they represented more than 90 percent in 7 of these states. Twenty-five of 37 states supplying information identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier offering health insurance in the small group market, and in all but one of the remaining 12 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 34 states supplying information was about 34 percent, with a range from about 3 percent in Vermont to about 89 percent in North Dakota; in 9 of these states BCBS carriers combined for half or more of the market.\" The GAO reported in 2008 (using 2007 data for the most part) the following statistics: \"The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 27. The median market share of the largest carrier in the small group market was about\n47 percent, with a range from about 21 percent in Arizona to about 96 percent in Alabama. In 31 of the 39 states supplying market share information, the top carrier had a market share of a third or more. Thirty-six of the 44 states supplying information on the top carrier identified a Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) carrier as the largest carrier, and in all but 1 of the remaining 8 states, a BCBS carrier was among the five largest carriers. The median market share of all the BCBS carriers in the 38 states supplying this\ninformation was about 51 percent, with a range of less than 5 percent in Vermont and Wisconsin and more than 90 percent in Alabama and North Dakota...the median market share of all the BCBS carriers in 38 states reporting this information in 2008 was about 51 percent, compared to the 44 percent reported in 2005 and the 34 percent reported in 2002 for the 34 states supplying information in each of these years.\" Economist Paul Krugman argued that allowing interstate competition would create a \"race to the bottom,\" in which \"[t]he states with the weakest regulations – for example, those that allow insurance companies to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence – would set the standards for the nation as a whole. The result would be to afflict the afflicted, to make the lives of Americans with pre-existing conditions even harder.\" Gawande identified various revenue-enhancing approaches and profit-based incentives that doctors were using in high-cost areas that may have caused the over-utilization of healthcare. In August 2009, physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform was omitted from the Congressional health care reform bills then under consideration: \"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth.\" In 2004, the CBO studied restrictions on malpractice awards proposed by the George W. Bush Administration and members of Congress; CBO concluded that \"the evidence available to date does not make a strong case that restricting malpractice liability would have a significant effect, either positive or negative, on economic efficiency.\" An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a \"tiny band-aid at best,\" advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation. The U.S. had 2.3 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. There's absolutely no reason to force all primary-care providers to have an M.D.\" Tax reform\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:\n\nPeter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it. [w]ithout appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities\"\n\nPremium tax subsidies to help individuals purchase their own health insurance have also been suggested as a way to increase coverage rates. However, research also suggests that subsidies alone are unlikely to solve the uninsured problem in the U.S.\n\nGovernment action\n\nAddress Medicare fraud\nThe Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a \"high-risk\" government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. Estimates of Medicare fraud or \"improper payments\" vary. The Office of Management and Budget reported that $54 billion in \"improper payments\" were made to Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. CBO reported in October 2014 that it is difficult to quantify healthcare fraud related to government programs. CBO reported that: \"According to HHS, since 2009 the HEAT Medicare task\nforce has filed criminal and civil charges against more than 1,700 defendants who falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $5.5 billion.\" According to CBS News, Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and \"has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America.\" Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. Its enforcement budget is \"extremely limited\" according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\" The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims. During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types, including Medicare and Medicaid. President Obama has directed his administration to reduce these payments by $50 million annually by 2012, less than 1%. However, research suggests that current pay or play proposals are limited in their ability to increase coverage among the working poor. Proposed reforms would prohibit health insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. Arguing against requiring individuals to buy coverage, the Cato Institute has asserted that the Massachusetts law forcing everyone to buy insurance has increased costs: \"Premiums are growing 21 to 46 percent faster than the national average, in part because Massachusetts' individual mandate has effectively outlawed affordable health plans.\" They also say that by prohibiting the use of health status in pricing, the Massachusetts law \"further increase[s] premiums for the young and healthy\" and, as the result of adverse selection, drives more comprehensive health plans out of the market. Massachusetts shows that such a mandate would oust millions from their low-cost health plans and force them to pay higher premiums.\" Writing in the New York Times opinion blog \"Room for Debate\" the single-payer health care advocate Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said that a coverage mandate would not be necessary within a single-payer system and that even within the context of current system she was \"troubled by the notion of an individual mandate.\" She described the Massachusetts mandates as \"a windfall for the insurance industry\" and wrote, \"Premiums are rising much faster than income, benefit packages are getting skimpier, and deductibles and co-payments are going up.\" In April 2009 the Boston Globe reported that the number of people seeking emergency room care and the cost of emergency room visits increased after the 2006 mandates went into effect (comparing 2005 to 2007). In August 2009 the Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts had \"the most expensive family health insurance premiums in the country.\" Premiums in Massachusetts increased by 40 percent from 2003 to 2008, compared to a national average increase of 33%. The report did not break out the amount of the increase since 2006, but as the Massachusetts reforms are often taken as a model for national reform, \"advocates on various sides of the issue said the report underscores the urgency of including cost controls in any large-scale federal or state overhaul.\" Addressing the issue when it was proposed in 1994, CBO wrote: \"A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate provision as Constitutional. He argues that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of pre-existing medical conditions. Former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson has also argued that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Some places, like Oregon for example, do explicitly ration Medicaid resources using medical priorities. Politicians on the right tend to be fearful of democratically elected governments becoming involved in rationing decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) makes similar arguments claiming for example that people like the late Senator Edward Kennedy received health care in the U.S. that would have been denied in countries which have government controlled health care, a claim that The Economist magazine said was \"dangerous\" and went on to say that \"The reality is that America, like Britain, already makes extensive use of rationing. Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would enable $200 billion per year in cost savings, primarily via insurance company overhead. Among the organizations in support of single-payer health care in the U.S. is Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), an organization of some 17,000 American physicians, medical students, and health professionals. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals. In March 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor). Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this. A study of the effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20–64 years old - 1 death per 830 people with insurance. Other studies, just as those examining the randomized distribution of Medicaid insurance to low-income people in Oregon in 2008, found no change in death rate. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13.4 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17.1 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (2.8 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year. Waste and fraud\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and Senior Medicare Patrols—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.

By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, the state of Virginia put pressure on Arlington County to fix the rights-of-way problems with the northern route. The state of Virginia agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required rights-of-way. In January 1936, after a delay of almost 18 months, Arlington County officials said construction would begin in a few months. Much of the construction was funded by the U.S. federal government.

In modern usage, the term \"Sudan\" is also used in a separate context to refer specifically to the geographic region comprising the present-day countries of the Sudan, including its western region which forms a part of the country, and South Sudan, which gained its independence in 2011. In order to avoid confusion, the term \"the Sudans\" is becoming the preferred option when describing this region. The Assembly met in Juba, The capital of Southern Sudan and Central Equatoria State. It was read at an open parliamentary session (sitting number 27-2011) of the Assembly in front of a large assembled audience at the Dr. John Garang Mausoleum in Juba, South Sudan. The month was also marked by ethnic violence in Juba and its environs. The villages of Katigiri and Wonduruba were inundated with refugees internally displaced by violence and looting in Juba County in February 2008. At least 750 people from Katigiri also relocated to Juba, the de facto metropolis of the county, during the looting. After the reorganisation of states decreed by President Salva Kiir Mayardit in 2015, Juba County became the Jubek State.\n\n"

Once completed, the improvements would double train capacity across the Hudson River to 48 trains per hour, allowing for additional high-speed rail service. As a result of the storm damage and the tunnels' age, component failures \n\n  Six tracks connect Newark Penn Station and the adjacent Dock Bridge over the Passaic River at 40.73472°N, -74.16417°W. The east span, opened in 1937, carries one outbound track, and the two Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) rapid transit tracks entering and leaving the station. Connection, extending service on some non-electrified trains which had previously terminated at Newark Penn Station to Hoboken. Between 1976 and 2010, the number of New Jersey Transit weekday trains crossing the Hudson using the North River Tunnels (under contract with Amtrak ) increased from 147 to 438. The other rail system crossing the Hudson was developed by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, partially in conjunction with the PRR, and taken over by PANYNJ in 1962, who rebranded the H&M as the PATH, a rapid transit system. Direct trans-Hudson rail service to Lower Manhattan from Newark Penn is provided by PATH with additional terminals at World Trade Center and Herald Square in Manhattan, and at Hoboken Terminal and Journal Square in Hudson County, New Jersey. In 1971 New Jersey Governor William T. Cahill proposed constructing another rail tunnel from Weehawken, New Jersey to 48th Street in Midtown Manhattan. There are three vehicular crossings of the lower Hudson River.\n\n"

LAC+USC operates one of only three burn centers in Los Angeles County and one of the few Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units in Southern California. LAC+USC is also the home of the Los Angeles County College of Nursing and Allied Health, which has prepared registered nurses for professional practice since its founding in 1895. Designed by the coalition of architects Allied Architects Association, its Art-Deco construction earned it the nickname the Great Stone Mother and had 3,000 patient beds.

The stairs and front entrance of the original LAC+USC Medical Center is seen in a scene in the 1993 film Blood In, Blood Out when one of the main characters is released after being treated for gunshot wounds. The exterior is also used in shots portraying Jessica Alba's hospital stay in the 2008 horror movie The Eye. The exterior can be seen towards the end of Hold Back the Dawn, when Georges visits Emmy after her accident.

Some of her works of art include ID-400, OMIAI♡, Costume, Schoolgirls, Costume, Cover, Masquerade, Recruit, Mirrors, and Facial Signature. Her work investigates human identity and especially gender roles and stereotypes in Japanese culture. Sawada's photographs are each part of a themed photo series in which she makes use of make-up and costume to dramatically alter her identity, such that each photograph appears to represent a different individual or group of individuals, when all subjects are Sawada herself. Sawada uses commercial photographers, photo booths, and her own studio environment with digital photo editing to represent hundreds of different identities. Tomoko's use of costume in her self-portraits draws inspiration from the work of Cindy Sherman. Her work also explores the way assumptions about personality are largely driven by Japanese cultural responses to gender, job occupation, and other socio-cultural stereotypes.\n\n"

The primary processes responsible for this differentiation are mantle melting, which leads to the formation of oceanic and continental crust, and crust recycling through plate tectonics. The present-day mantle, as sampled by oceanic basalts, exhibits significant chemical and isotopic variability. This evolution includes processes such as storage in a boundary layer, upwelling as a mantle plume, and partial melting to become ocean island basalt. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick.

        "context": "The chemical differentiation of the Earth's silicate mantle and crust involves several geological processes. The primary processes responsible for this differentiation are mantle melting, which leads to the formation of oceanic and continental crust, and crust recycling through plate tectonics. The present-day mantle, as sampled by oceanic basalts, exhibits significant chemical and isotopic variability. This evolution includes processes such as storage in a boundary layer, upwelling as a mantle plume, and partial melting to become ocean island basalt. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates.

He found that these children have a more difficult time inhibiting the truth. He postulated that lying requires increased brain activity compared to truth because the truth must be suppressed, essentially creating more work for the brain. The subjects were given $20 for participating, and told they would receive more money if they deceived the computer; however, none did. His studies showed that the inferior and superior prefrontal and anterior cingulate gyri and the parietal cortex showed increased activity during deception. In this study, independent component features were used to train the algorithms, achieving up to 90% accuracy on predicting a subjects response, when prompted to indicate with a button press whether they believed or disbelieved a given assertion. Brain Activation \nActivation of BA 40, the superior parietal lobe, the lateral left MRG, the striatum, and left thalamus was unique to truth while activation of the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum will be used to show a similar network for truth and lie. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. When looking into the different styles of lying we see differentiation in the locations of activation. Spontaneous lies require retrieval from the semantic and episodic memory to be able to quickly formulate a viable situation that remains in working memory while visual images are created to further hide the truth. The Parahippocampal cortex may be used in this process to generalize lies to situations because no cross-checking is needed. Newer studies have considered the salience of lying in a variety of situations. If a lie is of lower salience activation is broader and general while salient lies have specific activation in regions associated with inhibition and selection. Many areas are much more active in lying than truth possibly meaning its harder to retrieve false information compared to true memories because truth has more encoded retrieval cues. This pushback from the legal system may be based on the 1988 Federal Employment Polygraph Protection Act that acts to protect citizens from incriminating themselves and the right to silence. False memories are a barrier in validating witness testimonies. fMRI imaging is also being used to analyze brain activity during intentional lies. Findings have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activates when subjects are pretending to know information, but that the right anterior hippocampus activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. However, there are limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between truths and deceptions because these regions are common areas of executive control function; It is difficult to tell if the activation seen is due to the lie told, or something unrelated. Pros and Cons \nWhile fMRI studies on deception have claimed detection accuracy as high as 90% many have problems with implementing this style of detection. Only yes or no answers can be used which allows for flexibility in the truth and style of lying. When looking at deception specifically, there is little research on non-compliant individuals.

He found that these children have a more difficult time inhibiting the truth. He postulated that lying requires increased brain activity compared to truth because the truth must be suppressed, essentially creating more work for the brain. The subjects were given $20 for participating, and told they would receive more money if they deceived the computer; however, none did. His studies showed that the inferior and superior prefrontal and anterior cingulate gyri and the parietal cortex showed increased activity during deception. In this study, independent component features were used to train the algorithms, achieving up to 90% accuracy on predicting a subjects response, when prompted to indicate with a button press whether they believed or disbelieved a given assertion. Brain Activation \nActivation of BA 40, the superior parietal lobe, the lateral left MRG, the striatum, and left thalamus was unique to truth while activation of the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum will be used to show a similar network for truth and lie. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. When looking into the different styles of lying we see differentiation in the locations of activation. Spontaneous lies require retrieval from the semantic and episodic memory to be able to quickly formulate a viable situation that remains in working memory while visual images are created to further hide the truth. The Parahippocampal cortex may be used in this process to generalize lies to situations because no cross-checking is needed. Newer studies have considered the salience of lying in a variety of situations. If a lie is of lower salience activation is broader and general while salient lies have specific activation in regions associated with inhibition and selection. Many areas are much more active in lying than truth possibly meaning its harder to retrieve false information compared to true memories because truth has more encoded retrieval cues. This pushback from the legal system may be based on the 1988 Federal Employment Polygraph Protection Act that acts to protect citizens from incriminating themselves and the right to silence. False memories are a barrier in validating witness testimonies. fMRI imaging is also being used to analyze brain activity during intentional lies. Findings have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activates when subjects are pretending to know information, but that the right anterior hippocampus activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. However, there are limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between truths and deceptions because these regions are common areas of executive control function; It is difficult to tell if the activation seen is due to the lie told, or something unrelated. Pros and Cons \nWhile fMRI studies on deception have claimed detection accuracy as high as 90% many have problems with implementing this style of detection.

EEG is a non-invasive technique that measures electrical activity within the brain. Its non-invasive nature makes it a convenient tool for studying brain activity in humans. On the other hand, ECoG involves recording electrical activity directly on the cerebral cortex. Electrodes are then placed directly on the exposed cortical surface, allowing for more precise and localized measurements of brain activity. ECoG provides higher spatial resolution compared to EEG as it records activity from specific brain regions or even individual neurons. It is commonly used in research and clinical settings for studying epileptic seizures, mapping brain functions before surgical interventions, and investigating brain dynamics during cognitive tasks. However, ECoG is an invasive technique that requires a surgical procedure, making it less suitable for routine clinical applications. In summary, while EEG measures electrical brain activity through electrodes on the scalp, ECoG records electrical activity directly on the cerebral cortex following a craniotomy. The choice between these techniques depends on the specific research or clinical goals, considering factors such as invasiveness, spatial resolution, and accessibility. Recording techniques Old techniques to record brain activity using physical phenomena are already widespread in research and medicine. Electroencephalography (EEG) uses electrophysiology to measure electrical activity within the brain. This technique, with which Hans Berger first recorded brain electrical activity on a human in 1924, is non-invasive and uses electrodes placed on the scalp of the patient to record brain activity. Based on the same principle, electrocorticography (ECoG) requires a craniotomy to record electrical activity directly on the cerebral cortex. They are commonly used in the evaluation of epilepsy, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures. By analyzing the patterns and characteristics of the recorded brain waves, healthcare professionals can gain insights into these conditions and tailor treatment plans accordingly. The interpretation of EEG results requires expertise from trained healthcare professionals who consider various factors such as patient history, symptoms, and other test results. activity as they are placed over the corpus callosum, and do not represent either hemisphere adequately. It involves placing small electrodes on the patient's scalp, which detect and measure the electrical signals produced by the brain. It is commonly used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as epilepsy, seizures, sleep disorders, brain tumors, and brain injuries. These stimuli help in detecting abnormalities in brain activity. It is a safe and painless procedure that can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the brain. What is Nerve Conduction Study (NCS)? What is Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)? EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph, to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electrical potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The physician observes the electrical activity while inserting the electrode. Then the electrical activity when the muscle is at rest is studied. When a motor unit fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit. This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibers per motor unit, the type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is a common measurement made during this test. Patients with a permanent pacemaker or other such implanted stimulators such as deep brain stimulators or spinal cord stimulators must tell the examiner prior to the study. This system ensures that the naming of electrodes is consistent across laboratories. (A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording an EEG on infants.) During the EEG, a series of activation procedures may be used. These procedures may induce normal or abnormal EEG activity that might not otherwise be seen. These procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials against the background of ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. Signals can be recorded from cerebral cortex, brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. They are recorded by stimulating peripheral nerves, most commonly the tibial nerve, median nerve or ulnar nerve, typically with an electrical stimulus. The response is then recorded from the patient’s scalp. Because of the low amplitude of the signal once it reaches the patient’s scalp and the relatively high amount of electrical noise caused by background EEG, scalp muscle EMG or electrical devices in the room, the signal must be averaged. Typically, in the operating room, over 100 and up to 1,000 averages must be used to adequately resolve the evoked potential. This peak is recorded from the cortex when the median nerve is stimulated. It most likely corresponds to the signal reaching the somatosensory cortex. Dramatic increases in latency or decreases in amplitude are indicators of neurological dysfunction. Polysomnography is a comprehensive recording of the biophysiological changes that occur during sleep. Polysomnography is used to diagnose, or rule out, many types of sleep disorders including narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), REM behavior disorder, parasomnias, and most commonly sleep apnea. For the standard test the patient comes to a sleep lab in the early evening, and is introduced to the setting and “wired up” so that multiple channels of data can be recorded when he/she falls asleep. During the study, the technician observes sleep activity by looking at the video monitor and the computer screen that displays all the data second by second. For a given surgery, the set of modalities used depends on which neural structures are at risk. Processing and displaying of the electrophysiologic signals as they are picked up by the recording electrodes. The neurophysiologist can thus observe and document the electrophysiologic signals in realtime during the surgery. The signals change according to a various factors, including anesthesia, arterial pressure, tissue temperature, surgical stage, and tissue stresses. Differentiating the signal changes along these lines – with particular attention paid to stresses – is the joint task of the surgical triad: surgeon, anesthesiologist, and neurophysiologist. The most common applications are in spinal surgery, selected brain surgeries, carotid endarterectomy, ENT procedures, thyroid surgeries, and peripheral nerve surgery. For example, during any surgery on the thoracic or cervical spinal column, there is some risk to the spinal cord. A baseline is obtained, and if there are no significant changes, the assumption is that the spinal cord has not been injured. More recently TcMEP have also been used for spinal cord monitoring. This is the reverse of SSEP; the motor cortex is stimulated transcranially, and recordings made from muscles in the limbs, or from spinal cord caudal to the surgery. This allows direct monitoring of motor tracts in the spinal cord.\n\nQuestion: which technique measures the electrical activity of brain cells directly\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Firstly, they can raise awareness about the Hill-Burton Program and the availability of free medical care among the medically indigent population. Secondly, health system agencies can assist in identifying the Hill-Burton facilities in their area and determining the extent of their obligations to provide free care. This involves collaborating with the facilities and obtaining allocation plans, which outline the specific services and the number of individuals that can be treated for free. By actively participating in this process, health system agencies can ensure that the medically indigent population receives the appropriate level of care they are entitled to. Additionally, health system agencies can play a vital role in publicizing and promoting the available health care services offered through the Hill-Burton Program.

The Hill-Burton Program provides funds to facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and agencies for their building programs, with the obligation to provide a certain amount of uncompensated medical care to the medically indigent population. Firstly, they can raise awareness about the Hill-Burton Program and the availability of free medical care among the medically indigent population. Secondly, health system agencies can assist in identifying the Hill-Burton facilities in their area and determining the extent of their obligations to provide free care. This involves collaborating with the facilities and obtaining allocation plans, which outline the specific services and the number of individuals that can be treated for free. By actively participating in this process, health system agencies can ensure that the medically indigent population receives the appropriate level of care they are entitled to. Additionally, health system agencies can play a vital role in publicizing and promoting the available health care services offered through the Hill-Burton Program. Overall, health system agencies can act as intermediaries between the medically indigent population and the Hill-Burton facilities, effectively promoting and facilitating access to free medical care.

In the first four months of the war they sank more than 110 vessels. In addition to supply ships, the U-boats occasionally attacked British and Canadian warships. One U-boat sank the British carrier, while another managed to sink the battleship in her home anchorage of Scapa Flow.

The treacherous route around the North Cape of Norway was the site of many battles as the Germans continually tried to disrupt the convoys using U-boats, bombers, and surface ships. Following the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, U-boats sank shipping along the East Coast of the United States and Canada, the waters around Newfoundland, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. They were initially so successful that this became known among U-boat crews as the second happy time. Eventually, the institution of shore blackouts and an interlocking convoy system resulted in a drop in attacks and U-boats shifted their operations \n\n The 1939 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active since 1930.

On 29 March, the government banned the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as suspending all liquor licenses, and closing all bars. On 2 April, St. Lucians queued up in long lines outside the briefly opened shops, mostly ignoring the prime minister's calls to practice social distancing. On 5 April, the Prime Minister announced that St. Lucia would revert to a 10-hour 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew from 7 April through 13 April. Essential businesses would be allowed to operate from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., except during the Good Friday, Easter, and Easter Monday holidays. The government added hardware and home supply stores to the list of businesses permitted to operate, to allow preparation for the drought and hurricane season. Prime Minister Chastanet was asked about lifting the alcohol restriction. Chastanet would look in it, but wanted to follow the advice by the Chief Medical Officer. On 18 May, the Ministry of Commerce permitted businesses to resume full operations during normal business hours. On 12 June, it was announced that starting 15 June, as part of government's phased re-opening, the curfew would be adjusted from beginning at 9 pm to beginning at 12 am through 5 am; social gatherings would be allowed and those with licenses would be allowed to sell liquor. Visitors are allowed to stay at up to two of the COVID-19 certified hotels and resorts on the island and may enjoy water-based activities. Officials stated stated concerns about community spread. The Royal Saint Lucian Police Force (RSLPF) announced zero tolerance enforcement of COVID-19 protocols starting 12 October. On 16 October, the Ministry of Education closed all schools for one week and Castries Comprehensive Secondary School for two weeks, after a student at CCSS tested positive for COVID-19. Later on 16 October, a worker at the secondary school also tested positive. Persons are advised to work from home where possible. Businesses are ordered to cease commercial activity at 9 p.m. unless exempted. On-premises alcohol consumption is prohibited, with grab and go sales permitted. Restaurants and bars must close at 9 p.m. Businesses must close at 9 p.m.  Alcohol sales are limited to grab and go while bars must close at 4 p.m.  All sporting events are also suspended. Including public gyms. Starting on 14 November, the RSLPF hired 200 wardens to enforce compliance with COVID-19 protocols in communities with the power of arrest. Business operating hours will be extended. Schools are to remain closed for in-person instruction with limited exceptions. Christmas parties of any kind will be prohibited. At the same time, Chief Medical Officer Belmar-George announced that St. Lucia has turned down the curve on COVID-19 transmission, but she also noted that the Christmas season presents a period of high risk. 2021\n\nJanuary 2021 \nOn 31 January 2021, eight inmates and one staff member at the Bordelais Correctional Facility tested positive for COVID-19, with one inmate dying on 4 February.

There was a reduction of licence types to seven and permits to five. In 1997, annual licence fees charged on liquor sales were abolished. It is legal for a person under 18 years to drink alcohol within private premises, with the supervision of a parent/guardian. It is illegal for a person under the age of 18 years to purchase alcohol, or to have alcohol bought for them in public places, or to attend a licensed venue without parental supervision (there are some special circumstances). It is illegal for licensed premises to sell alcohol to someone under the age of 18 years. Service hours were restricted from 1 July 2016. The sale or service of liquor must stop at 2am state-wide, except in \"safe night precincts\" where alcohol can be served until 3am. In all venues, the sale or service of rapid intoxication drinks must end at midnight. Detoxification may or may not be indicated depending upon an individuals age, medical status, for example, a young man who binge drinks and seeks treatment one week after his last use of alcohol may not require detoxification before beginning treatment for alcoholism. Benzodiazepines are the most common family of drugs used for alcohol detoxification, benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam or oxazepam are the most commonly used drugs used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. A third option is to defer treatment until symptoms occur and this method should not be used in patients with prior, alcohol-related seizures. Lorazepam or diazepam is available as an injection for patients who cannot safely take medications by mouth and oxazepam are indicated in patients with impaired liver function because they are metabolised outside of the liver. Nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for alcohol withdrawal, over 20,000 cases of the alcoholic withdrawal state have been successfully treated with psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide in South Africa and Finland. Alcohol tolerance refers to the bodily responses to the functional effects of ethanol in alcoholic beverages. This includes direct tolerance, speed of recovery from insobriety and resistance to the development of alcoholism, Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking. This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the effects as before tolerance was established. Alcohol tolerance may lead to alcohol dependency, heavy alcohol consumption over a period of years can lead to reverse tolerance. A liver can be damaged by chronic alcohol use, leading to a buildup of fat, the reduced ability of such a liver to metabolize or break down alcohol means that small amounts can lead to a high blood alcohol concentration and more rapid intoxication. Direct alcohol tolerance is largely dependent on body size, large-bodied people will require more alcohol to reach insobriety than lightly built people. Thus men, being larger than women on average, will have a higher alcohol tolerance, the alcohol tolerance is connected with activity of alcohol dehydrogenases in the liver, and in the bloodstream. High level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity results in fast transformation of ethanol to more toxic acetaldehyde, such atypical alcohol dehydrogenase levels are less frequent in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics and, alongside other symptoms, can indicate various forms of liver disease. Furthermore, among alcoholics, the carriers of this atypical enzyme consume lower ethanol doses, the tolerance to alcohol is not equally distributed throughout the worlds population, and genetics of alcohol dehydrogenase indicate resistance has arisen independently in different cultures. In North America, Native Americans have the highest probability of developing alcoholism compared to Europeans and Asians, higher body masses and the prevalence of high levels of alcohol dehydrogenase in an individual increase alcohol tolerance. An estimated one out of twenty people have an alcohol flush reaction and it is not in any way an indicator for the drunkenness of an individual. It is colloquially known as face flush, a condition where the body metabolizes alcohol nearly 100-times more efficiently into acetaldehyde, flushing, or blushing, is associated with the erythema of the face and shoulder, after consumption of alcohol.

Australia Germany Hong Kong India United Kingdom Some countries forbid alcoholic beverages, people trying to get around prohibition turn to smuggling of alcohol – known as bootlegging or rum-running – or make moonshine, a distilled beverage in an unlicensed still. Canada imposed prohibition at the beginning of the 20th century, in India, sale and/or consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar, Gujarat and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. Prohibition has become controversial in Gujarat, following a July 2009 episode in which widespread poisoning resulted from alcohol that had been sold illegally, all Indian states observe dry days on major religious festivals/occasions depending on the popularity of the festival in that region. Dry Days are specific days when the sale of alcohol is banned, dry days are observed on voting days. Dry Days are fixed by the state government. National holidays such as Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanthi are usually dry days throughout India, two Nordic countries had a period of alcohol prohibition in the early 20th century. Some of these restrictions have since been lifted, for example, supermarkets in Finland are allowed to sell only fermented beverages with an alcohol content up to 4. 7% ABV, but Alko, the government monopoly, is allowed to sell wine and spirits. This is the case with the Norwegian Vinmonopolet and the Swedish Systembolaget, in the United States, there was an attempt from 1919 to 1933 to eliminate the drinking of alcoholic beverages by means of a national prohibition of their manufacture and sale. This period became known as the Prohibition era, during this time, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States made the manufacture and transportation of alcoholic beverages illegal throughout the United States. Dipsomania is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol. In the 19th century, dipsomania was a variety of alcohol-related problems, dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as the most medical of the terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century. Over time, the term became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness.

Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. In fact, I just had to email her the last night I worked to once again reset me. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) Have hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. I have pondered this often. Just what is my motive for the things I do? They will fly. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate. Our son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. I have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\" The thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. Our dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? When my own father died, a close friend called the next morning. His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" There was nothing better that could have been said. So let us have hope and not fear that passage before us. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home. My husband thought I said \"sun\". He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. We have total and complete faith in the sun that it will continue to come up every morning and set every evening. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. I have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. Finally he moved away from the window and watched her on the big screen television above the window. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love. I see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning. Don't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). For the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. The slight coolness of the air, that hint of crispness in the morning, is the hope of something yet to be. So these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). As as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. I guess it was inevitable with a nickname of \"Frannie\" that when I became a grandmother I would be called \"Grannie Frannie.\" Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren. Emma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend. I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8). Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I love you, Grannie Frannie!\" I truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Let me tell you about Irene. slowly he knew he had plenty of time to go back and get it. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. But I answered her questions: Did I just leave work? Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. .warm, sweet and irresistible. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. By the time we checked out, we felt as if we had known her forever. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. They motioned for the Nicholls State players on the field to join them and together the two teams prayed for the wounded player. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. .no matter which uniform he was wearing. Before he was wheeled away to the hospital, the player on the cart waved to the fans to let them know he was better than we thought and again applause erupted from the stands. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. .I wonder if that plane will actually land or will it crash? For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. Not all of those who died were Americans, either. No wonder this attack shook the world. I remember one of the most touching scenes to me during that time was when the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later. For this attack which killed more people than the attack on Pearl Harbor, let us pledge to never forget those who died that day. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Let us remember their honor and sacrifice. As the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. Stories abound of off-duty firefighters and police officers who threw their equipment into whatever conveyance they could find and made it somehow to Ground Zero. Many who did so never returned. We have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. In the 1960's the Andy Griffith show used to feature commercials in which the characters of the show would act out endorsements of various products. Somewhere during the commercial, Andy would pronounce the product as \"Gooood.\" His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good. Or as Andy Griffith would have said, \"He's real goooood!\" When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" Of course, I knew it wasn't going to happen that way. There was little sleep. The first night, someone came in my room for some reason or other at least every hour during the night. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's voice. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. There is no safe haven apart from Him. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Then he asked her about me, \"Is she a charge nurse or something?\" Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave. Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He watered them. He fed them. He could tell you at any given time how many tomatoes were on the vines. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. My trek to Labor and Delivery was in every way unexpected. I had other plans. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. A few weeks before I was to leave home I decided I just didn't want to go. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I couldn't take it in night school either. Ouch! Another ouch! The next fall I started the nursing program and graduated without any problems, even though falling in love during that time presented a huge distraction. God has a sense of humor, doesn't He? Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. I have been in about 2800 deliveries. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! Never could I have imagined my life would have taken the turns it has, and as I reflect on the wisdom of our God on this Labor Day, I can only thank and praise Him for His leading in my life. I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Before the day is over, I plan to stop by there just to order my coffee! Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. The pace of time sped up. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Your life is more than half over. Then the frightening thought begins.. . It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\" This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. \"This is how long you have left to live!\" But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. Introduction: Dr. Martha Cottrell is a respected physician who travels extensively lecturing on health promotion and disease prevention. BL: I thought that we might explore several areas. Well, my focus at this time in my life is really coming together with women’s issues. The male is the expendable part. The male goes out and fights the wars, hunts, does whatever. MC: Well, whatever the cause, I think that what I’m concerned about, first of all, is that there is not an awareness of the importance of this message. Which is almost self-hatred of ourselves as women, in an attempt to be male-like. What is this female energy? We are losing that power. MC: There is always an emotional overlay with illness. We tend to think we can separate mind, body, spirit, and emotions. But we can’t. Anytime there is an illness, I think we have to be very sensitive. What does this message [disease] mean? Breast cancer is an example. BL: Why do people come to see you in particular? MC: Well, you have to realize that by virtue of who I am, I’m going to attract certain kinds of patients. Many, many people come to me with physical problems because it’s their entrée. But also, at some level of their consciousness, they have chosen to come to me because they know that I’m operating on a level other than the physical. What is it that you do in your practice? MC: I mostly facilitate. I don’t treat anybody. MC: I don’t do that kind of medicine any more. BL: What led to your transition? I had two children before I went to college. I had worked. I had been in life, I had lived life. I didn’t go from high school to college to medical school. I experienced my parents’ illnesses, my children’s illnesses, and my own illnesses. And if you ask how, you can manipulate it. I wanted to know the cause. I began to see that there’s some connection. And I became aware that there was a whole body of knowledge out there that I didn’t know anything about. Sometimes I would say to them, “I really think this is a racket. I think you’re being exploited. It’s up to you, but for myself this doesn’t seem legitimate to me.” We’d have that kind of exchange. So then in my own evolution, when my own illness came about because of my lifestyle – and that’s a whole other story that I’m going to write one of these days – but when the time came for me to reflect on my own illness and what I was going to do about it, I realized that I didn’t want what I had to offer. I had never heard of it. I was scheduled to go to Washington to a regular medical A.M.A.-promoted thing. I said, “Oh, John, I would love to go but I am already supposed to go down here.” And he said, “I really think it would be very beneficial if you would go.” I had so much respect for him, there was just some energy there that I said OK. I canceled the other one and I went with him. And that really turned my life around. I became aware of a lot of options and it was really fascinating for me. That was when I began to explore other options. Other people came into my life “accidentally” that told me about this one or that one. I put that in the back of my mind, but I didn’t do anything about it. So I decided I would go find this woman. When I went to see Ilana, I said, “I’ve heard about your work and I’d really like to study with you. I’d like to learn your techniques so that I could help my patients.” That was my access point. I could not walk in and say, “Ilana, I need help.” It’s so interesting how we find our way. So I said, “May I study with you? I want to learn your technique. And she smiled and said, “Of course.” And I began to study with her. It took me about two years before I got the message that I was there to help myself. She facilitated the raising of my consciousness and I realized that I needed to get out of New York City. Then I quickly grabbed it out of the trash can for fear I might miss something. I went through it and saw an advertisement for a position in a rural health initiative. So I took it home and I looked at where it was on the map and it looked like a fascinating area. I went down to Hyde County which is in North Carolina right on the coast, a very rural area. While I was sitting in the waiting room, I picked up the Saturday Evening Post and read Satillaro’s article. So then I went back to New York. I realized that everything I was doing in North Carolina was acute crisis intervention. I would try to teach people and they didn’t want to hear what I had to say. “OK, Doc, that sounds real good, but what can you do for me now? That sounds real interesting, Doc, but you know I’ve really got to have something for this.” And I realized those patients weren’t ready for what I had to offer. That’s how I learned. That’s how I taught myself. If this doctor says there must be something to it, I want to look into it. Pure and simple. Simply because of the little M.D. MC: Oh, most of what I use in my lectures comes from Western medical research. I was very fortunate. Again, things don’t just happen, they’re always meant to be, in my opinion. You see, I was able to manipulate my workplace so that it was balanced for me. I was giving the students the Western medicine they needed, but I couldn’t deal with it so I provided somebody that could. And on the other hand, being the director, I had the opportunity to develop a program in health promotion. So that satisfied me. BL: You’ve talked a lot about prevention and educating children in your lectures. Could you describe your ideas about these areas? MC: Well, as far as my interest at this time of my life, it’s really in women’s issues and children’s issues. It’s just, as I see it, another direction of the extended family. In a way, it’s very exciting in that the extended family is going to have to be really extended if we’re going to have a healthy society. It’s not just going to be blood kin. This is a challenge. They’re decked out in a different form, but the principles are there. That person is putting a great deal into the society. If your husband died, you had no skills, and you were lost. Both boys and girls need their fathers. We are in a most exciting time. But, I think things will get worse before they get better. MC: I’m in transition myself right now. So my dream is that my so-called practice of medicine will be less and less and less. And that my writing and teaching will be more and more and more. BL: You spoke of studying with Michio Kushi. MC: Oh, yes. I have it and I go back and read it and reread it. It takes time for all that to soak in, but I think it’s a great book. I get every one that I see. BL: Some people, particularly women in American/European culture, have a little difficulty with some of Ohsawa’s views. MC: You know, you have to understand the historical aspects of anything before you can understand why we are where we are. So for me to read and study Ohsawa helps me to understand better where we are now and gives me the perspective that will help me to know where we’re going to go in the future. I just take it in. It’s history. It’s just like we’re trying to do with Columbus. I don’t care how we want to write him up. Columbus did what he did. And I think it’s sad that we try to change history. When we studied history, we didn’t just memorize dates. We talked about the social climate, the political climate, and the economic climate of this country. What generated it? What was the fertile ground for generating this disruption or this progress or whatever? If we could present history that way to our children, I think they would be far better citizens. Because, as I said, we must know where we came from before we know where we’re going. BL: Thanks very much for your time. using the children of Capitol leaders as revenge.

He, thankfully, endured the rest of the therapy and we were sent home. Once we pass that point and can see some improvement, I think we'll rest much easier. However, if there is little to no improvement, they will begin a harsher treatment to combat it and prepare him for a SCT, so we were hoping to find out from someone who has had similar circumstances what THAT may be like. Thank you, my friend. so, I appreciate your sharing very much! Terry, thankfully, is pretty much the same as he was the day of. His hair will probably go, I think that's a given, right? He doesn't want to do anything about it until the 12th; hoping we won't have to shave it off. if you even did? did you allow yourself to shed a few tears over it all, or were you one of those \"I can do anything\" and keep your emotions at bay through it? I agree with po18guy about each experience being unique. Although everyone responds a bit differently, for me, the first round was the easiest. After round two I was still doing pretty well and was able to take a week-end trip to Austin with some family and explore the area. Each subsequent round took a toll on my energy levels. Whatever comes, I think it is safe to say it is a life-altering experience for both of you! Your journey is not easy, but from what I understand, the odds are very good that he can get cured-especially if he doesn't have the Double-hit or Double-expressor sub-types that are more resistant to the current treatments available. How can I ever thank you, Scubamom? Your story gives us so much inspiration and courage to face what lies ahead. But the information is exactly what we were hoping to find in joining this site. You might try something. I'll bet that you cross all, or nearly all of them off. If some are rather silly, you will be able to recognize that. It gives you the power to write them down and \"destroy\" them by crossing them off. It lets you know that, while completely natural, worry is very counterproductive. When you ponder those crossed-off worries, you might just notice a trace of hope and empowerment creeping in. So, I worked. However, when I began the second two months of treatment with a different regimen, I knew it was time to stay home. I was beat up by the side effects. And, treatment does not last forever. If he can still grow some facial hair, a goatee (or even a soul patch) is really cool with a bald head. My 2¢. At the least, it is cathartic. My faith had prepared me for death, but death never came. So, I just kept on living. You are one tough dude. Thank you for sharing more of your personal experiences. Will probably write more in the days to follow. In the meanwhile, know that we are encouraged and inspired. You can read this on a rainy day. Its nice of Po to share his experiences over and over and over and over again and I believe it is helpful to many. I know I have learned from him. No doubt though his struggles are the stuff of legends and the bards will surely sing of his glories when he is gone. I guess its up each of us To carry on as best we can. i am going down to the creek to catch lunch. My very best to everyone, especially PO. I am the eternal skeptic but well meaning. Since you are expert in \"all things Po,\" Shady, perhaps if what he writes is not to your taste, you could avoid reading his posts ? Often the issue people are most challanged by is the issue of hope. What does this have to do with you? If you must know what made me look into this whole PO thing was his assertion that cancer was good to him and that if he could go back in time and choose whether or not to have cancer he would choose to have it. That is perverse in my opinion and tells me what he is all about. Cancer is not a good thing and no one who thinks it is should go unchallenged. I will pull that quote and re post it. If I survive this, which looks unlikely at this point, I will move on. You and Po have been disease free for many years yet still hang out here. You always challenge the lawyers. quote from PO December 2017 - “If I had to go back 9 years and choose health or cancer, I would take the cancer. No one has to read anything. Very true indeed. Why do you read my posts? I have no problem with taking a bad situation with a very serious disease and turning it into a cottage industry. Just kidding, really. To deny yourself any one of those things is to deny yourself a step in coping. As I said, my husband and I both have had to learn the hard way what it is to fight . fight for decent medical care, fight for yourself and that special someone you love. Long story. Although, in doing that . a lot of our suffering, the time we lost with our family through some of the sweetest moments we should have been able to share will never be recovered. It has left us both \"scarred\". It has forever changed me (both in good ways and bad). But he has been with us for a good 12 years that may never been shared if I hadn't turned into the queen \"B\". I begged, did hours of research into the wee hours of the morning after putting in a full day's work, layering bed sheets due to drenching night sweats he suffered from . nearly lost my heart and my mind in the process. He wrote back to me and said there was something seriously wrong with my husband and that I should not give up in my search for an answer to his declining health. He said my husband was lucky to have me. That support, offered to me in broken English from a different continent, emboldened me to keep going. It was then, while lying in ICU just before what was to be one of the sweetest moments in our young daughter's life . they sent in a doctor we should have had access to years earlier . who said he believed Terry had been suffering from Hepatitis C all this time, which caused the kidney disease. I was furious. It is my belief, after seeing the worst of the worst in both of those fields, first-hand, a person HAS to . You have to walk the fine line between being composed and overwrought with emotion. It all hardened me. It forever changed me in ways I can't even begin to articulate. we are fighting once again. I find that ridiculous and cruel. I acknowledge what has happened to us and our family. I \"ACKNOWLEDGE\" this latest challenge as well; but there is NO way I will ever \"accept\" it. I reject it with every fiber in my body and soul. It comes from somewhere dark and UNacceptable. We both have our positions in hell again with all of it; but this time around . Living in hell, in separate corners there . only isolates each of us and we are of no use to each other thinking one of us should suffer this or that in private. I apologize for the length of this post; but I hope it is a story that may inspire and embolden others in their journey through ill health. I, too, have a story worth sharing about my own brush with cancer that, again, with the strength and courage I found when fighting for my husband . may inspire as well. I shall save it for another day. In the meanwhile . I value and appreciate each and every comment and any interest anyone has had in this our story. You dissertation was so beautifully written that I just felt compelled to compliment it. The English philosopher Sor Francis Bacon once wrote that writing maketh an exact man. Soon, people will just be able to grunt and point at things; emojis are a definite move toward this. I was not yet married, but my mom did for me in essence what you did for yor husband. Thank you, my friend. Your story, also, inspires beyond measure. Your story, so filled with courage, endurance and love is one meant to share with others who may feel hope is lost through their own challenges. My mother always told me to follow my heart. Although she passed years ago, her strength and sweet nature is one of my inspirations to always listen to what you know is the direction to take, even though it may not be the easiest choice to make. I wish you nothing but continued good health and peace. And, I look forward to more exchanges with you to learn from your courage and determination. Your story is beyond imagination, please know that you are welcome here and that we are very supportIive of you and your dear husband and all you have been through. Please stay with us and keep us informed, we are very concerned and hoping for the best. Thank you for your interest, illead! I will be sure to share as we travel this uncertain journey. When able, I would be most interested in learning more about yours and how you managed it all.\n\nQuestion: who is the letter from in mockingjay part 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. In fact, I just had to email her the last night I worked to once again reset me. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) Have hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. I have pondered this often. Just what is my motive for the things I do? They will fly. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate. Our son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. I have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\" The thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. Our dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? When my own father died, a close friend called the next morning. His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" There was nothing better that could have been said. So let us have hope and not fear that passage before us. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home. My husband thought I said \"sun\". He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. We have total and complete faith in the sun that it will continue to come up every morning and set every evening. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. I have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. Finally he moved away from the window and watched her on the big screen television above the window. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love. I see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning. Don't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). For the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. The slight coolness of the air, that hint of crispness in the morning, is the hope of something yet to be. So these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). As as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. I guess it was inevitable with a nickname of \"Frannie\" that when I became a grandmother I would be called \"Grannie Frannie.\" Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren. Emma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend. I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8). Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I love you, Grannie Frannie!\" I truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Let me tell you about Irene. slowly he knew he had plenty of time to go back and get it. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. But I answered her questions: Did I just leave work? Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. .warm, sweet and irresistible. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. By the time we checked out, we felt as if we had known her forever. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. They motioned for the Nicholls State players on the field to join them and together the two teams prayed for the wounded player. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. .no matter which uniform he was wearing. Before he was wheeled away to the hospital, the player on the cart waved to the fans to let them know he was better than we thought and again applause erupted from the stands. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. .I wonder if that plane will actually land or will it crash? For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. Not all of those who died were Americans, either. No wonder this attack shook the world. I remember one of the most touching scenes to me during that time was when the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later. For this attack which killed more people than the attack on Pearl Harbor, let us pledge to never forget those who died that day. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Let us remember their honor and sacrifice. As the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. Stories abound of off-duty firefighters and police officers who threw their equipment into whatever conveyance they could find and made it somehow to Ground Zero. Many who did so never returned. We have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. In the 1960's the Andy Griffith show used to feature commercials in which the characters of the show would act out endorsements of various products. Somewhere during the commercial, Andy would pronounce the product as \"Gooood.\" His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good. Or as Andy Griffith would have said, \"He's real goooood!\" When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" Of course, I knew it wasn't going to happen that way. There was little sleep. The first night, someone came in my room for some reason or other at least every hour during the night. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's voice. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. There is no safe haven apart from Him. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Then he asked her about me, \"Is she a charge nurse or something?\" Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave. Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He watered them. He fed them. He could tell you at any given time how many tomatoes were on the vines. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. My trek to Labor and Delivery was in every way unexpected. I had other plans. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. A few weeks before I was to leave home I decided I just didn't want to go. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I couldn't take it in night school either. Ouch! Another ouch! The next fall I started the nursing program and graduated without any problems, even though falling in love during that time presented a huge distraction. God has a sense of humor, doesn't He? Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. I have been in about 2800 deliveries. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! Never could I have imagined my life would have taken the turns it has, and as I reflect on the wisdom of our God on this Labor Day, I can only thank and praise Him for His leading in my life. I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Before the day is over, I plan to stop by there just to order my coffee! Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. The pace of time sped up. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Your life is more than half over. Then the frightening thought begins.. . It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\" This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. \"This is how long you have left to live!\" But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. Introduction: Dr. Martha Cottrell is a respected physician who travels extensively lecturing on health promotion and disease prevention. BL: I thought that we might explore several areas. Well, my focus at this time in my life is really coming together with women’s issues. The male is the expendable part. The male goes out and fights the wars, hunts, does whatever. MC: Well, whatever the cause, I think that what I’m concerned about, first of all, is that there is not an awareness of the importance of this message. Which is almost self-hatred of ourselves as women, in an attempt to be male-like. What is this female energy? We are losing that power. MC: There is always an emotional overlay with illness. We tend to think we can separate mind, body, spirit, and emotions. But we can’t. Anytime there is an illness, I think we have to be very sensitive. What does this message [disease] mean? Breast cancer is an example. BL: Why do people come to see you in particular? MC: Well, you have to realize that by virtue of who I am, I’m going to attract certain kinds of patients. Many, many people come to me with physical problems because it’s their entrée. But also, at some level of their consciousness, they have chosen to come to me because they know that I’m operating on a level other than the physical. What is it that you do in your practice? MC: I mostly facilitate. I don’t treat anybody. MC: I don’t do that kind of medicine any more. BL: What led to your transition? I had two children before I went to college. I had worked. I had been in life, I had lived life. I didn’t go from high school to college to medical school. I experienced my parents’ illnesses, my children’s illnesses, and my own illnesses. And if you ask how, you can manipulate it. I wanted to know the cause. I began to see that there’s some connection. And I became aware that there was a whole body of knowledge out there that I didn’t know anything about. Sometimes I would say to them, “I really think this is a racket. I think you’re being exploited. It’s up to you, but for myself this doesn’t seem legitimate to me.” We’d have that kind of exchange. So then in my own evolution, when my own illness came about because of my lifestyle – and that’s a whole other story that I’m going to write one of these days – but when the time came for me to reflect on my own illness and what I was going to do about it, I realized that I didn’t want what I had to offer. I had never heard of it. I was scheduled to go to Washington to a regular medical A.M.A.-promoted thing. I said, “Oh, John, I would love to go but I am already supposed to go down here.” And he said, “I really think it would be very beneficial if you would go.” I had so much respect for him, there was just some energy there that I said OK. I canceled the other one and I went with him. And that really turned my life around. I became aware of a lot of options and it was really fascinating for me. That was when I began to explore other options. Other people came into my life “accidentally” that told me about this one or that one. I put that in the back of my mind, but I didn’t do anything about it. So I decided I would go find this woman. When I went to see Ilana, I said, “I’ve heard about your work and I’d really like to study with you. I’d like to learn your techniques so that I could help my patients.” That was my access point. I could not walk in and say, “Ilana, I need help.” It’s so interesting how we find our way. So I said, “May I study with you? I want to learn your technique. And she smiled and said, “Of course.” And I began to study with her. It took me about two years before I got the message that I was there to help myself. She facilitated the raising of my consciousness and I realized that I needed to get out of New York City. Then I quickly grabbed it out of the trash can for fear I might miss something. I went through it and saw an advertisement for a position in a rural health initiative. So I took it home and I looked at where it was on the map and it looked like a fascinating area. I went down to Hyde County which is in North Carolina right on the coast, a very rural area. While I was sitting in the waiting room, I picked up the Saturday Evening Post and read Satillaro’s article. So then I went back to New York. I realized that everything I was doing in North Carolina was acute crisis intervention. I would try to teach people and they didn’t want to hear what I had to say. “OK, Doc, that sounds real good, but what can you do for me now? That sounds real interesting, Doc, but you know I’ve really got to have something for this.” And I realized those patients weren’t ready for what I had to offer. That’s how I learned. That’s how I taught myself. If this doctor says there must be something to it, I want to look into it. Pure and simple. Simply because of the little M.D. MC: Oh, most of what I use in my lectures comes from Western medical research. I was very fortunate. Again, things don’t just happen, they’re always meant to be, in my opinion. You see, I was able to manipulate my workplace so that it was balanced for me. I was giving the students the Western medicine they needed, but I couldn’t deal with it so I provided somebody that could. And on the other hand, being the director, I had the opportunity to develop a program in health promotion. So that satisfied me. BL: You’ve talked a lot about prevention and educating children in your lectures. Could you describe your ideas about these areas? MC: Well, as far as my interest at this time of my life, it’s really in women’s issues and children’s issues. It’s just, as I see it, another direction of the extended family. In a way, it’s very exciting in that the extended family is going to have to be really extended if we’re going to have a healthy society. It’s not just going to be blood kin. This is a challenge. They’re decked out in a different form, but the principles are there. That person is putting a great deal into the society. If your husband died, you had no skills, and you were lost. Both boys and girls need their fathers. We are in a most exciting time. But, I think things will get worse before they get better. MC: I’m in transition myself right now. So my dream is that my so-called practice of medicine will be less and less and less. And that my writing and teaching will be more and more and more. BL: You spoke of studying with Michio Kushi. MC: Oh, yes. I have it and I go back and read it and reread it. It takes time for all that to soak in, but I think it’s a great book. I get every one that I see. BL: Some people, particularly women in American/European culture, have a little difficulty with some of Ohsawa’s views. MC: You know, you have to understand the historical aspects of anything before you can understand why we are where we are. So for me to read and study Ohsawa helps me to understand better where we are now and gives me the perspective that will help me to know where we’re going to go in the future. I just take it in. It’s history. It’s just like we’re trying to do with Columbus. I don’t care how we want to write him up. Columbus did what he did. And I think it’s sad that we try to change history. When we studied history, we didn’t just memorize dates. We talked about the social climate, the political climate, and the economic climate of this country. What generated it? What was the fertile ground for generating this disruption or this progress or whatever? If we could present history that way to our children, I think they would be far better citizens. Because, as I said, we must know where we came from before we know where we’re going. BL: Thanks very much for your time. using the children of Capitol leaders as revenge. Katniss votes yes, under the condition that she can execute Snow. At Snow's execution, Katniss kills Coin instead, which causes a riot of citizens to lynch and kill Snow. Peeta stops Katniss from committing suicide and she is arrested.

Returning home to District 12, Katniss finds Peeta, who has almost fully recovered from his conditioning.

And what shall posterity \n\nMy husband was recently diagnosed with Germinal, Diffuse Non-Hodgkins Large B-Cell Lymphoma, late Stage III/early Stage IV. He, thankfully, endured the rest of the therapy and we were sent home. Once we pass that point and can see some improvement, I think we'll rest much easier. However, if there is little to no improvement, they will begin a harsher treatment to combat it and prepare him for a SCT, so we were hoping to find out from someone who has had similar circumstances what THAT may be like. Thank you, my friend. so, I appreciate your sharing very much! Terry, thankfully, is pretty much the same as he was the day of. His hair will probably go, I think that's a given, right? He doesn't want to do anything about it until the 12th; hoping we won't have to shave it off. if you even did? did you allow yourself to shed a few tears over it all, or were you one of those \"I can do anything\" and keep your emotions at bay through it? I agree with po18guy about each experience being unique. Although everyone responds a bit differently, for me, the first round was the easiest. After round two I was still doing pretty well and was able to take a week-end trip to Austin with some family and explore the area. Each subsequent round took a toll on my energy levels. Whatever comes, I think it is safe to say it is a life-altering experience for both of you! Your journey is not easy, but from what I understand, the odds are very good that he can get cured-especially if he doesn't have the Double-hit or Double-expressor sub-types that are more resistant to the current treatments available. How can I ever thank you, Scubamom? Your story gives us so much inspiration and courage to face what lies ahead. But the information is exactly what we were hoping to find in joining this site. You might try something. I'll bet that you cross all, or nearly all of them off. If some are rather silly, you will be able to recognize that. It gives you the power to write them down and \"destroy\" them by crossing them off. It lets you know that, while completely natural, worry is very counterproductive. When you ponder those crossed-off worries, you might just notice a trace of hope and empowerment creeping in. So, I worked. However, when I began the second two months of treatment with a different regimen, I knew it was time to stay home. I was beat up by the side effects. And, treatment does not last forever. If he can still grow some facial hair, a goatee (or even a soul patch) is really cool with a bald head. My 2¢. At the least, it is cathartic. My faith had prepared me for death, but death never came. So, I just kept on living. You are one tough dude. Thank you for sharing more of your personal experiences. Will probably write more in the days to follow. In the meanwhile, know that we are encouraged and inspired. You can read this on a rainy day. Its nice of Po to share his experiences over and over and over and over again and I believe it is helpful to many. I know I have learned from him. No doubt though his struggles are the stuff of legends and the bards will surely sing of his glories when he is gone. I guess its up each of us To carry on as best we can. i am going down to the creek to catch lunch. My very best to everyone, especially PO. I am the eternal skeptic but well meaning. Since you are expert in \"all things Po,\" Shady, perhaps if what he writes is not to your taste, you could avoid reading his posts ? Often the issue people are most challanged by is the issue of hope. What does this have to do with you? If you must know what made me look into this whole PO thing was his assertion that cancer was good to him and that if he could go back in time and choose whether or not to have cancer he would choose to have it. That is perverse in my opinion and tells me what he is all about. Cancer is not a good thing and no one who thinks it is should go unchallenged. I will pull that quote and re post it. If I survive this, which looks unlikely at this point, I will move on. You and Po have been disease free for many years yet still hang out here. You always challenge the lawyers. quote from PO December 2017 - “If I had to go back 9 years and choose health or cancer, I would take the cancer. No one has to read anything. Very true indeed. Why do you read my posts? I have no problem with taking a bad situation with a very serious disease and turning it into a cottage industry. Just kidding, really. To deny yourself any one of those things is to deny yourself a step in coping. As I said, my husband and I both have had to learn the hard way what it is to fight . fight for decent medical care, fight for yourself and that special someone you love. Long story. Although, in doing that . a lot of our suffering, the time we lost with our family through some of the sweetest moments we should have been able to share will never be recovered. It has left us both \"scarred\". It has forever changed me (both in good ways and bad). But he has been with us for a good 12 years that may never been shared if I hadn't turned into the queen \"B\". I begged, did hours of research into the wee hours of the morning after putting in a full day's work, layering bed sheets due to drenching night sweats he suffered from . nearly lost my heart and my mind in the process. He wrote back to me and said there was something seriously wrong with my husband and that I should not give up in my search for an answer to his declining health. He said my husband was lucky to have me. That support, offered to me in broken English from a different continent, emboldened me to keep going. It was then, while lying in ICU just before what was to be one of the sweetest moments in our young daughter's life . they sent in a doctor we should have had access to years earlier . who said he believed Terry had been suffering from Hepatitis C all this time, which caused the kidney disease. I was furious. It is my belief, after seeing the worst of the worst in both of those fields, first-hand, a person HAS to . You have to walk the fine line between being composed and overwrought with emotion. It all hardened me. It forever changed me in ways I can't even begin to articulate. we are fighting once again. I find that ridiculous and cruel. I acknowledge what has happened to us and our family. I \"ACKNOWLEDGE\" this latest challenge as well; but there is NO way I will ever \"accept\" it. I reject it with every fiber in my body and soul. It comes from somewhere dark and UNacceptable. We both have our positions in hell again with all of it; but this time around . Living in hell, in separate corners there . only isolates each of us and we are of no use to each other thinking one of us should suffer this or that in private. I apologize for the length of this post; but I hope it is a story that may inspire and embolden others in their journey through ill health. I, too, have a story worth sharing about my own brush with cancer that, again, with the strength and courage I found when fighting for my husband . may inspire as well. I shall save it for another day. In the meanwhile . I value and appreciate each and every comment and any interest anyone has had in this our story. You dissertation was so beautifully written that I just felt compelled to compliment it. The English philosopher Sor Francis Bacon once wrote that writing maketh an exact man. Soon, people will just be able to grunt and point at things; emojis are a definite move toward this. I was not yet married, but my mom did for me in essence what you did for yor husband. Thank you, my friend. Your story, also, inspires beyond measure. Your story, so filled with courage, endurance and love is one meant to share with others who may feel hope is lost through their own challenges. My mother always told me to follow my heart. Although she passed years ago, her strength and sweet nature is one of my inspirations to always listen to what you know is the direction to take, even though it may not be the easiest choice to make. I wish you nothing but continued good health and peace. And, I look forward to more exchanges with you to learn from your courage and determination. Your story is beyond imagination, please know that you are welcome here and that we are very supportIive of you and your dear husband and all you have been through. Please stay with us and keep us informed, we are very concerned and hoping for the best. Thank you for your interest, illead! I will be sure to share as we travel this uncertain journey. When able, I would be most interested in learning more about yours and how you managed it all.\n\n"

We evaluated the impact of nasal positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on the handicap index (HI) of golfers with OSAS. Golfers underwent a nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) to determine whether they had significant OSAS (respiratory disturbance index > 15). After 20 rounds of golf on PAP treatment, the HI was recalculated, and the questionnaires were repeated. Treatment of OSAS with PAP enhanced performance in golfers with this condition. Non-medical performance improvement may be a strong motivator for selected subjects with OSAS to seek treatment and maximize adherence. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of PAP treatment on the neurocognitive deficits associated with OSAS, ranging from significant benefits to no improvement.14–16 In these studies the severity of OSAS, the degree of cognitive impairment, the optimal length of PAP treatment, and the specific areas of cognitive improvement vary, making meaningful interpretation of the data difficult. The impact of OSAS and its treatment has been extensively investigated with regard to motor vehicle accidents, medical risks, and academic performance in children.2,3,9,17 Surprisingly, a relative paucity of data has been published regarding the impact of this condition on athletic and recreational performance. Golf is an internationally popular sport in which performance is largely dependent on physical and cognitive factors, including concentration, endurance, decision-making and mood control, along with hand-eye coordination and the athleticism of the participant.18 In this study we used the individual subjects' handicap index (HI) to measure changes in their golf performance. These questionnaires contained queries regarding medical and golf demographics, the ESS, a sleep questionnaire (SQ) developed by the authors to assess sleep-related quality-of-life in an online format, a golf questionnaire (GQ) developed by the authors to assess subjective assessment of golf performance, and a golf score template to allow score and other relevant data entry of the first 20 rounds played after treatment initiation. Participants from the OSAS group were titrated onto PAP per Sleep Lab protocol, and received all sleep care under the direct supervision of a board-certified sleep physician. After a total of 20 golf scores were submitted, subjects again completed the ESS, SQ, and GQ. In order to participate in this study, each individual was required to maintain a handicap with the Golf Handicap and Information Network (GHIN), which is a service of the USGA that calculates and maintains golfer handicaps. A number of factors are incorporated into the calculation: the actual number of strokes the golfer reports for each hole of each round that they play, the course rating, the slope rating, and other structured adjustments that are made to player scores that assure that the handicap index reflects playing skill regardless of the actual courses played during each round of golf. The course rating of each course played is a measure of golf course difficulty for scratch golfers, who are skilled golfers likely to score par on each hole played. We used an on-line handicap calculator to determine their HI at the end of their participation in the study, and we then confirmed that the HI was correct by rechecking their HI on the GHIN website after 20 scores had been submitted. Of that total, 24 participants met the criteria for participation in the OSAS group, and 12 of them completed both sets of questionnaires and submitted 20 consecutive golf scores. There were 17 subjects who met the criteria for participation in the control group, which included undergoing either an NPSG that did not demonstrate OSAS or a formal assessment by a board-certified sleep physician identifying him as being at very low risk for having OSAS. Twelve of those participants completed both sets of questionnaires and submitted 20 consecutive golf scores. All subjects who dropped out of this study cited the inconvenience of filling out the questionnaires or submitting the scores, or that they were not playing golf frequently enough to meet the 20-score criterion. Three of the 12 golfers in the control group and 2 of the 12 golfers in the OSAS group received golf lessons during their participation in this study. Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by each of the OSAS subjects (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 12). Comparison of initial and final handicap indexes across all subjects. Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by each of the OSAS subjects (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 12). Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by all golfers with an initial handicap index of 12 or less, both in the OSAS group (n = 5) and in the control group (n = 6). Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by all golfers with an initial handicap index of 12 or less, both in the OSAS group (n = 5) and in the control group (n = 6). Of the 12 subjects with OSAS, digital compliance reporting was obtained from 9 subjects. Improvements in the ESS and SQ in the OSAS group reconfirm that with successful treatment, patients enjoy substantial reductions in daytime somnolence. Our findings suggest that better golfers have maximized their golf skills, and that the drop in their HI concurrent with treatment of their OSAS was due to enhanced cognitive functioning. Successful treatment of OSAS, therefore, could lead to improved concentration and endurance, along with better decision making, all of which are likely to improve golf performance and lower the HI. Avid golfers often go to great lengths to lower their golf scores, often channeling vast amounts of time, money, and effort into those endeavors.18 Over the last ten years there has been a proliferation of programs available to enhance physical and/or psychological fitness as a means to improve golf performance. Less commonly are those efforts directed in ways that could improve their neurocognitive and motor skills. It is possible that the potential for improved golf performance may have served a motivational role in increasing treatment compliance. However, the 24 subjects who completed this study comprise a representative sampling of avid golfers (most commonly defined as middle-aged, male, playing 25 or more rounds of golf annually, with handicap indexes ranging between 4.9 and 21.4) in the United States. Because of this, we developed a simple 16-question survey (SQ) that can easily be filled out without assistance in an online format, and it contained many of the questions that we routinely ask when assessing response to PAP treatment in our patients. The answers to the SQ correlated with PAP response to a higher degree of statistical significance than the ESS did in this study, particularly in the low HI subjects. We developed a golf questionnaire in an effort to determine if there were specific aspects of playing golf that improved in the OSAS subjects with treatment. To our knowledge, there are currently no validated questionnaires that investigate the details of playing golf. Due to the small study size and the fact that all of the OSAS subjects exceeded compliance benchmarks, we were unable to include this control group in our data, and this represents another major factor that impacts the interpretation of the data derived from this study. Despite these limits, we believe our findings are relevant in the context of OSAS treatment and have strong clinical implications. The possibility of improving golf performance may have contributed to high rates of adherence with PAP therapy in this study. Dr. Benton contributed to the original idea for the study, subject recruitment, data collection and analysis, manuscript draft and editing. Golfer demographics show lots of green. 1997;8:9. Cases involving injury from errant golf balls, which are smaller than baseballs or hockey pucks but are likewise very hard and travel at high speeds, account for half of all reported golf-related tort actions. Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. In the 1970s and '80s, several cases involving injuries to spectators who paid to attend golf tournaments or other events reached appeals courts. One commentator suggests cases of this type, analogous to baseball, are much rarer in golf since professional players of that sport \"tend to be able to do what the average Joe cannot—consistently hit golf shots.\" Some of the situations that gave rise to the injuries argued similar reasons to Baseball Rule cases as to why golf courses or sponsoring organizations should be held liable.

The round ends when a player has six face-up cards (sometimes the other players are given one final turn following this), after which scoring happens as follows:  During play, it is not legal for a player to pick up a card from the discard pile and return it to the discard pile without playing it, to allow another player to retrieve the card. A card picked up from the discard pile must be swapped with one of the current player's cards. A full game is typically nine \"holes\" (hands), after the player with the lowest total score is designated the winner. A longer game can be played to eighteen holes. is considered a \"hole in 1\". If player does not obtain correct number of cards for a straight, then all points are added as usual. ; A player may \"shoot the moon\" by getting the maximum 60 points. He or she gets 0 points for the round, and all other players get 60 points. ; In \"Cutthroat Golf\" the kings are worth 15 points and if drawn from the deck can be traded for any other players up card. The card they receive must then be placed in their hand. There are many variants for point values of cards, including: In some versions, making a pair or triple of cards of equal rank (sometimes vertically, sometimes horizontally and sometimes diagonally) reduces those cards' scores to zero. This club played on a nine-hole course established at Montefiore Hill in modern-day Park 27 (Bonython Park / Tulya Wardli) of the Adelaide park lands. Cows, which had the run of the park lands at the time, were a frequent hazard on this early course. Fences were erected around the greens to prevent damage from grazing cattle, and local rules allowed golfers to take a mulligan if the fencing interfered with a shot. Players were also permitted to lift their ball from cow pats without incurring a penalty stroke.\n\nQuestion: In which sport may a 'Mulligan' be awarded?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of PAP treatment on the neurocognitive deficits associated with OSAS, ranging from significant benefits to no improvement.14–16 In these studies the severity of OSAS, the degree of cognitive impairment, the optimal length of PAP treatment, and the specific areas of cognitive improvement vary, making meaningful interpretation of the data difficult. The impact of OSAS and its treatment has been extensively investigated with regard to motor vehicle accidents, medical risks, and academic performance in children.2,3,9,17 Surprisingly, a relative paucity of data has been published regarding the impact of this condition on athletic and recreational performance. Golf is an internationally popular sport in which performance is largely dependent on physical and cognitive factors, including concentration, endurance, decision-making and mood control, along with hand-eye coordination and the athleticism of the participant.18 In this study we used the individual subjects' handicap index (HI) to measure changes in their golf performance. These questionnaires contained queries regarding medical and golf demographics, the ESS, a sleep questionnaire (SQ) developed by the authors to assess sleep-related quality-of-life in an online format, a golf questionnaire (GQ) developed by the authors to assess subjective assessment of golf performance, and a golf score template to allow score and other relevant data entry of the first 20 rounds played after treatment initiation. Participants from the OSAS group were titrated onto PAP per Sleep Lab protocol, and received all sleep care under the direct supervision of a board-certified sleep physician. After a total of 20 golf scores were submitted, subjects again completed the ESS, SQ, and GQ. In order to participate in this study, each individual was required to maintain a handicap with the Golf Handicap and Information Network (GHIN), which is a service of the USGA that calculates and maintains golfer handicaps. A number of factors are incorporated into the calculation: the actual number of strokes the golfer reports for each hole of each round that they play, the course rating, the slope rating, and other structured adjustments that are made to player scores that assure that the handicap index reflects playing skill regardless of the actual courses played during each round of golf. The course rating of each course played is a measure of golf course difficulty for scratch golfers, who are skilled golfers likely to score par on each hole played. We used an on-line handicap calculator to determine their HI at the end of their participation in the study, and we then confirmed that the HI was correct by rechecking their HI on the GHIN website after 20 scores had been submitted. Of that total, 24 participants met the criteria for participation in the OSAS group, and 12 of them completed both sets of questionnaires and submitted 20 consecutive golf scores. There were 17 subjects who met the criteria for participation in the control group, which included undergoing either an NPSG that did not demonstrate OSAS or a formal assessment by a board-certified sleep physician identifying him as being at very low risk for having OSAS. Twelve of those participants completed both sets of questionnaires and submitted 20 consecutive golf scores. All subjects who dropped out of this study cited the inconvenience of filling out the questionnaires or submitting the scores, or that they were not playing golf frequently enough to meet the 20-score criterion. Three of the 12 golfers in the control group and 2 of the 12 golfers in the OSAS group received golf lessons during their participation in this study. Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by each of the OSAS subjects (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 12). Comparison of initial and final handicap indexes across all subjects. Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by each of the OSAS subjects (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 12). Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by all golfers with an initial handicap index of 12 or less, both in the OSAS group (n = 5) and in the control group (n = 6). Bars represent handicap indexes as reported by all golfers with an initial handicap index of 12 or less, both in the OSAS group (n = 5) and in the control group (n = 6). Of the 12 subjects with OSAS, digital compliance reporting was obtained from 9 subjects. Improvements in the ESS and SQ in the OSAS group reconfirm that with successful treatment, patients enjoy substantial reductions in daytime somnolence. Our findings suggest that better golfers have maximized their golf skills, and that the drop in their HI concurrent with treatment of their OSAS was due to enhanced cognitive functioning. Successful treatment of OSAS, therefore, could lead to improved concentration and endurance, along with better decision making, all of which are likely to improve golf performance and lower the HI. Avid golfers often go to great lengths to lower their golf scores, often channeling vast amounts of time, money, and effort into those endeavors.18 Over the last ten years there has been a proliferation of programs available to enhance physical and/or psychological fitness as a means to improve golf performance. Less commonly are those efforts directed in ways that could improve their neurocognitive and motor skills. It is possible that the potential for improved golf performance may have served a motivational role in increasing treatment compliance. However, the 24 subjects who completed this study comprise a representative sampling of avid golfers (most commonly defined as middle-aged, male, playing 25 or more rounds of golf annually, with handicap indexes ranging between 4.9 and 21.4) in the United States. Because of this, we developed a simple 16-question survey (SQ) that can easily be filled out without assistance in an online format, and it contained many of the questions that we routinely ask when assessing response to PAP treatment in our patients. The answers to the SQ correlated with PAP response to a higher degree of statistical significance than the ESS did in this study, particularly in the low HI subjects. We developed a golf questionnaire in an effort to determine if there were specific aspects of playing golf that improved in the OSAS subjects with treatment. To our knowledge, there are currently no validated questionnaires that investigate the details of playing golf. Due to the small study size and the fact that all of the OSAS subjects exceeded compliance benchmarks, we were unable to include this control group in our data, and this represents another major factor that impacts the interpretation of the data derived from this study. Despite these limits, we believe our findings are relevant in the context of OSAS treatment and have strong clinical implications. The possibility of improving golf performance may have contributed to high rates of adherence with PAP therapy in this study. Dr. Benton contributed to the original idea for the study, subject recruitment, data collection and analysis, manuscript draft and editing. Golfer demographics show lots of green. 1997;8:9. Cases involving injury from errant golf balls, which are smaller than baseballs or hockey pucks but are likewise very hard and travel at high speeds, account for half of all reported golf-related tort actions. Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. In the 1970s and '80s, several cases involving injuries to spectators who paid to attend golf tournaments or other events reached appeals courts. One commentator suggests cases of this type, analogous to baseball, are much rarer in golf since professional players of that sport \"tend to be able to do what the average Joe cannot—consistently hit golf shots.\" Some of the situations that gave rise to the injuries argued similar reasons to Baseball Rule cases as to why golf courses or sponsoring organizations should be held liable. While waiting in line at a \n\n one of the face-down cards, the card swapped in remains face up. If the card drawn is discarded, the player can then either flip a card or choose to make no move. The round ends when a player has six face-up cards (sometimes the other players are given one final turn following this), after which scoring happens as follows:  During play, it is not legal for a player to pick up a card from the discard pile and return it to the discard pile without playing it, to allow another player to retrieve the card. A card picked up from the discard pile must be swapped with one of the current player's cards. A full game is typically nine \"holes\" (hands), after the player with the lowest total score is designated the winner. A longer game can be played to eighteen holes. is considered a \"hole in 1\". If player does not obtain correct number of cards for a straight, then all points are added as usual. ; A player may \"shoot the moon\" by getting the maximum 60 points. He or she gets 0 points for the round, and all other players get 60 points. ; In \"Cutthroat Golf\" the kings are worth 15 points and if drawn from the deck can be traded for any other players up card. The card they receive must then be placed in their hand. There are many variants for point values of cards, including: In some versions, making a pair or triple of cards of equal rank (sometimes vertically, sometimes horizontally and sometimes diagonally) reduces those cards' scores to zero. This club played on a nine-hole course established at Montefiore Hill in modern-day Park 27 (Bonython Park / Tulya Wardli) of the Adelaide park lands. Cows, which had the run of the park lands at the time, were a frequent hazard on this early course. Fences were erected around the greens to prevent damage from grazing cattle, and local rules allowed golfers to take a mulligan if the fencing interfered with a shot. Players were also permitted to lift their ball from cow pats without incurring a penalty stroke.\n\n"

On 4 March 2020, the first cases in Hungary were announced. As of June 2021, Hungary has the second-highest COVID-19 death rate in the world. Background \nAt the end of January 2020, a Hungarian operational task force was formed, which was led by Sándor Pintér, Interior Minister and Miklós Kásler, Minister of Human Resources, and included:\n Surgeon General Cecília Müller,\n Károly Papp, Director of Security Department of Interior Ministry,\n János Balogh, National Police Leader, and the directors of National High Directorate of Disaster Management, Anti-Terrorism Center, Central Hospital of South Pest, National Healthcare Supplying Service and National Ambulance. On 1 February, the spokesperson of National Command of Penalty Execution (BVOP) announced that prisoners of Debrecen and Sátoraljaújhely had started the production of sanitary masks. Due to the events and news connected to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, in February 2020, several goods—such as antiseptic arm cleaning materials, masks and non-perishable food – were in short supply in a lot of shops in Hungary. The Government of Hungary launched its official webpage and official Facebook page about the novel coronavirus, both on 4 March 2020. Timeline \n\nThe first two known cases were students from Iran, who were studying in Hungary. They arrived back in Hungary on 26 and 28 February 2020. He was a 69-year-old British man who was working in Milan and travelled frequently between Milan and Debrecen. He was diagnosed and transported to Gyula Kenézy Hospital. The son previously visited some other countries, such as Italy. The other was the Hungarian wife of the British man in Debrecen. A 99-year-old woman was in hospital, where she was operated on at Saint Imre Hospital. One was a student from Iran (a contact of the first case) whilst the other two were Hungarian citizens. One of the two Hungarians was a woman who had been in Saint Ladislaus Hospital for several days, the other one was a man travelling from Israel. On 13 March 2020, the number of known cases increased by 3, all of whom were Hungarian citizens. On the same day, Sándor Szaniszló, the Mayor of Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre announced the death of a patient at St Ladislaus Hospital who had been diagnosed with coronavirus. Graph charts\n\nInfections by county\n\nVaccination\n\nGovernment response \n\nOn 7 March 2020, national ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution on 15 March 2020 were cancelled. A job fair planned to be held between 18 and 19 March at the University of Technology and Economics was also postponed. The frequency of disinfection on Budapest public transport vehicles has increased, and the rule about using only the first door for boarding has been suspended, to decrease crowding. On 13 March 2020, similar rules regarding getting on public transport were introduced in Miskolc as well. Their capacity is now 81 rooms with 189 beds. Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden as well as every thermal bath will remain closed from 16 March. A consortium founded by Immunology Department at Faculty of Sciences of Eötvös Loránd University, Biological Institute at Science Faculty of University of Pécs, Richter Gedeon and ImmunoGenes is involved in international biotechnological developments. Some days after the successful isolation Bioinformatic Research Team of Szentágothay János Research Center at University of Pécs and the virologist experts of the university found the genome of new SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus available in Hungary. On 19 March, Andrea Bártfai-Mager Minister without portfolio, responsible for National Wealth and the team led by her prepared and accepted recommendations which were the basis of economic decisions published next day. Until the end of October, Orbán was against a lockdown which the country saw during the first wave. The curfew was extended to 8 p.m., gatherings were limited, stores and hairdressers had to close by 7 p.m., restaurants were only allowed to offer meals to go, hotels were not allowed to receive tourist guests, events and amateur team sport were banned, recreational facilities and institutions such as gyms, swimming pools, theatres, museums, and zoos were closed. A few days later it became mandatory to wear a face mask in all public spaces, except for green spaces, in large cities. On 21 May 2021, Orban informed that the nation was going to lift the most remaining COVID-19 restrictions, including a night-time curfew, as soon as the number of those vaccinated reaches 5 million. He also added that masks would no longer need to be worn in public, and gatherings of up to 500 people could be held in the open air. Events in closed spaces will be open to those with vaccination cards. Public gatherings in an enclosed space with more than 100 people were prohibited, sporting events that could attract more than 500 spectators must be held behind closed doors, and foreign exchange programs were suspended. On 13 March during a radio interview, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said kindergarten was also excluded since parents would have to guarantee children's supervision, and teachers would be required to take unpaid leave. On 16 March 2020, Prime Minister Orbán announced further restrictions, including ordering the cancellation of all events, and banning restaurants and cafes from operating beyond 3 pm. In addition, it was announced that the country would allow entry to Hungarian citizens only. Without mentioning Hungary, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen advised that measures for controlling the pandemic should be \"limited to what is necessary and strictly proportionate\", and \"not at the expense of our fundamental principles and values as set out in the treaties\". On 1 April 2020, a joint statement was issued by 13 EU member states, stating that they were \"deeply concerned\" about emergency initiatives violating democracy, fundamental rights, and the rule of law. On 30 April 2020, Viktor Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyás announced that Hungarian schools will remain closed to the end of May 2020, and events that feature more than 500 participants are banned until 15 August 2020. On 6 March 2020, Hungary suspended the issuance of visas to Iranian citizens. On 16 March 2020, Hungary restricted entry into the country to citizens only. From 27 April 2020, wearing a mask will be mandatory on public transport in Budapest. Economic decisions for managing the emergency \n\nMihály Varga Minister of Finance said the government had to react to the real needs of the economy, and they were still waiting for the feedback from the trade and industry chamber. On 18 March during the early afternooon hours Viktor Orbán announced several upcoming decisions. Short-term loans for companies are prolonged up to 30 June. Loans delivered from 19 March may have a maximum 5% above the Hungarian National Bank’s interest rate. Rental contracts which are in connection with the above listed sectors may not be abrogated, rental fees may not be increased. The Order about these changes was published in the 18 March edition of Magyar Közlöny. Mihály Varga Minister of Finance and representatives of Hungarian Banking Association had a meeting regarding actions listed above. Use of vaccines from China and Russia \nReports in March 2021 stated that Hungary was the first country in the EU to \"begin using China’s Sinopharm and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines, even as polling showed that public trust in non-EU approved vaccines was low\". The European Commission's Vaccine Passport plan excluded the Sputnik and Sinopharm products because they were not \"EU authorized vaccines\". In end March 2021, Hungary also granted emergency use licenses to two more vaccines, CanSino (from China) and Covishield (produced by Serum Institute of India), but as of August 2021, neither of them were used in the national vaccination programme.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. During that time, the band saturated the music charts and radio stations with songs such as “I’m a Believer,” “Daydream Believer,” “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Valleri,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone” and many others. The group consisted for Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, and the four had been assembled by producers at Screen Gems for the television show. However, the Monkees were eventually able to wrestle away more control of the recordings, and their musical careers continued after the television show ended. This episode of Documenting Popular Music, takes a look at the individual members of the Monkees and what they did after the break up – in the 1970s and 1980s. Velez, who has a wealth of knowledge about the group, also offers some behind the scenes history, including how the Monkees and the Beatles hung out together, and how Dolenz ended up using a Beatles song in an episode of the Monkees TV show. This episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at the tribute album and artist such as Garth Brooks, who performs “Phoenix” with Trisha Yearwood providing background vocals; the late Donna Sumer, who sings an inspiring version of “Nether Lands” using the same backing track that Fogelberg used for the 1977 classic; Amy Grant and Vince Gill, who provide a duet on “Longer” that gives new life to Fogelberg’s biggest hit; Randy Owen, the legendary voice of the group Alabama – the best-selling country group of all time – sings “Sutter’s Mill,” originally from Fogelberg’s progressive bluegrass album ‘High Country Snows;’ Zac Brown and his band deliver a live version of “Leader of the Band;” and Fogelberg’s good friend Joe Walsh of the Eagles sings “Part of the Plan,” a song he originally produced for Fogelberg for the 1974 album Souvenirs. Other artists on the album include Michael McDonald, Jimmy Buffett, Boz Scaggs, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band with Richie Furay, the late Dobie Gray, Train, Fool’s Gold (originally Fogelberg’s backing band) and Casey James. Putnam explains how Brooks and Summer got involved in the project, which is a true labor of love from Fogelberg’s widow, Jean Fogelberg, also a producer on the album. (Thank you Norbert) During our conversation, he told me about Garth Brooks’ and Donna Summer’s involvement with the tribute album; however, the lineup of stars on the album had not yet been released, and Jean asked that I not use the info for the show. I’m happy I could use Norbert’s recollections about Brooks and Summer for this review of the tribute album. In August 1963, \"I Can't Stay Mad at You\" was officially released as a single by RCA Victor, with the b-side being \"It Was Only a Heart\". As a country music artist, the song became Davis' twelfth top-twenty hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles, peaking at number fourteen. The record was an even bigger hit on the pop charts, becoming Davis' second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of number seven in 1963. 2 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks The song would become Davis' last single to enter the Billboard Pop top-forty, as her follow-up singles would reach progressively-lower positions on the chart in the later months and years. \"I Can't Stay Mad at You\" was later issued onto Davis' studio album Let Me Get Close to You in 1964. \"Time in a Bottle\" is a hit single by singer-songwriter Jim Croce. Croce wrote the lyrics after his wife Ingrid told him she was pregnant, in December 1970. It appeared on his 1972 ABC debut album You Don't Mess Around with Jim and was featured in the 1973 ABC made-for-television movie She Lives!

        "context": "Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career.

Her parents were from mainland China, and had traveled to Taiwan after their marriage. Nancy attended Taipei First Girls' High School in Taipei, where \"we were trained to compete with the boys\". They married just a few days before traveling to the United States, where both had received scholarships for graduate school: Nancy at Brown University and Tse Wen at Harvard University. Nancy subsequently changed her academic focus to biology and transferred to the Division of Medical Sciences, Harvard University. The Changs were among the first international students at the Division of Medical Sciences, and Nancy had to work extremely hard due to her unfamiliarity with English. Nancy earned her Ph.D. in biological chemistry from Harvard University. For a time, the Changs endured the difficulties of a commuter marriage: Nancy lived and worked in Parsippany, NY; Tse Wen commuted to Pennsylvania each week to work at Centocor. Nancy was instrumental in developing the first diagnostic assay to detect HIV infection by employing a peptide segment of HIV as the solid-phase antigen in the immunoassay. Both Nancy and Tse Wen suffered severely from allergies. Tse Wen continued his preferred work as a professor, and Nancy served as president of the new company. Nancy is an angel investor in health-care entrepreneurships and performs philanthropic work in community health-education projects. As of 2013, Nancy Chang was president of Apex Enterprises.

Rhythmic Entrainment Intervention (REI) is music-medicine program (Spintge and Droh 1992) that uses specific musical rhythms to stimulate and synchronize the listener’s brain. REI employs custom-made recordings that are developed for each client. The musical rhythms selected for a client’s recording are based upon an extensive intake process that uses variations on the standardized rating scales used to diagnose neurobiological conditions (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Connors’s Rating Scale, among others). Previous studies have shown that Rhythmic Entrainment Intervention (REI) provides positive gains for children with autism (Strong, 1993, Strong 1996, Strong 1998, Strong 2008, Strong 2014). Each subject’s custom-made REI recording was created based the REI Custom Program Intake and on their responses to my live performance. Jenn: Age 9; Female; Seizures, non-verbal, unresponsive, withdrawn. Carlos: Age 8; Male; Withdrawn and quiet, limited verbal. We all watched Steve as he visibly tensed. The screaming child stopped screaming after just a few minutes and Steve settled and everyone else in the room seemed to relax. Two minutes into these invigorating rhythms and Steve came over to the drum and tapped on it with me. We played together for a few minutes and I stopped. He kept on playing for about 30 seconds and then simply held onto the edge of the drum. Steve generally listened to his recording right after lunch, which was a tough time for him. Jenn was very passive and sat quietly during the entire 20 minutes that I played for her initial session. Jenn never really got anxious, so evaluating the calming effects was somewhat difficult. Her teachers did notice, however, that she seemed to focus better as the recording played, so they made a habit of playing it while they were working on tasks that she was often distracted from. Her teacher noted that Jenn “will sit by the player while listening to the REI recording. Nancy was quite a force. She entered the room singing a Disney movie song. She engaged with me to the extent that she sang and danced around me, so I just jumped in playing. ?no impact initially as she kept on singing and tried dancing with the psychologist. After about 3 minutes she abruptly stopped singing, turned to me with a serious look and put her hands on the edge of my drum. Nancy then began telling me how great I was and how awesome my drumming was. I tried to thank her and start playing again but she kept on, telling me just how amazing I truly was. This exaggerated praise lasted for several minutes until I decided to start playing again. Once I did, she began singing and dancing again until she tripped and fell into the recorder. I kept playing, lowering my volume and rhythmic intensity, as the psychologist held her. I played for another 12 minutes and stayed with low intensity, relatively simple rhythms to see if she would calm. She did. Nancy listened to her REI recording several times a day. I didn’t witness this the day I played for her, but Nancy had several aggressive incidents each day in school. The staff chose this time to put on her REI recording in the hopes that it would stop or at least reduce her aggressive behavior. She also said that whenever Nancy listened while in one on one care, she fell asleep to the recording. It wasn’t uncommon for Nancy to listen to her recording more than once a day. Kyle did, in fact, bounce around the room when I began playing but he settled down within abut three minutes. At about five minutes, Kyle sat down in a chair and chewed on a plastic toy. He giggled a few times as I played – mostly during the short, triplet-based, odd-rhythm patterns (rhythms in 15/16 or 17/16 time signatures). I played for for almost 20 minutes and at times got pretty loud, but Kyle never seemed to be bothered by my drumming. Overall, Kyle was calmed by his daily REI recording. Tomas stood in front of me as I played, often pushing my hands off the drum. He also vocalized the entire time and occasionally hit the drum. I found that slowing the rhythms down a bit (to about 6.5 beats per second) and avoiding the slap tones worked best. It was reported that Tomas was consistently calmed by his REI recording for the first two weeks, but became somewhat agitated by it during the third week. As it happens his recording was destroyed by another student after the third week. As this same Tomas began requesting to listen to another student’s REI recording. This one was calming for him for the rest of the study period. She seemed to like the drumming – there were a few occasions where she smiled as I played triplet-based rhythms. Like several other children in this study, she responded favorably to variations in a Brazilian Naningo rhythm. When I met with the staff at the four week point, her teacher reported that she “loves” her REI recording and often carried it around with her. According to the teacher notes, “Sandra loves listening to her recording. When Mark entered the room he came right up to me and started hitting the drum while talking and asking me questions. The psychologist attempted to redirect him after a couple of minutes, but Mark squirmed away and grabbed at my microphone. The psychologist caught his hand but Mark leaned in and started singing into it. Mark stood up, placed his hands on the drum and continued asking me questions and talking non-sensically. After a few minutes he moved from the drum and walked around the room while he continued talking. He remained sitting for the next ten minutes as I played. Based on his activity level as I played, he seemed to calm to very straight, structured rhythms. The most calming for him were variations on a Brazilian Samba rhythm. This 31-beat Samba was what I was playing when the psychologist was able to get Mark to sit down. His teacher started playing Mark’s REI recording first thing in the morning. Many days they also played his recording in the afternoon and it calmed him. She also noted that “Mark has been able to better express a variety of feelings as well as use quiet times to calm himself during anxiety. At our fist meeting, Carlos sat with a playing card in his hands, which he flexed rhythmically as I drummed. He occasionally looked at me and the faintest of smiles appeared whenever I played triplet-based rhythms. At one point, to test this theory, I slowed my rhythm and pounded out a steady pulse to see if he would join me. Interestingly, he also seemed to have a keen sense of my rhythms, which were complex by most musical standards, and flexed his card in syncopations to meet mine. Not the flexing of a card, but an apparent understanding of rhythmic complexity. I played for Carlos for a total of about twenty minutes. I asked if he liked the drumming and he said yes. According to his teacher and the tracking notes, the recording was consistently calming for Carlos. He often listened to his REI recording with headphones while doing schoolwork. I was playing quietly when Keanan entered the room. He immediately came over to me and put his hands on the side of the drum. Keanan giggled as the I hit the bass tones. After about 4 minutes of holding onto the drum and giggling as he felt the vibrations of the deeper tones, Keanan crawled under the drum. He positioned himself at my feet with his abdomen directly under the hole of the drum where the bass tones are most prominent and he stayed there as I played for another ten minutes. He clearly enjoyed this as he giggled and smiled during the more bass-tone heavy passages. Keanan, according to the tracking notes, was calmed 100% of the time that he listened to his recording. Because his recording was played within the larger classroom (he never had one-on-one aid outside the classroom), his teacher used his recording to not only calm him but to help create what she described as a “calmer classroom environment”. She reported that this not only helped calm Keenan and keep him from acting out toward others, but also that all the students present seemed to be less on edge while the recording played. I was only able to observe, and not play for, Lila the first time I met her. I created Lila’s REI recording based on the data I collected from playing for the other children. When I dropped off her recording I had the opportunity to play for her and to confirm the I had chosen the right rhythms for her. She didn’t react strongly one way or the other, but she did stop pulling on her hair after 6 minutes of my drumming. These rhythms were all in odd time signatures with individual beats added on or cut off, giving them an unpredictable feel. According to teacher reports and her tracking documents, Lila was calmed 100% of the time by her recording. This calming was also almost immediate, usually resulting in her stopping her stimming behavior within the first minute of the recording. The REI drumming proved to help with these emotional outbursts. Lila was especially calmed by her recording, resulting in a consistent cessation of her self-stimulatory hair pulling when the recording was played. For some it manifests as a reactivity born our of hyper-vigilanace, as demonstrated by Keanan, and for others it is an internal tension leaking out as a self-stimulatory behavior, as seen with Lila who constantly tugged on her hair.

Research on drumming has shown that it can both drive the brain and increase neurological activity (Shatin, et al, 1961). Stephanie’s mother called me because she had heard that I could calm children by playing a drum for them. Stephanie was diagnosed on the autism spectrum, with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified). As he played different rhythms the girl responded by becoming calm with one rhythm, animated and lively with another, and clearly agitated with yet another. This technique, he told me, had been around for hundreds of years and could be traced to to his ancestors in Nigeria. I got to know how even subtle changes in the rhythms, tempos, and orchestrations impacted listeners. Documenting each session, as well as her overall progress, was critical. So, aside from my drum, I had a portable DAT (digital audio tape) recorder, a cassette recorder, and an assistant who was present to document each moment of my performance and Stephanie’s responses. I asked Stephanie’s mother to sit with her and play quietly while I began drumming. I blended these rhythms together while slowly building the intensity with the tempo and volume. I also varied these rhythms by adding or dropping beats. After about twelve minutes I heard Stephanie’s sister say “Stephanie’s back”. I played for about eight more minutes before stopping. At the end she was noticeably calmer and was content staying in the room with her sister while her mother went to answer the phone. I met with Stephanie again two days later. However, when I began playing, Stephanie sat on the floor close to me and paged through a picture book. Stephanie’s mother left the room almost immediately upon my beginning to drum. She remained calm as I played and said goodbye as I left. This time when I arrived Stephanie met me at the door by herself and actually looked directly at me as I said hello. Her mother was on the phone and Stephanie and I (and the assistant) went to the living room and she helped set up my equipment. She placed the microphone on the stand and set it in front of my drum. Because she was calm to begin with, I didn’t really notice much change in her as I played. I played for a little over 20 minutes, using much more complex and stimulating rhythms than I played the first time we met. These were rhythms that sometimes became agitating for a listener, but Stephanie remained calm the entire time. Stephanie’s mother was off the phone by the time I stopped playing. I gave her the cassette of the session I just played and asked her to play it for Stephanie once a day for the next 8 weeks. These were major milestones for her. Stephanie was calmed almost immediately by the REI rhythms. These results, along with case studies conducted to date, suggest that children with autism can achieve positive gains by listening to REI drumming rhythms. I married many men, a ton of them, And yet I was untrue to none of them, Because I bumped off every one of them To keep my love alive. At night he was a horse's neck to me, So I performed an appendectomy To keep my love alive. I bought a little arsenic; he's sleeping now all right. Sir Roger played the harp; I cussed the thing.

Gradually, Bruscia guided Matt through the visions that emerged while they listened to tapes of classical music. In one session, Matt impulsively decided to let sunlight flood a dark cave and illuminate its contents. Matt revealed to Bruscia his history of alcohol and substance abuse, and confessed that, for years, he had felt more dead than alive. Matt underwent detoxification for several months and then joined a support group of alcoholics affected with HIV. He later told Bruscia, \"You really helped me to take a look at myself, and to begin embracing the life I still have to live.\" Greene knew that sometimes things get worse before they get better, but this particular Sunday she was alarmed that her right eye was starting to be affected as well as her left. She feared that soon she wouldn't be able to read at all.She recalled that the woman had prayed over each instrument and, as she played, seemed to go into a trance-like state.Greene had felt transformed.After the performance, she had bought the tape but hadn't yet played it.Now Greene decided to listen to the tape for the first time, hoping it would at least lift her depression.\n\nQuestion: who sings somethings gonna change my world\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Rhythmic Entrainment Intervention (REI) is clinically-proven and evidence-based custom-made auditory brain stimulation programs for individuals with neurological disorders. Rhythmic Entrainment Intervention (REI) is music-medicine program (Spintge and Droh 1992) that uses specific musical rhythms to stimulate and synchronize the listener’s brain. REI employs custom-made recordings that are developed for each client. The musical rhythms selected for a client’s recording are based upon an extensive intake process that uses variations on the standardized rating scales used to diagnose neurobiological conditions (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Connors’s Rating Scale, among others). Previous studies have shown that Rhythmic Entrainment Intervention (REI) provides positive gains for children with autism (Strong, 1993, Strong 1996, Strong 1998, Strong 2008, Strong 2014). Each subject’s custom-made REI recording was created based the REI Custom Program Intake and on their responses to my live performance. Jenn: Age 9; Female; Seizures, non-verbal, unresponsive, withdrawn. Carlos: Age 8; Male; Withdrawn and quiet, limited verbal. We all watched Steve as he visibly tensed. The screaming child stopped screaming after just a few minutes and Steve settled and everyone else in the room seemed to relax. Two minutes into these invigorating rhythms and Steve came over to the drum and tapped on it with me. We played together for a few minutes and I stopped. He kept on playing for about 30 seconds and then simply held onto the edge of the drum. Steve generally listened to his recording right after lunch, which was a tough time for him. Jenn was very passive and sat quietly during the entire 20 minutes that I played for her initial session. Jenn never really got anxious, so evaluating the calming effects was somewhat difficult. Her teachers did notice, however, that she seemed to focus better as the recording played, so they made a habit of playing it while they were working on tasks that she was often distracted from. Her teacher noted that Jenn “will sit by the player while listening to the REI recording. Nancy was quite a force. She entered the room singing a Disney movie song. She engaged with me to the extent that she sang and danced around me, so I just jumped in playing. ?no impact initially as she kept on singing and tried dancing with the psychologist. After about 3 minutes she abruptly stopped singing, turned to me with a serious look and put her hands on the edge of my drum. Nancy then began telling me how great I was and how awesome my drumming was. I tried to thank her and start playing again but she kept on, telling me just how amazing I truly was. This exaggerated praise lasted for several minutes until I decided to start playing again. Once I did, she began singing and dancing again until she tripped and fell into the recorder. I kept playing, lowering my volume and rhythmic intensity, as the psychologist held her. I played for another 12 minutes and stayed with low intensity, relatively simple rhythms to see if she would calm. She did. Nancy listened to her REI recording several times a day. I didn’t witness this the day I played for her, but Nancy had several aggressive incidents each day in school. The staff chose this time to put on her REI recording in the hopes that it would stop or at least reduce her aggressive behavior. She also said that whenever Nancy listened while in one on one care, she fell asleep to the recording. It wasn’t uncommon for Nancy to listen to her recording more than once a day. Kyle did, in fact, bounce around the room when I began playing but he settled down within abut three minutes. At about five minutes, Kyle sat down in a chair and chewed on a plastic toy. He giggled a few times as I played – mostly during the short, triplet-based, odd-rhythm patterns (rhythms in 15/16 or 17/16 time signatures). I played for for almost 20 minutes and at times got pretty loud, but Kyle never seemed to be bothered by my drumming. Overall, Kyle was calmed by his daily REI recording. Tomas stood in front of me as I played, often pushing my hands off the drum. He also vocalized the entire time and occasionally hit the drum. I found that slowing the rhythms down a bit (to about 6.5 beats per second) and avoiding the slap tones worked best. It was reported that Tomas was consistently calmed by his REI recording for the first two weeks, but became somewhat agitated by it during the third week. As it happens his recording was destroyed by another student after the third week. As this same Tomas began requesting to listen to another student’s REI recording. This one was calming for him for the rest of the study period. She seemed to like the drumming – there were a few occasions where she smiled as I played triplet-based rhythms. Like several other children in this study, she responded favorably to variations in a Brazilian Naningo rhythm. When I met with the staff at the four week point, her teacher reported that she “loves” her REI recording and often carried it around with her. According to the teacher notes, “Sandra loves listening to her recording. When Mark entered the room he came right up to me and started hitting the drum while talking and asking me questions. The psychologist attempted to redirect him after a couple of minutes, but Mark squirmed away and grabbed at my microphone. The psychologist caught his hand but Mark leaned in and started singing into it. Mark stood up, placed his hands on the drum and continued asking me questions and talking non-sensically. After a few minutes he moved from the drum and walked around the room while he continued talking. He remained sitting for the next ten minutes as I played. Based on his activity level as I played, he seemed to calm to very straight, structured rhythms. The most calming for him were variations on a Brazilian Samba rhythm. This 31-beat Samba was what I was playing when the psychologist was able to get Mark to sit down. His teacher started playing Mark’s REI recording first thing in the morning. Many days they also played his recording in the afternoon and it calmed him. She also noted that “Mark has been able to better express a variety of feelings as well as use quiet times to calm himself during anxiety. At our fist meeting, Carlos sat with a playing card in his hands, which he flexed rhythmically as I drummed. He occasionally looked at me and the faintest of smiles appeared whenever I played triplet-based rhythms. At one point, to test this theory, I slowed my rhythm and pounded out a steady pulse to see if he would join me. Interestingly, he also seemed to have a keen sense of my rhythms, which were complex by most musical standards, and flexed his card in syncopations to meet mine. Not the flexing of a card, but an apparent understanding of rhythmic complexity. I played for Carlos for a total of about twenty minutes. I asked if he liked the drumming and he said yes. According to his teacher and the tracking notes, the recording was consistently calming for Carlos. He often listened to his REI recording with headphones while doing schoolwork. I was playing quietly when Keanan entered the room. He immediately came over to me and put his hands on the side of the drum. Keanan giggled as the I hit the bass tones. After about 4 minutes of holding onto the drum and giggling as he felt the vibrations of the deeper tones, Keanan crawled under the drum. He positioned himself at my feet with his abdomen directly under the hole of the drum where the bass tones are most prominent and he stayed there as I played for another ten minutes. He clearly enjoyed this as he giggled and smiled during the more bass-tone heavy passages. Keanan, according to the tracking notes, was calmed 100% of the time that he listened to his recording. Because his recording was played within the larger classroom (he never had one-on-one aid outside the classroom), his teacher used his recording to not only calm him but to help create what she described as a “calmer classroom environment”. She reported that this not only helped calm Keenan and keep him from acting out toward others, but also that all the students present seemed to be less on edge while the recording played. I was only able to observe, and not play for, Lila the first time I met her. I created Lila’s REI recording based on the data I collected from playing for the other children. When I dropped off her recording I had the opportunity to play for her and to confirm the I had chosen the right rhythms for her. She didn’t react strongly one way or the other, but she did stop pulling on her hair after 6 minutes of my drumming. These rhythms were all in odd time signatures with individual beats added on or cut off, giving them an unpredictable feel. According to teacher reports and her tracking documents, Lila was calmed 100% of the time by her recording. This calming was also almost immediate, usually resulting in her stopping her stimming behavior within the first minute of the recording. The REI drumming proved to help with these emotional outbursts. Lila was especially calmed by her recording, resulting in a consistent cessation of her self-stimulatory hair pulling when the recording was played. For some it manifests as a reactivity born our of hyper-vigilanace, as demonstrated by Keanan, and for others it is an internal tension leaking out as a self-stimulatory behavior, as seen with Lila who constantly tugged on her hair.

Research on drumming has shown that it can both drive the brain and increase neurological activity (Shatin, et al, 1961). Stephanie’s mother called me because she had heard that I could calm children by playing a drum for them. Stephanie was diagnosed on the autism spectrum, with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified). As he played different rhythms the girl responded by becoming calm with one rhythm, animated and lively with another, and clearly agitated with yet another. This technique, he told me, had been around for hundreds of years and could be traced to to his ancestors in Nigeria. I got to know how even subtle changes in the rhythms, tempos, and orchestrations impacted listeners. Documenting each session, as well as her overall progress, was critical. So, aside from my drum, I had a portable DAT (digital audio tape) recorder, a cassette recorder, and an assistant who was present to document each moment of my performance and Stephanie’s responses. I asked Stephanie’s mother to sit with her and play quietly while I began drumming. I blended these rhythms together while slowly building the intensity with the tempo and volume. I also varied these rhythms by adding or dropping beats. After about twelve minutes I heard Stephanie’s sister say “Stephanie’s back”. I played for about eight more minutes before stopping. At the end she was noticeably calmer and was content staying in the room with her sister while her mother went to answer the phone. I met with Stephanie again two days later. However, when I began playing, Stephanie sat on the floor close to me and paged through a picture book. Stephanie’s mother left the room almost immediately upon my beginning to drum. She remained calm as I played and said goodbye as I left. This time when I arrived Stephanie met me at the door by herself and actually looked directly at me as I said hello. Her mother was on the phone and Stephanie and I (and the assistant) went to the living room and she helped set up my equipment. She placed the microphone on the stand and set it in front of my drum. Because she was calm to begin with, I didn’t really notice much change in her as I played. I played for a little over 20 minutes, using much more complex and stimulating rhythms than I played the first time we met. These were rhythms that sometimes became agitating for a listener, but Stephanie remained calm the entire time. Stephanie’s mother was off the phone by the time I stopped playing. I gave her the cassette of the session I just played and asked her to play it for Stephanie once a day for the next 8 weeks. These were major milestones for her. Stephanie was calmed almost immediately by the REI rhythms. These results, along with case studies conducted to date, suggest that children with autism can achieve positive gains by listening to REI drumming rhythms. I married many men, a ton of them, And yet I was untrue to none of them, Because I bumped off every one of them To keep my love alive. At night he was a horse's neck to me, So I performed an appendectomy To keep my love alive. I bought a little arsenic; he's sleeping now all right. Sir Roger played the harp; I cussed the thing. I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing, And now he plays where harps are just the thing, To keep my love alive, To keep my love alive! nothing much to go back to; he was passing through a rough phase in his marriage too.

Anaerobes instead use lower-energy, less-oxidizing substances such as nitrate (), fumarate (), sulfate (), or elemental sulfur (S). Fermentation, in contrast, does not use an electrochemical gradient but instead uses only substrate-level phosphorylation to produce ATP. These oxidized compounds are often formed during the fermentation pathway itself, but may also be external. There are two important anaerobic microbial methane formation pathways, through carbon dioxide / bicarbonate () reduction (respiration) or acetate fermentation. Ecological importance\n\nAnaerobic respiration is a critical component of the global nitrogen, iron, sulfur, and carbon cycles through the reduction of the oxyanions of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon to more-reduced compounds. The biogeochemical cycling of these compounds, which depends upon anaerobic respiration, significantly impacts the carbon cycle and global warming. Anaerobic respiration occurs in many environments, including freshwater and marine sediments, soil, subsurface aquifers, deep subsurface environments, and biofilms. Even environments, such as soil, that contain oxygen also have micro-environments that lack oxygen due to the slow diffusion characteristics of oxygen gas. An example of the ecological importance of anaerobic respiration is the use of nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, or dissimilatory denitrification, which is the main route by which fixed nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere as molecular nitrogen gas. Similar to mitochondria in oxygen-respiring microorganisms, some single-cellular anaerobic ciliates use denitrifying endosymbionts to gain energy. Another example is methanogenesis, a form of carbon-dioxide respiration, that is used to produce methane gas by anaerobic digestion. Biogenic methane is used as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. On the negative side, uncontrolled methanogenesis in landfill sites releases large volumes of methane into the atmosphere, where it acts as a powerful greenhouse gas. Specific types of anaerobic respiration are also critical in bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to convert toxic chemicals into less-harmful molecules to clean up contaminated beaches, aquifers, lakes, and oceans.

SPEAKER 2: Well, thank you so much for having me. SPEAKER 1: You described disorders as brain differences. We say this is a reflection of a disease that causes suffering and that is true. But we categorize it in very discrete boxes to the best of our ability. We all, to some degree, have differences. And it’s a matter of how different the difference, is if you will. SPEAKER 1: Give me an idea, for example. SPEAKER 2: For example, people with dyslexia may really struggle in school with reading and suffer as a result. There are very particular things that lend themselves to extraordinary strength. For example, I profile in the book a Dr. Beryl Benacerraf who is a physician with pretty severe dyslexia that really has caused her struggling. SPEAKER 1: And the same might be said for people with autism or people with bipolar? SPEAKER 2: Correct. SPEAKER 2: So yes. We all have better or not as good social relating abilities at times. But when it becomes more extreme and impairs functioning, that’s when we start to call it a quote “disorder”. You say it’s not a coincidence that many people with creative abilities also have these differences. SPEAKER 2: Yes, well it’s really fascinating. If you look back in time at the iconic geniuses of history, the Hemingway’s, the van Gogh’s, the Abraham Lincoln’s, the Albert Einsteins, you will have a hard time finding someone who did not have a mental illness or a learning disability. SPEAKER 2: You wouldn’t have any. And scientists don’t like to talk about striking in anecdotal things. And I agree with that. But the correlations are quite high. SPEAKER 3: Hi Ira, how are you? SPEAKER 1: Hi there. Go ahead. You know, what tools do you have to offer me, to offer my students to help them through that kind of thing? SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much for asking that question, something I really address in the book because the educational system is very uniform and children are expected to jump through every hoop. And as we’re talking about, some have weaknesses in certain areas but also what they don’t know is they have strengths, so their self-esteem suffers. As an educator, you may really be privy to that. But if you see that a child has an area of strength, you really want to fan that flame. You want to give them as much work in that arena so that they– and give them the feedback. SPEAKER 1: OK, Rene, thanks for calling. SPEAKER 3: Thank you so much. SPEAKER 1: You’re welcome. SPEAKER 4: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my call. SPEAKER 1: You’re welcome. Go ahead. SPEAKER 1: And why is that? SPEAKER 4: That’s really kind of helped me in my career. SPEAKER 1: Is that because you have dyslexia? But generally, I’ve kind of overcome it. But people think about learning disabilities, and in particular dyslexia, as a handicap. It’s excelled in my career as a mechanical engineer. It probably drifted my mind and my thoughts more towards math and science but it’s resulted in a very rewarding and helpful career. SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Chris. SPEAKER 2: It’s a common story. And it brings up an important point, which is you do want to treat people or help them develop the work arounds for the thing that is the relative weakness for them. So I don’t want to minimize the importance of that, that he was taught methods to cope with so that he could function in the world. And sometimes it still is a problem but for the most part he’s developed these work arounds. SPEAKER 1: That’s my question. SPEAKER 2: That’s the important thing. SPEAKER 1: I mean, if you give medication to people, do they not want it because they realize they’re more creative? And they’re right, by the way. That is the time they are highly creative and highly productive, they’re afraid to take medication because they think it will ruin that. And it’s more important to maintain a stable trajectory because no one stays hypomanic. And those two states, you cannot take your creativity and bring it to fruition. So it is important and it doesn’t rob you of the creativity. SPEAKER 2: I think that only slightly. And I agree with that. And I think that is important.

We say this is a reflection of a disease that causes suffering and that is true. But we categorize it in very discrete boxes to the best of our ability. We all, to some degree, have differences. And it’s a matter of how different the difference, is if you will. SPEAKER 1: Give me an idea, for example. SPEAKER 2: For example, people with dyslexia may really struggle in school with reading and suffer as a result. There are very particular things that lend themselves to extraordinary strength. For example, I profile in the book a Dr. Beryl Benacerraf who is a physician with pretty severe dyslexia that really has caused her struggling. SPEAKER 1: And the same might be said for people with autism or people with bipolar? SPEAKER 2: Correct. SPEAKER 2: So yes. We all have better or not as good social relating abilities at times. But when it becomes more extreme and impairs functioning, that’s when we start to call it a quote “disorder”. You say it’s not a coincidence that many people with creative abilities also have these differences. SPEAKER 2: Yes, well it’s really fascinating. If you look back in time at the iconic geniuses of history, the Hemingway’s, the van Gogh’s, the Abraham Lincoln’s, the Albert Einsteins, you will have a hard time finding someone who did not have a mental illness or a learning disability. SPEAKER 2: You wouldn’t have any. And scientists don’t like to talk about striking in anecdotal things. And I agree with that. But the correlations are quite high. SPEAKER 3: Hi Ira, how are you? SPEAKER 1: Hi there. Go ahead. You know, what tools do you have to offer me, to offer my students to help them through that kind of thing? SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much for asking that question, something I really address in the book because the educational system is very uniform and children are expected to jump through every hoop. And as we’re talking about, some have weaknesses in certain areas but also what they don’t know is they have strengths, so their self-esteem suffers. As an educator, you may really be privy to that. But if you see that a child has an area of strength, you really want to fan that flame. You want to give them as much work in that arena so that they– and give them the feedback. SPEAKER 1: OK, Rene, thanks for calling. SPEAKER 3: Thank you so much. SPEAKER 1: You’re welcome. SPEAKER 4: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my call. SPEAKER 1: You’re welcome. Go ahead. SPEAKER 1: And why is that? SPEAKER 4: That’s really kind of helped me in my career. SPEAKER 1: Is that because you have dyslexia? But generally, I’ve kind of overcome it. But people think about learning disabilities, and in particular dyslexia, as a handicap. It’s excelled in my career as a mechanical engineer. It probably drifted my mind and my thoughts more towards math and science but it’s resulted in a very rewarding and helpful career. SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Chris. SPEAKER 2: It’s a common story. And it brings up an important point, which is you do want to treat people or help them develop the work arounds for the thing that is the relative weakness for them. So I don’t want to minimize the importance of that, that he was taught methods to cope with so that he could function in the world. And sometimes it still is a problem but for the most part he’s developed these work arounds. SPEAKER 1: That’s my question. SPEAKER 2: That’s the important thing. SPEAKER 1: I mean, if you give medication to people, do they not want it because they realize they’re more creative? And they’re right, by the way. That is the time they are highly creative and highly productive, they’re afraid to take medication because they think it will ruin that. And it’s more important to maintain a stable trajectory because no one stays hypomanic. And those two states, you cannot take your creativity and bring it to fruition. So it is important and it doesn’t rob you of the creativity. SPEAKER 2: I think that only slightly. And I agree with that. And I think that is important. That will help that person to find vocation, to find pleasure, to find self-esteem because it’s very hard when someone comes in for treatment to help them with the portion of this that is about feeling abnormal or bad. SPEAKER 1: First time, long time. Go ahead. SPEAKER 5: My question for Gail is– well, let me start let me start over.

The popularity of the Indian curry in the UK was mainly made by South Indians, Bangladeshi, and Punjabi restaurateurs, where 85 percent of Indian restaurants in the UK are in fact \n\n Cranks has been seen as a major factor in the spread of vegetarianism in recent decades. The Financial Times reported \"Cranks restaurants and recipes popularised vegetarian food on the high street and in the home.\" United States journalist Avery Yale Kamila of the Portland Press Herald reported Cranks is \"credited with setting the tone for London’s current vibrant veg scene.\" Broadbent started vegetarian eating establishments in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Leicester, with the intention of bettering the social position of women, by providing them the opportunity to earn a living wage. The meals were also provided at a low price, so that poorer people would be able to access vegetarian meals; this enterprise ended in failure and, as result, Broadbent suffered a significant financial loss. After experiencing a complete nervous breakdown, Broadbent died on 21 January 1912.\n\n support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices. Subway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab. On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.\n\n"

Vascular resistance\n Pulmonary shunt\n\nHistory\n\nPulmonary circulation is archaically known as \"lesser circulation.\" In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 - 1657 CE) based on the comprehensive completeness and correctness of his model, despite its relative recency. Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation: Hippocrates for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole and al-Nafis for making great strides over the understanding of those before him and towards a rigorous model. Primitive descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found throughout several ancient cultures. The next addition to the historical understanding of pulmonary circulation arrived with the Ancient Greeks. Physician Alcmaeon (520 - 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for all of the vessels in the body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized by pulmonary respiration. Hippocrates was the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system, separable from systemic circulation, in his Corpus Hippocraticum, which is often regarded as the foundational text of modern medicine. Hippocrates developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, and that this traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it. He described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum, and depicted the heart as the nexus point of all of the vessels of the body. Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. Greek physician Erasistratus (315 - 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. The Greek physician Galen (129 - c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were marginally or completely incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community's understanding for hundreds of years after his death. Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation: air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits that could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen further proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors that were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role to the left: it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum. In it, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen. The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon in 1242 in which he provided possibly the first known description of the system that remains substantially congruent with modern understandings, in spite of its flaws. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed allowed blood to flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he surmised that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was a system like pulmonary circulation. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al-Nafis still believed in the quasi-mythical concept of vital spirit and that it was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. In 2021, several researchers described a text predating the work of al-Nafis, fargh- beyn-roh va nafs, in which there is a comparable report on pulmonary circulation. It took centuries for other scientists and physicians to reach conclusions that were similar to and then more accurate than those of al-Nafis and ibn Luqa. The Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 - 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen's view of circulatory anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book De humani corporis fabrica libri septem in 1543. Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 - 1559 CE) published a book, De re anatomica libri XV, in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation. Finally, in 1628, the influential British physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 AD) provided at the time the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any scholar worldwide in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus.

He described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum, and depicted the heart as the nexus point of all of the vessels of the body. Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. Greek physician Erasistratus (315 - 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. The Greek physician Galen (129 - c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were marginally or completely incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community's understanding for hundreds of years after his death. Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation: air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits that could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen further proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors that were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role to the left: it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum. In it, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen. The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon in 1242 in which he provided possibly the first known description of the system that remains substantially congruent with modern understandings, in spite of its flaws. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed allowed blood to flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he surmised that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was a system like pulmonary circulation. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al-Nafis still believed in the quasi-mythical concept of vital spirit and that it was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. In 2021, several researchers described a text predating the work of al-Nafis, fargh- beyn-roh va nafs, in which there is a comparable report on pulmonary circulation. It took centuries for other scientists and physicians to reach conclusions that were similar to and then more accurate than those of al-Nafis and ibn Luqa. The Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 - 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen's view of circulatory anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book De humani corporis fabrica libri septem in 1543. Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 - 1559 CE) published a book, De re anatomica libri XV, in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation. Finally, in 1628, the influential British physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 AD) provided at the time the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any scholar worldwide in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus. At the macroscopic level, his model is still recognizable in and reconcilable with modern understandings of pulmonary circulation.

In the 1980s, a psychiatrist and researcher named Norman Rosenthal identified this pattern as a type of depressive disorder called Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as SAD. He developed a test called the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), which is free and available to the public. These are symptoms that go far beyond a mild post-holiday deflation. The strongest association, however, is with the supply of daylight hours. In the northern hemisphere, the shortest day of the year is Dec. 21, and days slowly lengthen through January and February. The connection between SAD and daylight also explains why a subset of people with SAD have a pattern of seasonal mood change during the later spring and summer. If lack of daylight is the problem, then the solution appears simple: Increase exposure to light. Typical indoor lighting is not strong enough to raise mood. They are typically used early in the day for increments that can range from 20 to 90 minutes. In Scandinavia, there are even light rooms. While devices such as lightboxes are available without a prescription, there are important reasons to consult your physician before exploring this method. - Wake up at dawn in order to maximize your exposure to natural light. - Take a morning walk since light early in the day maintains your circadian rhythm. - If you live in an apartment with little exposure to light, consider relocating to one with significant exposure to natural light. - If you are a homeowner, spend the bulk of your time in the most sun-lit room. - At work, move your desk or workstation next to a window for maximal access to light. - Spend winter vacation times in sunny destinations. - Start exercising before seasonal mood shifts are likely. - Plan the activities into your calendar and treat them like other appointments. - Plan to meet a friend for exercise for the social, as well as physical, benefits. - Resisting the impulse to sleep in on weekends. - Avoiding the snooze button on your alarm clock because it rewards later and later rising times.

Dr.Stickler is a future-focused visionary and a thought leader in human potential. He is the cof ounder of the Apeiron Center for Human Potential and the Apeiron Academy. Disheartened by our current “sick care” approach to health, Dr. Stickler created Human Potential Medicine- an integrated, biospherical systems-approach that combines the scientific grounding and expertise of modern medicine with leading-edge genetic/epigenetic science and neuro-psychophysiological modalities to expand human capacity. He also established the Apeiron Academy, which offers advanced education to a tribe of like-minded individuals determined to shift the health & wellness paradigm from the current sick-care model to one of optimized human potential. Striving for the best possible outcomes, he created a highly successful whole systems approach in collaboration with a skilled team of dietitians, health psychologists, and exercise physiologists. The quest to discover the ideal approach to optimizing human potential took him on a path through functional medicine, alternative care, holistic approaches, naturopathic, and age-management medicine. Continuing to search, an obsession with genetics and epigenetics was birthed. Finally, he has found the answer to precision programming for an optimized life: the DNA code, the blueprint design of all of life. This discovery has led to the clear knowing that we truly have the ability to architect our evolution. Dr. Stickler’s leadership informing Neurohacker Collective’s approach to the science of human optimization, will deliver some of the most well researched and scientifically rigorous products available in the wellness market for years to come.\n\nQuestion: Who was the author of the book \"The Coming Global Superstorm\" and was also the host of the radio program \"Coast to Coast AM?\" \nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His work has been viewed by millions on PBS, the Discovery Channel, the Today Show, and in over 500 media interviews. He is currently working on a book on anti-aging. Gavin A. Cloherty, Ph.D. is Director of Infectious Disease Research, R&D for Abbott’s diagnostics business. As one of the top experts in the field, Dr. Gavin Cloherty’s innovative research is changing the way infectious diseases are being diagnosed. His expertise is sought after globally through his established partnerships with commercial organizations, ministries of health and government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Bill Rawls graduated from Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in 1985. He holds a medical license in North Carolina. After practicing obstetrics and gynecology for fifteen years, Dr. Rawls life was changed forever by a confrontation with fibromyalgia and Lyme disease. After successfully restoring his own health, he set about to help others do the same. Recognizing the profound limitations of conventional medicine for treating chronic conditions such as chronic Lyme disease and fibromyalgia, he devoted his life to finding a better way. Beyond clinical work, Dr. Rawls has written extensively on health topics, including Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, chronic immune dysfunction, and other health and wellness topics. His latest book, Unlocking Lyme, puts all the pieces together for fibromyalgia and Lyme disease sufferers and offers a reasonable and safe pathway back to normal health. Dr.Stickler is a future-focused visionary and a thought leader in human potential. He is the cof ounder of the Apeiron Center for Human Potential and the Apeiron Academy. Disheartened by our current “sick care” approach to health, Dr. Stickler created Human Potential Medicine- an integrated, biospherical systems-approach that combines the scientific grounding and expertise of modern medicine with leading-edge genetic/epigenetic science and neuro-psychophysiological modalities to expand human capacity. He also established the Apeiron Academy, which offers advanced education to a tribe of like-minded individuals determined to shift the health & wellness paradigm from the current sick-care model to one of optimized human potential. Striving for the best possible outcomes, he created a highly successful whole systems approach in collaboration with a skilled team of dietitians, health psychologists, and exercise physiologists. The quest to discover the ideal approach to optimizing human potential took him on a path through functional medicine, alternative care, holistic approaches, naturopathic, and age-management medicine. Continuing to search, an obsession with genetics and epigenetics was birthed. Finally, he has found the answer to precision programming for an optimized life: the DNA code, the blueprint design of all of life. This discovery has led to the clear knowing that we truly have the ability to architect our evolution. Dr. Stickler’s leadership informing Neurohacker Collective’s approach to the science of human optimization, will deliver some of the most well researched and scientifically rigorous products available in the wellness market for years to come.\n\n"

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident. Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. Will Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast. Music\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Release\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games. Concussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment. Critical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized. Accolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. After comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue. The New York Times discovered emails directly referencing removing \"unflattering moments for the NFL” and removing “most of the bite” out of the film “for legal reasons with the NFL\". Landesman stated the changes were made \"to portray the characters and story as accurately as possible to reduce the chance that the league could attack the filmmakers for taking too much creative license\". The film received positive reviews from critics who praised Crowe's and Connelly's performances. The film went on to receive eight Academy Award nominations including a win for Best Picture and a nomination and win for Howard as Best Director. In 2005, Howard directed the biographical sports drama Cinderella Man based on the true story of heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock played by Russell Crowe. The film also starred Renée Zellweger as his wife Mae Braddock, and Paul Giamatti as his trainer Joe Gould. Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 214 critics with \n\n of real life.\" Joe Leyden of Variety called the film \"a warmed-over 'Bonnie and Clyde' for the social media era\" and wrote: \"One can always make the argument that it's not absolutely necessary to have sympathetic protagonists for a drama to enthrall or enlighten.

On 7 July 2013 he became the first British player to win the men's singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, 77 years before. Brother Jamie and won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title along with Serbian Jelena Janković in 2007, the first time any British player had won a major title at Wimbledon in 20 years. Colin Fleming along with his English partner Ross Hutchins is currently ranked 9th in the ATP Doubles Team Rankings.\n\n"

The only brand new song from Kristofferson's pen on the LP was the Caribbean-tinged ballad \"Prove It to You One More Time Again\", which was released as a single and barely scraped the lower reaches of the country singles chart. Soon-to-be ex-wife Rita Coolidge provides background vocals on the album and also received a co-writing credit for \"Fallen Angel\". Bill Porter engineered the song for the Elvis Presley recording session on May 26, 1963, at RCA Studios in Nashville. \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\" and its flipside, \"Please Don't Drag That String Around\", was recorded for a full-length album that was scheduled for release in 1963, but RCA chose instead to release the album piecemeal on singles and as soundtrack album bonus tracks. Bass singer Ray Walker, of the gospel vocal group The Jordanaires (who also worked as Presley's backing vocalists for much of his career), is featured in the song, singing the repeated phrase in a deep voice, in order to represent the devil: \"Oh, yes, you are,\" before the song's fade. After seeing the condition that Randall was in at the time, his manager told him, \"Hey man, every now and then you've got to put a bottle to your head and pull the trigger.\" He then met Bill Anderson and began to write the song, which eventually made its way to Paisley. When Paisley originally discovered the song, he had told Anderson that he would like to record it with either Alison Krauss or Dolly Parton; Anderson agreed to either singer (for he is a fan of both), and the song would then be recorded by Paisley and Krauss. \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\" is a 1963 single by Elvis Presley which was written by Bill Giant, Bernie Baum and Florence Kaye. In 1963, when the song was debuted to a British audience on the BBC television show Juke Box Jury, celebrity guest John Lennon voted the song \"a miss\" stating on the new song that Elvis Presley was \"like Bing \n\n and this idea was reinforced by the fact that Shake Hands with the Devil consisted mostly of songs from his past, such as the title track, which was an unheard 1970 copyright, as well as \"Come Sundown\", which hit the Top 10 for Bobby Bare in 1970 (and would also be recorded twice by George Jones) and \"Once More with Feeling,\" which was a Top 5 country smash for Jerry Lee Lewis the same year.

Shifts in national military strategy have emphasized an \"evacuate and replace\" philosophy regarding the treatment and transportation of ill and injured personnel. This strategy has led to a significant reduction in the Air Force's forward, in- theater medical footprint, requiring the development of a robust patient movement capability. AE is now tasked to rapidly evacuate casualties from numerous, forward locations that are supported by small expeditionary medical units. This has created the need to shift from evacuating \"stable\" patients to evacuating \"stabilized\" patients, and developing the capability to care for critically ill and injured personnel during air transport. The single, key element in the success of this shift in our concept of operations is the capability of the Critical Care Air Transport Team. This positioning has ensured vital critical care is within minutes of those who need it. They have also provided essential critical care in conjunction with Special Operations Forces - Medical Elements (SOF-ME) on-board SOF aircraft conducting evacuation of critically ill or injured patients. To date, the CCATTs have cared for more than 4000 patients on life-support ventilation with a perfect record of no patient complications while in-flight. As such, AMC is responsible for providing daily oversight, management, and coordination of all CCATT activities and issues across the Air Force including administrative support, logistical support, training requirements, aeromedical support, clinical matters, equipment funding and development, etc. On a day-to-day basis, CCATTs are assigned to and work as clinical staff members in fixed medical treatment facilities, but are available for critical care air transport missions on an occasional basis. When called upon, they participate in flying activities on military aircraft performing essential, specific, medical care duties in flight as their primary mission. CCATT equipment and supplies are designed to supplement what the AE system already carries. Their equipment sets are man-portable and contain everything they need to create an ICU on an aircraft. The course teaches and tests operational concepts, flight and altitude physiology, and critical care knowledge as it applies to air and ground transport of the critically ill or injured patient. There are also extensive didactics on the air-evac system as well as the physiology of transporting critically ill patients by air. The course culminates in field exercises involving static clinical simulator training as well as a flight “check ride.” Over the past decade, the Critical Care Air Transport Team has matured to become a true force-enhancement; giving war-fighters the confidence they will receive prompt evacuation and emergent medical care should the need arise. Although the term \"flight surgery\" is considered improper by purists, it may occasionally be encountered. In the United States Department of Defense, the Army, Navy, and Air Force all train and utilize flight surgeons. In the U.S military, flight surgeons are trained to fill general public health and occupational and preventive medicine roles, and are only infrequently \"surgeons\" in an operating theater sense. They may be called upon to provide medical consultation as members of an investigation board into a military or NASA aviation or spaceflight mishap. Occasionally, they may serve to provide in-flight care to patients being evacuated via aeromedical evacuation, either fixed wing or rotary wing. Some civilian AMEs have training similar to that of military flight surgeons, and some are either retired military flight surgeons or actively serving flight surgeons in a military Reserve Component. The original intent was for the military and the Surgeon General to understand what was causing the high flight mishap rate. Cold War\n\nFlight Surgeons were still utilized but only in Garrison environments. Today\n\nTraining\nThe position of flight surgeon requires additional specialized training beyond traditional medical school, training which is both military and medical in nature. For example, some routine treatments, such as certain antihistamines, when administered to aviation personnel, are cause for temporary grounding (loss of flying privileges) until the therapy and its effects are completed. Further, the whole \"mindset\" of aviation medicine practitioners is different from that of non-aviation physicians.

Some Air Force Flight Surgeons ultimately move on to the Residency in Aerospace Medicine (RAM), a three-year program involving a Master of Public Health, a year of aerospace medical training, and a year of either occupational or preventive medical training. Graduates of the RAM are eligible to be double-boarded in Aerospace Medicine and either Occupational or Preventive Medicine, and are generally assigned to supervise other flight surgeons or medical units. The RAM also involves Medical Officer Flight Familiarization Training (MOFFT), during which the flight surgeon receives abbreviated ground school and some basic pilot training in the T-6 Texan II. Consequently, a RAM has some actual piloting experience and some training toward initial qualification, although the aeronautical rating of USAF Pilot is not awarded. A limited number of USAF Flight Surgeons may also perform duties as Pilot-Physicians (Air Force Specialty Code 48VX).

Consequently, a RAM has some actual piloting experience and some training toward initial qualification, although the aeronautical rating of USAF Pilot is not awarded. A limited number of USAF Flight Surgeons may also perform duties as Pilot-Physicians (Air Force Specialty Code 48VX). Pilot-physicians were previously assigned only to an operational flying squadron in their respective aircraft, with their main assignment as a pilot, but also with clinical duties seeing patients, usually the aviation medicine clinic, depending on the pilot-physician's medical specialty. Air Force Flight Surgeon insignia\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nIn the U.S. Navy, initial flight surgeon training is conducted via the Flight Surgeon Primary Course at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Naval Flight Surgeons may also attend a three-year RAM training program that is distinct from the USAF program. More senior flight surgeons will later be assigned to the staffs of a Naval Air Force or Marine Aircraft Wing, carrier air wings, functional/type air wings, Marine Aircraft Groups, the Medical Departments of aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships, or the staffs of Naval Hospitals or Naval Branch Clinics aboard Naval Air Stations, Marine Corps Air Stations and Naval Air Facilities.

In the past, most Army RAMs have participated in the USAF program, but many take part in the USN program, while a few study in the only US civilian RAM program, located at Wright State University. Like their USAF counterparts, Army flight surgeons also hold three different rating levels, Flight Surgeon, Senior Flight Surgeon and Master Flight Surgeon, contingent upon years of service as a flight surgeon and total flight hours logged. Army flight surgeons support all active duty Army Aviation units and personnel, as well as those in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. Army Flight Surgeon insignia\n\nOther countries\nThe training requirements for military flight surgeons in countries other than the United States are different—for example, in the United Kingdom, Aviation Medicine is considered a sub-specialty of Occupational Medicine rather than a fully separate specialty.

        "context": "It is a limited, rapidly deployable resource and a primary component of the Air Force's Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) System. Shifts in national military strategy have emphasized an \"evacuate and replace\" philosophy regarding the treatment and transportation of ill and injured personnel. This strategy has led to a significant reduction in the Air Force's forward, in- theater medical footprint, requiring the development of a robust patient movement capability. AE is now tasked to rapidly evacuate casualties from numerous, forward locations that are supported by small expeditionary medical units. This has created the need to shift from evacuating \"stable\" patients to evacuating \"stabilized\" patients, and developing the capability to care for critically ill and injured personnel during air transport. The single, key element in the success of this shift in our concept of operations is the capability of the Critical Care Air Transport Team. This positioning has ensured vital critical care is within minutes of those who need it. They have also provided essential critical care in conjunction with Special Operations Forces - Medical Elements (SOF-ME) on-board SOF aircraft conducting evacuation of critically ill or injured patients. To date, the CCATTs have cared for more than 4000 patients on life-support ventilation with a perfect record of no patient complications while in-flight. As such, AMC is responsible for providing daily oversight, management, and coordination of all CCATT activities and issues across the Air Force including administrative support, logistical support, training requirements, aeromedical support, clinical matters, equipment funding and development, etc. On a day-to-day basis, CCATTs are assigned to and work as clinical staff members in fixed medical treatment facilities, but are available for critical care air transport missions on an occasional basis. When called upon, they participate in flying activities on military aircraft performing essential, specific, medical care duties in flight as their primary mission. CCATT equipment and supplies are designed to supplement what the AE system already carries. Their equipment sets are man-portable and contain everything they need to create an ICU on an aircraft. The course teaches and tests operational concepts, flight and altitude physiology, and critical care knowledge as it applies to air and ground transport of the critically ill or injured patient. There are also extensive didactics on the air-evac system as well as the physiology of transporting critically ill patients by air. The course culminates in field exercises involving static clinical simulator training as well as a flight “check ride.” Over the past decade, the Critical Care Air Transport Team has matured to become a true force-enhancement; giving war-fighters the confidence they will receive prompt evacuation and emergent medical care should the need arise. Although the term \"flight surgery\" is considered improper by purists, it may occasionally be encountered. In the United States Department of Defense, the Army, Navy, and Air Force all train and utilize flight surgeons. In the U.S military, flight surgeons are trained to fill general public health and occupational and preventive medicine roles, and are only infrequently \"surgeons\" in an operating theater sense. They may be called upon to provide medical consultation as members of an investigation board into a military or NASA aviation or spaceflight mishap. Occasionally, they may serve to provide in-flight care to patients being evacuated via aeromedical evacuation, either fixed wing or rotary wing. Some civilian AMEs have training similar to that of military flight surgeons, and some are either retired military flight surgeons or actively serving flight surgeons in a military Reserve Component. The original intent was for the military and the Surgeon General to understand what was causing the high flight mishap rate. Cold War\n\nFlight Surgeons were still utilized but only in Garrison environments. Today\n\nTraining\nThe position of flight surgeon requires additional specialized training beyond traditional medical school, training which is both military and medical in nature. For example, some routine treatments, such as certain antihistamines, when administered to aviation personnel, are cause for temporary grounding (loss of flying privileges) until the therapy and its effects are completed. Further, the whole \"mindset\" of aviation medicine practitioners is different from that of non-aviation physicians. Most medical problems on the ground are \"an abnormal response to a normal environment\", while in aviation the clinician must consider the \"normal response to an abnormal environment.\" Flight surgeon training varies depending on the branch of military service:\n\nU.S. Air Force\n\nIn the U.S. Air Force, most flight surgeons receive initial training at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The entry curriculum is known as the Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) Course, a two-week curriculum that involves aeromedical topics as well as aircrew and survival training.

By May 2011, 48 Growlers had been delivered to the U.S. Navy. With the termination of the EB-52H standoff jammer, the Growler became the sole remaining manned tactical jammer. Air Staff requirements director Maj. Gen. David Scott has indicated that the USAF will seek to provide electronic warfare officers to fly on U.S. Navy Growlers, without providing funding to purchase additional aircraft. U.S. Air Force personnel of 390th Electronic Combat Squadron stationed at NAS Whidbey Island have been supporting and flying the Growler. The EA-18G was first used in combat during Operation Odyssey Dawn, enforcing the UN no-fly zone over Libya in 2011. Five EA-18Gs were redeployed from Iraq to support operations in Libya in 2011.
