Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. The book remains available on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats. Monolopolus told Holmes that \"Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people \"...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible.\" Since the release of the book and documentary, Faulkner has spoken publicly on the topics of TBI, rehabilitation, motivation and recovery. Later in 2019, Faulkner participated in a video feature in support of Mercy Flight, describing his accident, the EMS support, his recovery and motivations. The video was featured at the 2019 \"Beacon of Hope Gala\" to raise money for their causes. In December 2020, Faulkner was recorded for two videos for the Brainwaves Video Anthology channel on YouTube. In the videos, Faulkner shared his story, and how he hopes to have an impact on the lives of others, just as so many others helped him.

Release \nOn March 23, 2013, the book was released with the documentary film, Recovery (2016), at the film's \"grand Buffalo screening\" which took place at University at Buffalo (UB) Center for the Arts[4]. The documentary film, which also documents Faulkner's accident, TBI and life after, was first test screened in Buffalo, New York in 2013, applied to film festivals in 2014, premiered at a film festival in 2015, and became publicly available in 2016. Additionally, the film has streamed for free on FilmFreeway since September 7, 2017. Recovery was directed and produced by Ryan Monolopolus, who also graduated from WSW alongside Faulkner and remained friends with him following high school. Monolopolus was interviewed by the West Seneca Central School District for their Spring 2017 newsletter, and indicated that the film's debut screening at UB was \"the largest screening for a student work ever at UB.\" According to Monolopolus' resume, the film was allegedly selected as the \"Best Documentary\" at the \"Speak Here, First\" film festival in 2015, although no other reference to this can be found.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Included on the album is the now classic “Angels of Fenway,” a tribute to the Boston Red Sox World Series championship season in 2004. Additional episodes currently being produced include an interview with the author of a new biography about Gordon Lightfoot and an in-depth interview with Merilee Rush (“Angel of the Morning”). During that time, the band saturated the music charts and radio stations with songs such as “I’m a Believer,” “Daydream Believer,” “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Valleri,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone” and many others. The group consisted for Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, and the four had been assembled by producers at Screen Gems for the television show. In the beginning, the members of the group didn’t have much say in the music they recorded, and their vocals were their main contributions. However, the Monkees were eventually able to wrestle away more control of the recordings, and their musical careers continued after the television show ended. This episode of Documenting Popular Music, takes a look at the individual members of the Monkees and what they did after the break up – in the 1970s and 1980s. Velez, who has a wealth of knowledge about the group, also offers some behind the scenes history, including how the Monkees and the Beatles hung out together, and how Dolenz ended up using a Beatles song in an episode of the Monkees TV show. Dan Fogelberg passed away 10 years ago this month. This episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at the tribute album and artist such as Garth Brooks, who performs “Phoenix” with Trisha Yearwood providing background vocals; the late Donna Sumer, who sings an inspiring version of “Nether Lands” using the same backing track that Fogelberg used for the 1977 classic; Amy Grant and Vince Gill, who provide a duet on “Longer” that gives new life to Fogelberg’s biggest hit; Randy Owen, the legendary voice of the group Alabama – the best-selling country group of all time – sings “Sutter’s Mill,” originally from Fogelberg’s progressive bluegrass album ‘High Country Snows;’ Zac Brown and his band deliver a live version of “Leader of the Band;” and Fogelberg’s good friend Joe Walsh of the Eagles sings “Part of the Plan,” a song he originally produced for Fogelberg for the 1974 album Souvenirs. Other artists on the album include Michael McDonald, Jimmy Buffett, Boz Scaggs, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band with Richie Furay, the late Dobie Gray, Train, Fool’s Gold (originally Fogelberg’s backing band) and Casey James. Included in this presentation is inside, background information from Fogelberg’s former record producer, Norbert Putnam, one of the tribute album’s co-producers.

(Thank you Norbert) During our conversation, he told me about Garth Brooks’ and Donna Summer’s involvement with the tribute album; however, the lineup of stars on the album had not yet been released, and Jean asked that I not use the info for the show.

Cochran would go on to re-record the song for release on Aire Records (1962), in a slightly different tempo, with some changes to the lyrics and for re-release on King Records in 1963. In all, Cochran recorded four versions of the song, the original, Gala #117, Boblo Records #101, King Records #5856, and Aire Records #150, released as \"Last Kiss\" b/w \"Edge of the Sea\", with Cochran sharing vocals with an unnamed male vocalist.

(Thank you Norbert) During our conversation, he told me about Garth Brooks’ and Donna Summer’s involvement with the tribute album; however, the lineup of stars on the album had not yet been released, and Jean asked that I not use the info for the show. I’m happy I could use Norbert’s recollections about Brooks and Summer for this review of the tribute album. to this day Cochran is the only one credited with writing \"Last Kiss\". Cochran would go on to re-record the song for release on Aire Records (1962), in a slightly different tempo, with some changes to the lyrics and for re-release on King Records in 1963. In all, Cochran recorded four versions of the song, the original, Gala #117, Boblo Records #101, King Records #5856, and Aire Records #150, released as \"Last Kiss\" b/w \"Edge of the Sea\", with Cochran sharing vocals with an unnamed male vocalist.

Wayne Cochran (vocals), Joe Carpenter (guitar), Bobby Rakestraw (bass), and Jerry Reppert (drums) recorded the song for the Gala label, a small label based in Vidalia. When the labels for the 45s, Gala #117, were printed, the names of co-writers Joe Carpenter, Randall Hoyal and Bobby McGlon were left off. Cochran evidently never asked Gala to change the label, to include the other \n\nSoldier boy, ; One kiss before you go, soldier boy ; I'll miss you, that you know, ; Ev'ry night I'll pray for you far away, ; And trust to Him above ; To send you back some day ; In my heart ; A love will always yearn, ; And I'll wait for your return.\n\n"

This rule, which originated from a famous legal case in the early 19th century, provides criteria to determine whether an individual can be held criminally responsible for their actions based on their mental state at the time of the offense. According to McNaughton's rule, a person is legally insane and not criminally responsible if, at the time of the crime, they were suffering from a mental disorder or defect that caused them to either not understand the nature and quality of their actions or not understand that their actions were morally wrong. To evaluate a defendant's mental state, the court usually relies on expert testimony from psychiatrists or psychologists, who assess the individual's mental capacity and provide insights into their understanding of the crime committed. The court will consider factors such as the presence of a mental illness, the defendant's ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions, and their ability to differentiate right from wrong. It is important to note that while McNaughton's rule is widely accepted in many countries, different jurisdictions may have variations in their definitions of criminal responsibility for the insane. In summary, McNaughton's rule is a commonly used standard to determine the criminal responsibility of the insane. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception. In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility. For example, if someone accidentally started a forest fire by dropping a match while lighting a cigarette, this would not be arson because the defendant didn't have the required criminal intent or guilty mental state.In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result.Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act.Violence is another focus of treatment with psychopaths; violent behavior can be managed with administrative disciplinary procedures within the correctional facility. By now he realized that he was not going to escape a prison term for rape, and the insanity defense was sounding more and more appealing. Dr. Huber explained that just having a mental disorder was not enough to meet the legal criteria for insanity. \"In order to be legally insane, you have to have some connection between the mental disorder and the crime,\" he said. \"There must be some evidence that the mental illness affected your ability to understand what you were doing, or that what you were doing was wrong. The state has to prove two issues to convict a defendant.

Democrats control the majority of the House of Representatives, and it’s their responsibility to provide and pass a U.S. budget. As with any Congress, it’s always easier said than done. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again. The new 116th Congress has settled in, and a clearer picture of the diverse freshman class has come to light. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) is an RN who ran on her support for health care, specifically to protect those with pre-existing conditions. Congress has settled in after the shutdown, and new members have taken their place on committees to begin the real work in Washington, DC. Neither party seems optimistic that compromise can happen by the February 15 deadline, and the future is still uncertain. Although the Democrats have yet not formally taken control of the House of Representatives, many are primed and passionate about holding the Trump administration accountable after the November midterm elections. During the November 2018 midterm election campaign, many incumbent Republicans—some of whom previously voted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act—now promised to uphold sections of the law, including protections for pre-existing conditions as their most important campaign commitment. All states except Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia held elections for their state legislatures. Republicans made substantial gains in state legislatures across the nation. Twenty chambers flipped from Democratic to Republican control, giving Republicans full control of eleven state legislatures and control of one chamber in Colorado, Iowa and New York.1 Additionally, Republicans gained enough seats in the Oregon House to produce a 30-30 party split, pushing Democrats into a power-sharing agreement that resulted in the election of two \"co-speakers\" (one from each party) to lead the chamber.

Non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories were also elected. These midterm elections took place halfway through the term of Republican President Donald Trump. On Election Day, Republicans had held a House majority since January 2011. In the 2018 elections, the Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, won control of the House. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections. The 41-seat gain was the Democrats' largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats. Upon the opening of the 116th United States Congress, Pelosi was elected as Speaker of the House. Incumbent Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan chose not to run for another term. In November 2018, House Republicans elected Kevin McCarthy as House Minority Leader. Democrats increased their seat majority from 6–4 to 7–3.

Democrats control the majority of the House of Representatives, and it’s their responsibility to provide and pass a U.S. budget. As with any Congress, it’s always easier said than done. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again. The new 116th Congress has settled in, and a clearer picture of the diverse freshman class has come to light. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) is an RN who ran on her support for health care, specifically to protect those with pre-existing conditions. Congress has settled in after the shutdown, and new members have taken their place on committees to begin the real work in Washington, DC. Neither party seems optimistic that compromise can happen by the February 15 deadline, and the future is still uncertain. Although the Democrats have yet not formally taken control of the House of Representatives, many are primed and passionate about holding the Trump administration accountable after the November midterm elections.

Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns. In 1840, Britain intervened and returned control of \n\n In 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I. Muslim rulers from Sudan and the Arabian Peninsula were dominant in the African Red Sea coast until the Ottoman Turks arrived in the 16th century. The ports of Suakin and Massawa were occupied by Özdemir Pasha, who had been appointed beylerbey in 1555, and the province of Habesh was formed \n\n In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government). Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further \n\n From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire.\n\n"

She also served as a member of the board of Uganda National Medical Stores, the pharmaceutical procurement and distribution arm of the health ministry, from 2005 until 2016. Political career\nIn July 2020, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng declared her intentions to contest for the position of Women Representative for Lira District, in the 11th Parliament (2021 - 2026). She intends to run on the ruling National Resistance Movement political party ticket. In an attempt to conserve funds, Aceng as minister has accused some universities of graduating too many substandard doctors, although both the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC) and the East African Community Medical and Dental Practitioners Boards and Councils disagree with her. Perhaps the most controversial of all her proposals is the new requirement that interns take a new national examination, before the health ministry can assign them an internship slot.\n\n"

This may include lectures, demonstrations, videos, or interactive multimedia. This can include providing explanations, answering questions, and offering additional resources for further understanding.

Their primary goal is to help students improve their understanding and performance in the subject matter they are seeking assistance with. They may use different instructional techniques, such as explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, providing additional practice materials, offering step-by-step guidance through problem-solving processes, and giving constructive feedback on assignments or assessments.

Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts. Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments. Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently. This teaching approach is widely employed in fields such as law, philosophy, and education, as it nurtures a deeper understanding and helps students become more proficient in analytical thinking and problem-solving. In conclusion, the Socratic method of teaching is an interactive and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to think critically and actively participate in the learning process.

Presenting the stimulus material: Introduce the instructional material and present it to the students in a clear and organized manner. This may include lectures, demonstrations, videos, or interactive multimedia. This can include providing explanations, answering questions, and offering additional resources for further understanding. This can involve hands-on practice with dental mannequins, simulation models, or supervised clinical practice on patients. Feedback helps them understand their strengths and areas for improvement. Assessing performance: Evaluate the students' performance to determine if they have achieved the desired level of proficiency in local anesthesia application techniques. This can be done through written exams, practical assessments, or clinical evaluations. This can be done through case studies, patient simulations, or real patient encounters. Deconstruction: The instructor breaks down the procedure into smaller components or steps, explaining each step in detail. They work closely with students on a one-on-one basis, spending dedicated time with them on a regular basis, whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly. Their primary goal is to help students improve their understanding and performance in the subject matter they are seeking assistance with. They may use different instructional techniques, such as explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, providing additional practice materials, offering step-by-step guidance through problem-solving processes, and giving constructive feedback on assignments or assessments. By providing personalized attention and support, tutors create a supportive learning environment that encourages students to ask questions, engage actively in the learning process, and develop effective study habits. been many times called the century of creativity and innovation, so as society matures, there are more and more creative people, and the need in educating such people is becoming more vivid.\" and put it into the classroom \n\n technologies, \"students have also improved their reading comprehension, writing skills, and their abilities to plan, analyze, and interpret results as they progress through the media project.\" Through this process, they are exposed to different \n\nThe Socratic method of teaching is a pedagogical approach that focuses on stimulating critical thinking and promoting active learning. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts. Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments. Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently. This teaching approach is widely employed in fields such as law, philosophy, and education, as it nurtures a deeper understanding and helps students become more proficient in analytical thinking and problem-solving. In conclusion, the Socratic method of teaching is an interactive and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to think critically and actively participate in the learning process. By asking thought-provoking questions, teachers promote analytical reasoning, foster intellectual growth, and facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\n"

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. by Bloody Disgusting. Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\".
