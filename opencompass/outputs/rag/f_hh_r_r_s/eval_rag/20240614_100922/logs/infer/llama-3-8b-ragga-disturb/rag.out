["The first pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid after a several century break was Djoser, who ruled during the 3rd Dynasty (c. 2667-2601 BCE). Prior to Djoser's reign, pharaohs were buried in mastabas, which were simple rectangular structures with flat roofs. However, Djoser's vizier, Imhotep, designed a new type of tomb for the pharaoh, which was a stepped pyramid. This new design was a significant departure from the traditional mastaba, and it set a new standard for royal burials in ancient Egypt. The stepped pyramid was constructed at Saqqara, and it was the first true pyramid to be built in Egypt. The pyramid was surrounded by smaller pyramids for Djoser's wives and other members of the royal family. The construction of the stepped pyramid marked a significant shift in the way that pharaohs were buried, and it paved the way for the construction of the larger and more elaborate pyramids that would follow.", 'Who was the first pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid after  a several century break?']

Djoser's pyramid was first built as a square mastaba like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today. Later pharaohs, including Sekhemkhet and possibly Khaba, built similar structures, known as the Buried Pyramid and the Layer Pyramid, respectively. In the Fourth Dynasty, the Egyptians began to build "true pyramids" with smooth sides.

  The earliest Egyptian pyramids were step pyramids. In the First Dynasty at Saqqara, a large step pyramid like structure was found within the interior of Mastaba 3808 dating to the reign of the pharaoh Anedjib. Egyptologist Walter B Emery found other mastabas of this late 1st Dynasty period that may have been of similar design in which several inscriptions depicting step pyramids during this era are also found, mostly credited to Anedjib's successor Qa'a. The first recognized step pyramid, however, dates to the beginning of the Third Dynasty attributed to the pharaoh Djoser.

  open courtyard, and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period. The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs. The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia.

The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built c. undefined during the Third Dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years.

  The Pyramid of Reherishefnakht is the tomb of the ancient Egyptian official Reherishefnakht. It is located in south Saqqara and was built right next to the Pyramid of the 6th Dynasty Pharaoh Pepi I. Reherishefnakht's pyramid however was probably built at the end of the 11th Dynasty or the beginning of the 12th Dynasty. It is the oldest Egyptian pyramid built for a person who was not a member of the royal family. The pyramid was discovered a few years before it was first excavated by Audran Labrousse and the Mission Archéologique Française de Saqqâra in 2005.

  of the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150–2686 BCE), Egyptians with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas. At Saqqara, Mastaba 3808, dating from the latter part of the 1st Dynasty, was discovered to contain a large, independently built step-pyramid-like structure enclosed within the outer palace facade mastaba. Archaeological remains and inscriptions suggest there may have been other similar structures dating to this period. The first historically documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed by Egyptologists to the 3rd Dynasty pharaoh Djoser.

Under King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the royal capital of Egypt was moved to Memphis, where Djoser established his court. A new era of building was initiated at Saqqara under his reign. King Djoser's architect, Imhotep, is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural form, the step pyramid. The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known for a large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt's kings.

  concerning the location of Neferhotep's tomb included that proposed by Nicolas Grimal, that Neferhotep was buried in a pyramid at el-Lisht, close to that of Senusret I, an opinion shared by Michael Rice. This remains conjectural, as no artefact permitting the identification of Neferhotep as the owner of such a pyramid has been found. Grimal's hypothesis relies only on indirect evidence: the presence of scarabs of Neferhotep in Lisht as well as the discovery of a shawabti of a prince Wahneferhotep "(King) Neferhotep endures" close to the northern gateway of the mortuary temple of the pyramid complex of Senusret I.

["The triangular decorative surface found on the each end of Greek temples is called a gable. This feature is also known as a pediment, which is a triangular roof or ceiling. The gable is typically decorated with intricate carvings, sculptures, or paintings, and serves as a focal point for the temple's design. The gable's shape is a result of the temple's roofline, which is typically a pitched or sloping roof. The gable's shape also helps to distribute weight evenly and prevent structural damage. The gable is an important architectural element in Greek temples, as it represents the temple's spiritual and cultural significance.\n\n\nIn Greek temples, the gable is typically found on the front and back of the temple, and is often decorated with intricate carvings, sculptures, or paintings.

  Above the frieze, or an intermediate member, e.g. the dentil of the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the cornice protrudes notably. It consists of the geison (on the sloped sides or pediments of the narrow walls a sloped geison), and the sima. On the long side, the sima, often elaborately decorated, was equipped with water spouts, often in the shape of lions' heads. The pedimental triangle or tympanon on the narrow sides of the temple was created by the Doric introduction of the gabled roof, earlier temples often had hipped roofs. The tympanon was usually richly decorated with pedimental sculpture of mythical scenes or battles. The corners and ridges of the roof were decorated with acroteria, originally geometric, later floral or figural decorations.

Greek temples with pediment sculptures usually had them at both ends of the temple, and tended to have contrasting scenes, one perhaps a peaceful scene with deities, and the other with a battle or dramatic scene from mythology. Over the next decades refinements were made in the design and carving of pedimental sculpture, "a small Hyrda pediment" in Athens (about 570 BCE), the "Bluebeard pediment from the 'old Athena temple' the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (about 525 BCE), the Megarian Treasury at Olympia (about 520–510 BCE),

   Pedimental sculpture is a form of architectural sculpture designed for installation in the tympanum, the space enclosed by the architectural element called the pediment. Originally a feature of Ancient Greek architecture, pedimental sculpture started as a means to decorate a pediment in its simplest form: a low triangle, like a gable, above an horizontal base or entablature. However, as classical architecture developed from the basis of Ancient Greek and Roman architecture, the varieties of pedimental sculpture also developed. The sculpture can be either freestanding or relief sculpture, in which case it is attached to the back wall of the pediment. Harris in The Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture defines pediment as "In classical architecture, the triangular gable end of the roof above the horizontal cornice, often filled with sculpture." Pediments can also be used to crown doors or windows. In Romanesque architecture, and very often in Gothic architecture, the tympanum is usually semi-circular at the top, and the sculptural groups, usually with religious subjects, adapted to fit the new spaces. In the Renaissance triangular pediments returned, as gradually did sculptural groups within them, becoming very popular for important buildings in the 19th century.

  The pediment begins in Ancient Greek architecture; according to the mid-fifth century BCE poet Pindar, it was a Corinthian invention. It is possible that it was devised specifically to contain sculpture, which from the early 6th century became "customary (though never obligatory)" in Doric temples; in Ionic ones it was a "rarity". A difference between the ancient Greek temple and temples of other, older, cultures of the Near East was that the visual effect and decoration of the exterior exceeded that of the interiors and exteriors behind the main facade. Like the other forms of exterior decoration such as statues, antefixes, and acroteria,

  Special attention was paid to the decoration of the pediments, not least because of their size and frontal position. Pedimental sculpture was originally in massive relief figures, as in the earliest to survive, from shortly after 600 BCE, on the temple of Artemis at Kerkyra, where the west pediment is taken up by the gorgon Medusa and her children at the centre, flanked by panthers. Smaller scenes are displayed in the low corners of the pediments, including Zeus with a thunderbolt, fighting a Giant. The pedimental sculpture of the first peripteral temple on the Athenian Acropolis, from c. 570 BCE, is nearly free-standing sculpture, but remains dominated by a central

  The capitals support the entablature. In the Doric order, the entablature always consists of two parts, the architrave and the Doric frieze (or triglyph frieze). The Ionic order of Athens and the Cyclades also used a frieze above an architrave, whereas the frieze remained unknown in the Ionic architecture of Asia Minor until the 4th century BCE. There, the architrave was directly followed by the dentils. The frieze was originally placed in front of the roof beams, which were externally visible only in the earlier temples of Asia Minor. The Doric frieze was structured by triglyphs. These were placed above the axis of

  The cult statue was often oriented towards an altar, placed axially in front of the temple. To preserve this connection, the single row of columns often found along the central axis of the naos in early temples was replaced by two separate rows towards the sides. The central one of the three aisles thereby created was often emphasised as the main one. The dignity of the central aisle of the naos could be underlined by the use of special elements of design. For example, the oldest known Corinthian capitals are from the naoi of Doric temples. The impressiveness of the internal aisle could be emphasised further by having a third row of columns along the back, as is the case at the Parthenon and at the temple of Zeus in Nemea.

  The Israel Hall House is a historic building located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa, United States. By the time this house was built, Israel Hall had retired and was serving as the secretary-treasurer of the Oakdale Cemetery Corporation. He may have used it as a boarding house as well. The two-story brick house is a late example of the Greek Revival style. The side gable is influenced by the Georgian Revival as opposed to the temple front that is more typical of the Greek Revival. The round-arch window in the attic is typical feature found in Davenport residential architecture in this era. An addition to the back of the house was built around 1895. The house features a gabled roof, while the addition featured a hipped roof. The single bay porch on the front of the house replaced a full sized porch that was also not original, but replaced the original single-bay porch. The house rests on a raised lot and is set back from the street level. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984.

["The ration shop in India opened for the first time in 1947, following the country's independence from British rule. The Indian government established a system of rationing to ensure that essential commodities such as rice, wheat, sugar, and kerosene were available to all citizens, particularly those in rural and remote areas. The rationing system was designed to address the shortages and price hikes that had plagued the country during World War II and the immediate post-independence period. The ration shop became a vital source of food and other essentials for millions of Indians, particularly those living in poverty. Over time, the rationing system evolved and was gradually phased out as the country's economy grew and food production increased. Today, the ration shop is a relic of a bygone era, but its legacy continues to shape India's food and economic policies.", 'When did the ration shop open in india for the first time?']

In the previous two decades, India has been developing at a quick pace and an increasing demand for high-value foods with a shift towards horticultural crops has been documented. This, coupled with rapid urbanisation resulted in multi-fold changes to the spending and consumption pattern of India's population. The existing food supply chain systems were unable to cope with these fast-changing demographic trends and the lack of efficient and effective

This company started off with a paid-up capital of inr 600000, and the shareholding was confined to the canteen contractors. The CCS functioned with reasonable efficiency until the commencement of World War II. However, after the heavy buildup of the British troops in India, the CCS could no longer cope-up with the situation.

   Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were rationed. Perishable items such as fruit were not rationed. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew "victory gardens", and small home vegetable gardens. Many goods were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own. The rationing system, which was originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal "national loaf". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.

  II. The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including Burma, had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons. "Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920.

  and the organization functioned extremely well during the War. By 31 March 1946, it was not only able to pay back to the government the assignments of funds made available to it but could also function on its own trading capital. However, with the end of the war and homeward movement of the British troops, the import facilities dwindled and the turnover of the organization shrank. With the pulling out of troops from the operational areas, the Indian Canteen Corps was disbanded and the staff retrenched. This was closely followed by the independence and partition of the country, and the wartime organization gave birth to two Canteen Stores Departments, i.e., CSD (India) and CSD

  The Canteen Stores Department traces its origins to the British Raj, when the Army Canteen Board was established in India as an offshoot of the Navy and the Army Canteen Board in the United Kingdom. Although the Navy and the Army Canteen Board was abolished in the UK in 1922, and was replaced by the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI), its counterpart in India continued to function until 1927. The Army Canteen Board in India was established mainly to provide canteen facilities to British troops in India through grocery shops and bars run by canteen contractors. The Army Canteen Board was liquidated in 1927, and replaced by the Canteen Contractors' Syndicate (CCS).

  The Indian food security system was established by the Government of India under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution to distribute food and non-food items to India's poor at subsidised rates. Major commodities distributed include staple food grains, such as wheat, rice, sugar and essential fuels like kerosene, through a network of fair price shops (also known as ration shops) established in several states across the country. Food Corporation of India, a government-owned corporation, procures and maintains the public distribution system (PDS).

  A public distribution shop, also known as fair price shop (FPS), is a part of India's public system established by the Government of India which distributes rations at a subsidized price to the poor. Locally these are known as ration shops and public distribution shops, and chiefly sell wheat, rice and sugar at a price lower than the market price called Issue Price. Other essential commodities may also be sold. To buy items one must have a ration card. These shops are operated throughout the country by joint assistance of central and state government. The items from these shops are much cheaper but are of average quality. Ration shops are now present in most localities, villages towns and cities. India has more than 5.5 lakh (0.55 million) shops, constituting the largest distribution network in the world.

  the east during the latter half of the 19th century. Romesh Chunder Dutt argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as Amartya Sen agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in Afghanistan (see The Second Anglo-Afghan War), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain.

  The Pakistani CSD would later bifurcate further to form CSD (Bangladesh), after the independence of Bangladesh. The retail trade, however, reverted to the contractors. A board of Liquidation was formed to oversee the liquidation of assets of the war-time organization which ceased to function from 31 December 1947. The Canteen Stores Department, the present organization, thus took birth on 1 January 1948 with a working capital of inr 4800000 assigned to it from assets of its predecessor wartime organization. The Government of India had granted the organization a life of three years on experimental basis. The situation was reviewed in 1950 and the Department was accepted as a government undertaking on a permanent basis.

  According to the Wigan Observer of 21 June 1920, Wigan Borough was originally formed as the amateur side Wigan United in November 1919, although the club predates this by at least two months as records exist from the previous September. It is also possible that United were a continuation of the club who played at Springfield Park some 20 years earlier. United played 18 games in the 1919–20 season as members of the West Lancashire League and also entered the Richardson Cup. The club applied to join the Lancashire Combination for the 1920–21 season and continued as Wigan United for a further nine games (P9 L9) before being forced to close by the Lancashire FA as they were found guilty of paying their players for "lost time", which contravened rules

  the time. A new club, Wigan Association, was formed on 6 November 1920, taking over the fixtures of Wigan United for four games (P4 D1 L3). After this short period the F.A. agreed that all their demands had been met with the exception that the club would have to change their name again to avoid confusion with Wigan FC, the town's rugby league team, allowing Wigan Association to become officially known as Wigan Borough Football Club on 11 December 1920. The newly named Wigan Borough applied for entrance to the football league's Third Division North for the 1921–22 season, despite only finishing 17th of 18 clubs in the Lancashire Combination league. Astonishingly, they were, along with Barrow and Accrington Stanley, granted a place for the inaugural season of the competition.

  The 2017–18 EFL Cup was the 58th season of the EFL Cup. The competition was open to all 92 clubs participating in the Premier League and the English Football League. It was known as the Carabao Cup due to the start of a sponsorship deal with Carabao Energy Drinks after the tournament was unsponsored the previous year. The final took place at Wembley Stadium in London. Manchester City won their fifth title after a 3–0 win over Arsenal in the final. Manchester United were the defending champions, but they were eliminated by Bristol City in the fifth round.

  The 2018 EFL Cup Final (also known as the 2018 Carabao Cup Final for sponsorship reasons) was the final association football match of the 2017–18 EFL Cup that took place on 25 February 2018 at Wembley Stadium. It was the first League Cup final contested under the "Carabao Cup" name following the sponsorship of Carabao Energy Drink. It was contested between Manchester City and Arsenal, and won 3–0 by Manchester City. They would have entered the second qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, but instead qualified directly for the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League by finishing first in the 2017–18 Premier League. The match was Manchester City's sixth League Cup Final, and their third in five seasons – qualification for the final also marked the first time Pep Guardiola reached a final with Manchester City. For Arsenal, the final was their eighth total in the competition, and their third of Arsène Wenger's managerial reign.

  (eventually culminating in an on-pitch protest that forced their final game of the season to be abandoned), as well as the fact that they had only eight players two weeks before the season started. Wigan Athletic were also relegated, just two years after they had won the FA Cup and played in the Premier League. During the season, they went through three managers and failed to win a home game between September and April as the extra games from the previous season appeared to take its toll on the Latics. Millwall filled the final relegation spot, having sacked Ian Holloway in March and appointed Neil Harris as his replacement, but he couldn't save them from the drop to the third tier.

Until 2018, the worst team received 250 combinations, the second worst getting 199, the third worst team 156, and so on. The first three draft picks were determined. Starting in 2019, the three worst teams receive 140 combinations each, the fourth worst 125, and so on. Those three teams will have an equal chance of winning the top overall pick.

The team with the worst record receives the best odds of receiving the first pick. The NBA introduced the lottery process in 1985. The league was attempting to counter accusations that certain teams were purposefully losing in order to gain a chance to participate in the annual coin flip, where the worst team in each division flips a coin to see who will receive the first pick in the upcoming draft.

  based on their record in the previous season, like in the previous system. The lottery is generally held in the third or fourth week of May. The NBA goes to great lengths in order to keep the selection process both fair and not tampered with in any way. "The actual Lottery procedure will take place in a separate room just prior to the national broadcast on ESPN. Select media members, NBA officials and representatives of the participating teams and the accounting firm of Ernst & Young will be in attendance for the drawing." Attendees are not allowed cell phone or any other electronic access until the number one pick is revealed on the television broadcast.

  The first 14 picks in the draft belonged to teams that had missed the playoffs; the order was determined through a lottery. The lottery would determine the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. On April 20, 2007, the NBA performed a tie-breaker to determine the order of the picks for teams with identical win-loss record. The lottery was held on May 22, 2007 in Secaucus, New Jersey. The Portland Trail Blazers, who had the seventh-worst record in the previous season, won the lottery with just a 5.3% chance to win. This was the fourth time that

  Blazers had the first overall draft pick and the first time that the Blazers won the draft lottery since it was introduced in 1985. The Seattle Supersonics, who had the fifth-worst record, and the Atlanta Hawks, who had the fourth-worst record, obtained the second and third pick, respectively. Three teams who had the worst records—the Memphis Grizzlies, the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks—obtained the fourth, fifth and sixth pick, respectively. These were the lowest possible picks they could have obtained through the lottery. The most recent draft in which the three worst teams did not receive the top three picks was in 1993. Below were the chances for each team to get specific picks in the 2007 draft lottery, rounded to three decimal places:

 Notes The largest upset in the lottery occurred in 1993 when the Magic won the lottery with just a 1.5% chance to win. The second largest upsets occurred in 2008 and 2014 when the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers both won their respective lotteries with just a 1.7% chance. In 1999, the Charlotte Hornets also overcame long odds in the draft lottery when they won the third pick despite having the best record among all non-playoff teams. The Hornets only had a 1.83% chance of winning a top-three pick. Since the lottery was introduced in 1985, only 21 of 30 NBA teams have won the lottery. The Los Angeles Clippers have won five lotteries, although two of them were conveyed to other teams in trades prior to the lottery. The Orlando Magic, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Brooklyn Nets are second with three lottery wins each. Since the weighted lottery system was introduced in 1990, only seven teams with the worst record went on to win the lottery while only four teams with the second-worst record have won the lottery.

  On December 12, 2013, the 2014 WNBA Draft Lottery took place. The Connecticut Sun, who had a league-worst record of 10-24 last season, won the draft lottery and had the right to pick first in the 2014 draft. In the draft, held on April 14, the Sun made Chiney Ogwumike of Stanford University the top pick.

After the top four positions are selected (from the lottery slotting system), the remainder of the first-round draft order is in inverse order of the win-loss record for the remaining teams, or the teams who originally held the lottery rights if they were traded.

Beginning with the 2019 draft, the NBA changed the lottery odds (the bottom three teams will all have an equal 14% chance of winning the top pick) and increased the number of teams selected in the lottery from three to four.

  In 1990, the NBA changed the format of the lottery to give the team with the worst record the best chance of landing the first pick. The worst non-playoff team that season would have 11 chances, out of 66, to obtain the first pick. The second worst would have 10 chances, and so on. Similarly to the previous system, the weighted lottery system was also used only to determine the first three picks, while the rest of the teams selected in reverse order of their win-loss records.

  The Beyond (...E tu vivrai nel terrore! L'aldilà, lit. "...And you will live in terror! The afterlife") is a 1981 Italian Southern Gothic supernatural horror film directed by Lucio Fulci, from an original story created by Dardano Sacchetti, and starring Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck. Its plot follows a woman who inherits a hotel in rural Louisiana that was once the site of a horrific murder, and which may be a gateway to hell. It is the second film in Fulci's "Gates of Hell" trilogy after City of the Living Dead (1980), and was followed by The House by the Cemetery (1981). Filmed on location in and around New Orleans in late 1980 with assistance from the Louisiana Film Commission, additional photography took place at De Paolis Studios in Rome.

 Most Likely to Survive: The Story of Matthew Faulkner's Miraculous Recovery from Traumatic Brain Injury is a non-fiction work written by Joe Kirchmyer and the book's subject, Matt Faulkner. The book was released in March 2013 and details a car accident in which Faulkner was a passenger. This occurred just a few months prior to his graduation from West Seneca West Senior High School (WSW) in 2009. Faulkner suffered from a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which left him in a coma for nearly two months. He spent three weeks on life support in the ICU at the Erie County Medical Center. He walked out of the hospital after 103 days and then received his high school diploma from West Seneca West just 12 days later.  The book's title is a reference to Faulkner being named "Most Likely to Succeed" by his high school graduating class shortly before the accident.

The book details Faulkner's life leading up to the accident, including his family life and having earned a place in the top ten percent of his high school graduating class, as well as admission to the all-college honors program at Canisius College[1]. A large majority of the book covers his hospitalization, rehabilitation, and his life in the years after the injury, including starting school at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, and working towards his college graduation in 2013.

The book closes with a personal note from Faulkner about his aspirations for a new approach to TBI rehabilitation, including "our society to reach some type of recognition that brain injury does happen, and that we need to do more for the victims, especially the young people who suffer from such an awful occurrence." He goes on to establish his ambition of seeing better TBI rehabilitation and outcomes.

Release 
On March 23, 2013, the book was released with the documentary film, Recovery (2016), at the film's "grand Buffalo screening" which took place at University at Buffalo (UB) Center for the Arts[4]. The documentary film, which also documents Faulkner's accident, TBI and life after, was first test screened in Buffalo, New York in 2013, applied to film festivals in 2014, premiered at a film festival in 2015, and became publicly available in 2016. Additionally, the film has streamed for free on FilmFreeway since September 7, 2017.

Recovery was directed and produced by Ryan Monolopolus, who also graduated from WSW alongside Faulkner and remained friends with him following high school. Monolopolus was interviewed by the West Seneca Central School District for their Spring 2017 newsletter, and indicated that the film's debut screening at UB was "the largest screening for a student work ever at UB."

According to Monolopolus' resume, the film was allegedly selected as the "Best Documentary" at the "Speak Here, First" film festival in 2015, although no other reference to this can be found.

According to Monolopolus' website, Recovery was shot in collaboration with Mercy Flight and Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), and includes footage of a reenacted helicopter flight to ECMC, giving a portrayal of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) air transport that was available to Faulkner to rush him to the hospital. The film had an approximate budget of $15,000.

Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. The book remains available on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats.

Community Engagement 
Prior to the release of the book and documentary film, Faulkner was interviewed by Melissa Holmes of WGRZ, a local news station in Buffalo, NY. Holmes interviewed both Faulkner and Monolopolus for the TV news feature in the Canisius College library. Monolopolus told Holmes that "Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. Not just from a medical injury, but how do people move on from anything that may be traumatic or jarring in their lives?"

In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people "...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible."

Since the release of the book and documentary, Faulkner has spoken publicly on the topics of TBI, rehabilitation, motivation and recovery. In 2014, Monolopolus produced several TV ad spots for Mercy Flight, including one which featured Faulkner describing his accident and the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) service provided by Mercy Flight.

In 2018, Faulkner was a featured guest of Amy Zellmer on her podcast, Faces of TBI, during which he described the book and documentary as a "launching point" for him to share his experience with others, including students and nurses. He also indicated some of the past opportunities he has had to speak to groups, including at the 2015 WSW National Honor Society induction ceremony, as well as speaking to a graduate level physical therapy class at UB each year since 2014.

In 2019, he delivered the commencement address at both the West Seneca West (WSW), and East (WSE) Senior High School graduations, commenting that he works on "community awareness projects where I go to groups and speak about my experiences and rehabilitation and my experience with my brain injury and things like that. I’ve spoken to groups of nurses and other clinicians. I go to speak [with] students at UB in physical therapy every year."

Later in 2019, Faulkner participated in a video feature in support of Mercy Flight, describing his accident, the EMS support, his recovery and motivations. The video was featured at the 2019 "Beacon of Hope Gala" to raise money for their causes.

In November 2020, Faulkner gave a virtual presentation to the seniors in National Honor Society (NHS) at WSW. Presenting as both an alumnus and a former NHS board member, he shared his experience with adapting to significant change during his senior year of high school, reminding them to remain flexible with their plans as they are likely to change with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December 2020, Faulkner was recorded for two videos for the Brainwaves Video Anthology channel on YouTube. In the videos, Faulkner shared his story, and how he hopes to have an impact on the lives of others, just as so many others helped him.

Further Writing 
In March 2019, Faulkner posted a reflection to WordPress to share his experience and commemorate the ten year anniversary of his TBI. In the blog post, he shared his first thoughts about waking from the coma:

When I woke up alone on a cold hospital floor–the result of my intention to escape what I had thought was a nightmare–the first thing I realized was that my legs did not work like they used to. Screaming nurses swarmed to my attention, so I knew that something was wrong. The last thing I remembered was enjoying a fully functional and lazy Sunday, the final day of mid-winter break from my Senior year of high school. Apparently, months had gone by–the calendar on the wall already had the first few days of May crossed off.

The nightmare was real. There were things that I could not remember happening and there was no changing that, no matter how difficult that was for me to grasp. That moment, on the floor, is when I tell people I woke up from the coma, although my doctor would say differently. Two weeks prior, after following the simple command of "squeeze my finger," I was declared "awake."

That moment, on the floor, I had to accept that everyone around me was telling the truth when they said that I was in an accident.

I had suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

Further, he describes the details of his injuries, emergency medical care and prognosis:

In addition to being entirely unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale of 3-4), I was not breathing, in decerebrate posturing, and in cardiac arrest. The team of first responders, most of whom volunteer firefighters, were responsible for performing CPR, intubating me, and administering epinephrine at the scene to jump-start my heart. Once I was stabilized, they alerted Mercy Flight of WNY to rapidly transport me to the TICU at Erie County Medical Center (ECMC). The brilliant attending neurosurgeon, Dr. Gregory Bennett MD, effectively mitigated the bleeding and swelling inside my brain, which was due to intracranial bleeding and an intraparenchymal contusion. The procedure helped prevent further brain damage from brain herniation and increased my chances of having a "good" outcome, or being able to live without constant care. The chances of that happening were about 1 in 10, according to prognostic models. But first I had to survive–a mere 20% likelihood. In the first week, my parents were advised that they may have to make a decision to remove me from life support in the near future.

However grim the prognosis, I survived the acute stages and a serious lung infection. I spent exactly three weeks in the TICU before I was stable enough to be transferred and admitted to the "Coma Stim" rehabilitation program under the outstanding care of my physiatrist, Dr. Gary Wang MD, PhD. It would be another three weeks until I was officially declared awake.

Faulkner writes further about his rehabilitation, leaving the hospital and preparing for college. He then includes a follow-up about his life in the years following the release of the book and documentary film, Recovery.

 Most Likely to Survive: The Story of Matthew Faulkner's Miraculous Recovery from Traumatic Brain Injury is a non-fiction work written by Joe Kirchmyer and the book's subject, Matt Faulkner. The book was released in March 2013 and details a car accident in which Faulkner was a passenger. This occurred just a few months prior to his graduation from West Seneca West Senior High School (WSW) in 2009. Faulkner suffered from a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which left him in a coma for nearly two months. He spent three weeks on life support in the ICU at the Erie County Medical Center. He walked out of the hospital after 103 days and then received his high school diploma from West Seneca West just 12 days later.  The book's title is a reference to Faulkner being named "Most Likely to Succeed" by his high school graduating class shortly before the accident.

The book details Faulkner's life leading up to the accident, including his family life and having earned a place in the top ten percent of his high school graduating class, as well as admission to the all-college honors program at Canisius College[1]. A large majority of the book covers his hospitalization, rehabilitation, and his life in the years after the injury, including starting school at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, and working towards his college graduation in 2013.

The book closes with a personal note from Faulkner about his aspirations for a new approach to TBI rehabilitation, including "our society to reach some type of recognition that brain injury does happen, and that we need to do more for the victims, especially the young people who suffer from such an awful occurrence." He goes on to establish his ambition of seeing better TBI rehabilitation and outcomes.

Release 
On March 23, 2013, the book was released with the documentary film, Recovery (2016), at the film's "grand Buffalo screening" which took place at University at Buffalo (UB) Center for the Arts[4]. The documentary film, which also documents Faulkner's accident, TBI and life after, was first test screened in Buffalo, New York in 2013, applied to film festivals in 2014, premiered at a film festival in 2015, and became publicly available in 2016. Additionally, the film has streamed for free on FilmFreeway since September 7, 2017.

Recovery was directed and produced by Ryan Monolopolus, who also graduated from WSW alongside Faulkner and remained friends with him following high school. Monolopolus was interviewed by the West Seneca Central School District for their Spring 2017 newsletter, and indicated that the film's debut screening at UB was "the largest screening for a student work ever at UB."

According to Monolopolus' resume, the film was allegedly selected as the "Best Documentary" at the "Speak Here, First" film festival in 2015, although no other reference to this can be found.

According to Monolopolus' website, Recovery was shot in collaboration with Mercy Flight and Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), and includes footage of a reenacted helicopter flight to ECMC, giving a portrayal of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) air transport that was available to Faulkner to rush him to the hospital. The film had an approximate budget of $15,000.

Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. The book remains available on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats.

Community Engagement 
Prior to the release of the book and documentary film, Faulkner was interviewed by Melissa Holmes of WGRZ, a local news station in Buffalo, NY. Holmes interviewed both Faulkner and Monolopolus for the TV news feature in the Canisius College library. Monolopolus told Holmes that "Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. Not just from a medical injury, but how do people move on from anything that may be traumatic or jarring in their lives?"

In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people "...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible."

Since the release of the book and documentary, Faulkner has spoken publicly on the topics of TBI, rehabilitation, motivation and recovery. In 2014, Monolopolus produced several TV ad spots for Mercy Flight, including one which featured Faulkner describing his accident and the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) service provided by Mercy Flight.

In 2018, Faulkner was a featured guest of Amy Zellmer on her podcast, Faces of TBI, during which he described the book and documentary as a "launching point" for him to share his experience with others, including students and nurses. He also indicated some of the past opportunities he has had to speak to groups, including at the 2015 WSW National Honor Society induction ceremony, as well as speaking to a graduate level physical therapy class at UB each year since 2014.

In 2019, he delivered the commencement address at both the West Seneca West (WSW), and East (WSE) Senior High School graduations, commenting that he works on "community awareness projects where I go to groups and speak about my experiences and rehabilitation and my experience with my brain injury and things like that. I’ve spoken to groups of nurses and other clinicians. I go to speak [with] students at UB in physical therapy every year."

Later in 2019, Faulkner participated in a video feature in support of Mercy Flight, describing his accident, the EMS support, his recovery and motivations. The video was featured at the 2019 "Beacon of Hope Gala" to raise money for their causes.

In November 2020, Faulkner gave a virtual presentation to the seniors in National Honor Society (NHS) at WSW. Presenting as both an alumnus and a former NHS board member, he shared his experience with adapting to significant change during his senior year of high school, reminding them to remain flexible with their plans as they are likely to change with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December 2020, Faulkner was recorded for two videos for the Brainwaves Video Anthology channel on YouTube. In the videos, Faulkner shared his story, and how he hopes to have an impact on the lives of others, just as so many others helped him.

Further Writing 
In March 2019, Faulkner posted a reflection to WordPress to share his experience and commemorate the ten year anniversary of his TBI. In the blog post, he shared his first thoughts about waking from the coma:

When I woke up alone on a cold hospital floor–the result of my intention to escape what I had thought was a nightmare–the first thing I realized was that my legs did not work like they used to. Screaming nurses swarmed to my attention, so I knew that something was wrong. The last thing I remembered was enjoying a fully functional and lazy Sunday, the final day of mid-winter break from my Senior year of high school. Apparently, months had gone by–the calendar on the wall already had the first few days of May crossed off.

The nightmare was real. There were things that I could not remember happening and there was no changing that, no matter how difficult that was for me to grasp. That moment, on the floor, is when I tell people I woke up from the coma, although my doctor would say differently. Two weeks prior, after following the simple command of "squeeze my finger," I was declared "awake."

That moment, on the floor, I had to accept that everyone around me was telling the truth when they said that I was in an accident.

I had suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

Most Likely to Survive: The Story of Matthew Faulkner's Miraculous Recovery from Traumatic Brain Injury is a non-fiction work written by Joe Kirchmyer and the book's subject, Matt Faulkner. The book was released in March 2013 and details a car accident in which Faulkner was a passenger. Release 
On March 23, 2013, the book was released with the documentary film, Recovery (2016), at the film's "grand Buffalo screening" which took place at University at Buffalo (UB) Center for the Arts[4]. The documentary film, which also documents Faulkner's accident, TBI and life after, was first test screened in Buffalo, New York in 2013, applied to film festivals in 2014, premiered at a film festival in 2015, and became publicly available in 2016. Additionally, the film has streamed for free on FilmFreeway since September 7, 2017. Recovery was directed and produced by Ryan Monolopolus, who also graduated from WSW alongside Faulkner and remained friends with him following high school. Monolopolus was interviewed by the West Seneca Central School District for their Spring 2017 newsletter, and indicated that the film's debut screening at UB was "the largest screening for a student work ever at UB." According to Monolopolus' resume, the film was allegedly selected as the "Best Documentary" at the "Speak Here, First" film festival in 2015, although no other reference to this can be found. According to Monolopolus' website, Recovery was shot in collaboration with Mercy Flight and Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), and includes footage of a reenacted helicopter flight to ECMC, giving a portrayal of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) air transport that was available to Faulkner to rush him to the hospital. The film had an approximate budget of $15,000. Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. The book remains available on Amazon.com in both paperback and eBook formats. Monolopolus told Holmes that "Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people "...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible."

['The sway bar, also known as an anti-roll bar, is a suspension component that helps to reduce body roll during cornering. It is typically located in the front and rear of the vehicle, connecting the left and right sides of the suspension system. The sway bar works by applying a force to the left and right suspension components, which helps to counteract the force that is trying to roll the vehicle over during a turn. This helps to improve handling and stability, making the vehicle feel more responsive and controlled. The sway bar is typically made of steel or aluminum, and can be adjusted or removed depending on the desired level of performance or comfort.\n\nIn terms of location, the sway bar is typically mounted underneath the vehicle, near the wheels. The front sway bar is typically located near the engine, while the rear sway bar is typically located near the differential. The exact location can vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle, as well as any modifications that have been made to the suspension system.\n\nOverall, the sway bar is an important component of the suspension system, and can have a significant impact on the handling and performance of the vehicle. By reducing body roll during cornering, the sway bar helps to improve stability and control, making the vehicle feel more responsive and enjoyable to drive.', 'where is the sway bar located on a car']

   An anti-roll bar (roll bar, anti-sway bar, sway bar, stabilizer bar) is a part of many automobile suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns—independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919. Anti-roll bars were unusual on pre-war cars due to the generally much stiffer suspension and acceptance of body roll. From the 1950s on, however, production cars were more commonly fitted with anti-roll bars, especially those vehicles with softer coil spring suspension.

    An anti-sway or anti-roll bar is intended to force each side of the vehicle to lower, or rise, to similar heights, to reduce the sideways tilting (roll) of the vehicle on curves, sharp corners, or large bumps. With the bar removed, a vehicle's wheels can tilt away by much larger distances, as shown in the SUV image at right. Although there are many variations in design, a common function is to force the opposite wheel's shock absorber, spring, or suspension rod to lower or rise to a similar level as the other wheel. In a fast turn, a vehicle tends to drop closer onto the outer wheels, and the sway bar soon forces the opposite wheel to also get closer to the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle tends to "hug"

 1) from the heavily loaded axle ; 2) to the connected end link via a bushing ; 3) to the anti-sway (torsion) bar via a flexible joint ; 4) to the connected end link on the opposite side of the vehicle ; 5) to the opposite axle. A sway bar is usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions. It is usually constructed out of a cylindrical steel bar, formed into a "U" shape, that connects to the body at two points, and at the left and right sides of the suspension. If the left and right wheels move together, the bar rotates about its mounting points. If

  Because an anti-roll bar connects wheels on opposite sides of the vehicle, the bar transmits the force of a bump on one wheel to the opposite wheel. On rough or broken pavement, anti-roll bars can produce jarring, side-to-side body motions (a "waddling" sensation), which increase in severity with the diameter and stiffness of the sway bars. Other suspension techniques can delay or dampen this effect of the connecting bar. Excessive roll stiffness, typically achieved by configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, can make the inside wheels lift off the ground during hard cornering. This can be used to advantage: many front wheel drive production cars lift a rear wheel when cornering hard in order to overload the opposite wheel, limiting understeer.

  Anti-roll bars are suspension components designed to mitigate body roll. They do this by connecting the wheels at either end of an axle with a torsion bar attached to the vehicle body. Body roll can also be reduced by lowering centre of mass of the vehicle body, fitting stiffer suspension springs and reducing the sprung mass of the vehicle.

  Anti-roll bars provide two main functions. The first function is the reduction of body lean. The reduction of body lean is dependent on the total roll stiffness of the vehicle. Increasing the total roll stiffness of a vehicle does not change the steady state total load (weight) transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total lateral load transfer is determined by the CG height and track width. The other function of anti-roll bars is to tune the handling balance of a car. Understeer or oversteer behavior can be tuned out by changing the proportion of the total roll stiffness that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the front increases the proportion of the total load transfer that the front axle reacts to—and decreases the proportion that the rear axle reacts to. In general, this makes the outer front wheel run at a comparatively higher slip angle, and the outer rear wheel to run at a comparatively lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the rear axle has the opposite effect and decreases understeer.

 Geometric roll center is solely dictated by the suspension geometry, and can be found using principles of the instant center of rotation. ; Force based roll center, according to the US SAE's, is "The point in the transverse vertical plane through any pair of wheel centers at which lateral forces may be applied to the sprung mass without producing suspension roll".  The lateral location of the roll center is typically at the center-line of the vehicle when the suspension on the left and right sides of the car are mirror images of each other. The significance of the roll center can only be appreciated when the vehicle's center of mass is also considered. If there is a difference between the position of the center of mass and the roll center a moment arm is created. When the vehicle experiences angular velocity due to cornering, the length of the moment arm, combined with the stiffness of the springs and possibly anti-roll bars (also called 'anti-sway bar'), defines how much the vehicle will roll. This has other effects too, such as dynamic load transfer.

  wheels move relative to each other, the bar is subjected to torsion and forced to twist. Each end of the bar is connected to an end link through a flexible joint. The sway bar end link connects in turn to a spot near a wheel or axle, transferring forces from a heavily loaded axle to the opposite side. Forces are therefore transferred: The bar resists the torsion through its stiffness. The stiffness of an anti-roll bar is proportional to the stiffness of the material, the fourth power of its radius, and the inverse of the length of the lever arms (i.e., the shorter the lever arm, the stiffer the

  CURVE SYSTEM. Range Rover Sport introduced Dynamic Response active anti-roll bars. Mercedes-Benz S-Class Active Body Control system uses another approach: the computer uses sensors to detect lateral load, lateral force, and height difference in the suspension strut, then uses hydraulic pressure to raise or lower the spring to counter roll. This system removes the anti-roll bar. Most active roll control systems allow a small degree of roll to give a more natural feel. Toyota also uses a mechanical system called Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that essentially disengages the stabilizer bars when off-road, allowing for greater vehicle articulation and ride quality.

  The XJ uses a leaf spring rear suspension. Each leaf pack contains four leaf springs with a fixed eye at the front of the spring and a compression-style shackle at the rear of the spring. Two gas-charged shock absorbers are also used, along with a mild anti-sway/anti-roll bar. The suspension used on vehicles with the optional UpCountry package did not employ the rear anti-sway/anti-roll bar and provided one inch of lift over the standard suspension.

  Merivale's principal work was A History of the Romans under the Empire in eight volumes, which came out between 1850 and 1862. It was intended to fill the gaps between the focus of the works by Mommsen and Gibbon. He condensed his treatment and expanded his scope ten years later to complete A General History of Rome from the Foundation of the City to the Fall of Augustulus (1875). He wrote several smaller historical works and published sermons, lectures, and Latin verses. His rendering of John Keats's Hyperion into Latin verse (1862) received high praise.

It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary; like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the Res Gestae into question.

  Granius compiled a "novel" narrative epitome of Roman history, drawing mainly on Livy and Sallust, that ran to at least 36 books, "keen on anecdotes and curious details." That he had his own views on historiography should not be doubted: in his opinion, Sallust ought not to be read as an historian at all, but as an orator. Granius covered the history of Rome from the early times at least to the death of Julius Caesar; the assumption of this as an end-point of his history has sometimes caused him to be identified with Granius Flaccus and his life to be dated to the 1st century BC. Though riddled with lacunae, Granius's Book 35 presents

  While living in Rome in the 380s, Ammianus wrote a Latin history of the Roman empire from the accession of Nerva (96) to the death of Valens at the Battle of Adrianople (378), in effect writing a continuation of the history of Tacitus. He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the Serapeum in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into barricading themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple. The Res Gestae (Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI) was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost. The surviving eighteen books cover

  The History of Rome (Römische Geschichte) is a multi-volume history of ancient Rome written by Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903). Originally published by Reimer & Hirzel, Leipzig, as three volumes during 1854–1856, the work dealt with the Roman Republic. A subsequent book was issued which concerned the provinces of the Roman Empire. Recently published was a further book on the Empire, reconstructed from lecture notes. The initial three volumes won widespread acclaim upon publication; indeed, "The Roman History made Mommsen famous in a day." Still read and qualifiedly cited, it is the prolific Mommsen's most well-known work. The work was specifically cited when Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize.

   A planned fourth volume covering Roman history under the Empire was delayed pending Mommsen's completion of a then 15-volume work on Roman inscriptions. This task required his services as researcher, writer, and editor, which occupied Mommsen for many years. After repeated delays the projected fourth volume was eventually abandoned, or at least not published; an early manuscript may have been lost in a fire. Despite lacking a "fourth volume", in 1885 Mommsen had ready another volume on ancient Roman history; it described the imperial provinces. In Germany this work was published as volume five of his Römische Geschichte. In thirteen chapters Mommsen discusses the different provinces of the Roman Empire, each as a stand-alone subject. Here there was no running narrative of political events, often dramatic,

In 1838 he had edited Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and in the following year published his Life of Gibbon. Milman was also responsible for an edition of Horace, and when he died he had almost finished a history of St Paul's Cathedral, which was completed and published by his son, A. Milman (London, 1868), who also collected and published in 1879 a volume of his essays and articles. Milman wrote the hymn, Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!, often sung on Palm Sunday.

  Originally the History was conceived as a five volume work, spanning Roman history from its inception to the emperor Diocletian (284–305). The first three volumes, which covered the origin of Rome through the fall of the Republic, ending with the reforms of Julius Caesar, were published in 1854, 1855, and 1856, as the Römische Geschichte. These three volumes did indeed become popular, very popular. "Their success was immediate." Here "a professional scholar" presented his readers with a prose that was of "such vigor and life, such grasp of detail combined with such vision, such self-confident mastery of a vast field of learning." Especially in Mommsen's third volume, as the narrative told of how the political crisis in the Roman Republic came to its final climax, "he wrote with a fire of imagination and emotion almost unknown in a professional history. Here was scientific learning with the stylistic vigor of a novel." These first three volumes of the Römische Geschichte retained their popularity in Germany, with eight editions being published in Mommsen's lifetime. Following his death in 1903, an additional eight German editions have issued.

  The original Fred Koch Brewery was a small, independent brewery in Dunkirk, New York that produced beer and ale from late 1888 until 1985. Production peaked in the early 1950s with over 100,000 barrels brewed annually. When the Dunkirk, New York brewery was closed in 1985, it was located at 15-25 West Courtney Street. The Genesee Brewing Company currently owns the trademark rights to the name Fred Koch Brewery, but it is not producing any products under the Koch's name. Note added 9/1/18: A non-alcoholic beer "Penn's Best" is currently available and is labeled Fred Koch Brewing Co, Rochester NY. The brewery was not connected to Jim Koch of Samuel Adams fame.

  By the early 1990s, production of most of the Fred Koch brands had been discontinued. But in response to distributor and consumer interest, the Genesee Brewing Company expanded distribution of Koch's Golden Anniversary beer and introduced Koch's Golden Anniversary Light. In November 1994, to capitalize on the "ice" beer craze, Koch's Golden Anniversary Ice Beer was released. In the mid-1990s, a portion of the original Fred Koch Brewery on West Courtney St. in Dunkirk, New York was demolished. In the 2000s, Koch's Golden Anniversary Beer (plus Light and Ice) were the only products made by the Genesee Brewing Company under the "Fred Koch Brewery" name. They were all low-cost, value sector beers.

And Black Horse Ale won a gold medal at the 1988 Great American Beer Festival. As earnings continued to fall in the face of industry consolidation, Genesee began looking for new ways to cut costs. The brewery located in Dunkirk was closed and all production of the Koch's brand was made in Rochester, NY. In 1988, the former Fred Koch Brewery buildings on West Courtney Street in Dunkirk, New York were converted from a brewery to an incubator for nurturing new businesses.

  The Aqueduct Spring Brewery, the first brewery located in Rochester, New York, opened in 1819 and closed in 1844. In 1857, Rau & Reisky Brewery, later changed to Reisky & Spies, was established. In 1878, Reisky & Spies was purchased and renamed as the Genesee Brewery. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the company was reopened as the Genesee Brewing Company. In 1936, the Genesee Brewing Company acquired the old Parsons Malt House in Sodus Point, spending nearly $200,000 on renovations that were completed in 1938. At the time, it was the only malt house privately owned by an eastern brewery, and was notable for employing the traditional European floor system for malting barley. Barley would be stored at the grain elevator in Oswego, then sent to Sodus Point for malting. The malt house ended its operations in 1986. In December 1984, it purchased the Fred Koch Brewery of Dunkirk, New York. At the time The Fred Koch Brewery was owned by Vaux Breweries of Sunderland, England. In the previous year Koch sold about 55,000 barrels of beer, compared with Genesee's 3.2 million. Genesee transferred the brewing of Koch's brands to Rochester which it continued through the 2000s.

  Miller Lite was the first successful mainstream light beer in the United States market. After its first inception as "Gablinger's Diet Beer", developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller.

  Portland Brewing Company was founded in 1986 by Fred Bowman, Art Larrance and Jim Goodwin; shareholder Robert Malcolm "Mac" MacTarnahan invested $25,000 and was a major backer of the company. In 1992 the brewery named a beer in his honor, MacTarnahan’s Amber Ale, which quickly became their flagship. MacTarnahan rescued the company from financial straits in 1998 by buying $3.5 million in debt in exchange for stock; as a result Portland Brewing began using MacTarnahan labeling. Portland Brewing Company merged with Saxer Brewing Company of Lake Oswego in 2000. In 2004, MacTarnahan, then 88 years old, sold the company to Pyramid Breweries of Seattle. The Portland Brewing facility was renamed MacTarnahan's Brewing Company, and continued its operation and product line. MacTarnahan died later that year. In 2008 Pyramid itself was acquired by Magic Hat Brewing Company. This was subsequently bought by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York in 2010 and by Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. in 2012. In 2013 the brewery announced it would return to the Portland Brewing Company name. On January 8th, 2021 Portland Brewing Company announced that the brewery would cease all operations.

In 1857, Rau & Reisky Brewery, later changed to Reisky & Spies, was established. In 1878, Reisky & Spies was purchased and renamed as the Genesee Brewery. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the company was reopened as the Genesee Brewing Company. In 1936, the Genesee Brewing Company acquired the old Parsons Malt House in Sodus Point, spending nearly $200,000 on renovations that were completed in 1938. At the time, it was the only malt house privately owned by an eastern brewery, and was notable for employing the traditional European floor system for malting barley. Barley would be stored at the grain elevator in Oswego, then sent to Sodus Point for malting. The malt house ended its operations in 1986. In December 1984, it purchased the Fred Koch Brewery of Dunkirk, New York. At the time The Fred Koch Brewery was owned by Vaux Breweries of Sunderland, England. In the previous year Koch sold about 55,000 barrels of beer, compared with Genesee's 3.2 million. Genesee transferred the brewing of Koch's brands to Rochester which it continued through the 2000s.

Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as "Lite" on packaging and in

It was founded by Paul Boissevain and Richard Grey, who previously worked at the same oil company in Denver, Colorado, and lost their jobs around the same time. Keweenaw was the second modern microbrewery in the Upper Peninsula, coming over three decades after the last brewery (Bosch) had closed in Houghton in 1973. Located on Shelden Street in Houghton's downtown, Keweenaw quickly became financially successful despite not serving food. In the first year after opening, the brewery brewed 400 barrels of beer and took over a storefront next door. In the following year, they brewed 1,100 barrels, and within three years of opening, they added a deck with parking options and were producing 2,000 barrels. In 2007, the brewpub expanded its production capabilities by purchasing a warehouse in South Range, Michigan, located just to the 
 4 -10.14380  Portland Brewing Company was founded in 1986 by Fred Bowman, Art Larrance and Jim Goodwin; shareholder Robert Malcolm "Mac" MacTarnahan invested $25,000 and was a major backer of the company. In 1992 the brewery named a beer in his honor, MacTarnahan’s Amber Ale, which quickly became their flagship. MacTarnahan rescued the company from financial straits in 1998 by buying $3.5 million in debt in exchange for stock; as a result Portland Brewing began using MacTarnahan labeling. Portland Brewing Company merged with Saxer Brewing Company of Lake Oswego in 2000. In 2004, MacTarnahan, then 88 years old, sold the company to Pyramid Breweries of Seattle. The Portland Brewing facility was renamed MacTarnahan's Brewing Company, and continued its operation and product line. MacTarnahan died later that year. In 2008 Pyramid itself was acquired by Magic Hat Brewing Company. This was subsequently bought by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York in 2010 and by Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. in 2012. In 2013 the brewery announced it would return to the Portland Brewing Company name. On January 8th, 2021 Portland Brewing Company announced that the brewery would cease all operations.

But in response to distributor and consumer interest, the Genesee Brewing Company expanded distribution of Koch's Golden Anniversary beer and introduced Koch's Golden Anniversary Light. In November 1994, to capitalize on the "ice" beer craze, Koch's Golden Anniversary Ice Beer was released. In the mid-1990s, a portion of the original Fred Koch Brewery on West Courtney St. in Dunkirk, New York was demolished. In the 2000s, Koch's Golden Anniversary Beer (plus Light and Ice) were the only products made by the Genesee Brewing Company under the "Fred Koch Brewery" name. They were all low-cost, value sector beers.

In the heptathlon, the long jump is the fifth of seven events, and it is a crucial part of the competition.\n\nThe long jump is a test of an athlete's power, speed, and technique. The athlete approaches the takeoff board at a full sprint, planting their foot on the board and propelling themselves forward into the jump. The athlete's goal is to jump as far as possible while maintaining control and landing safely.\n\nIn the heptathlon, the long jump is worth 700 points, making it one of the most valuable events in the competition. The athlete's score in the long jump is added to their scores in the other six events to determine their overall score and ranking in the competition.\n\nThe long jump is a challenging event, requiring both physical and mental strength. The athlete must be able to maintain their focus and concentration throughout the competition, as well as have the physical ability to jump far and land safely.\n\nIn the heptathlon, the long jump is typically held on the second day of the competition.

  The long jump at the Summer Olympics is grouped among the four track and field jumping events held at the multi-sport event. The men's long jump has been present on the Olympic athletics programme since the first Summer Olympics in 1896. The women's long jump was introduced over fifty years later in 1948 and was the second Olympic jumping event for women after the high jump, which was added in 1928. The Olympic records for the event are for men, set by Bob Beamon in 1968, and  for women, set by Jackie Joyner-Kersee in 1988. Beamon's mark is the longest-standing Olympic athletics record by a margin of twelve years and remains the only time a man has set a long jump world record at the competition. The women's world record has been broken on two occasions at

   The standing long jump, also known as the standing broad jump, is an athletics event. It was an Olympic event until 1912. It is one of three standing variants of track and field jumping events, which also include the standing high jump and standing triple jump. In performing the standing long jump, the jumper stands at a line marked on the ground with the feet slightly apart. The athlete takes off and lands using both feet, swinging the arms and bending the knees to provide forward drive. In Olympic rules, the measurement used was the longest of three tries. The jump must be repeated if the athlete

  The title of "World's Greatest Athlete" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance. Although the title "World's Greatest Athlete" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with Jim Thorpe. During the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the Decathlon (among others). Thorpe competed professionally in baseball, American football, and basketball; and competed collegiately in track and field, baseball, lacrosse, and did ballroom dancing. King Gustav V of Sweden, while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold, said: "Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world." That title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since.

  handicap professional contest was also held but the results have not been located. The handicap event returned at the 1904 Summer Olympics and the three Olympic finalists who failed to win medals comprised the top three – all of them American. Fred Englehardt won with 6.82 m, Gilbert Van Cleve was runner-up with a mark of 6.53 m, and John Hagerman took third, recording 6.53 m. The corresponding handicaps are not known. These events are no longer considered part of the official Olympic history of the long jump or the athletics programme in general. Consequently, medals from these competitions have not been assigned to nations on the all-time medal tables.

  Standing triple jump is an athletics event based on the conventional triple jump with three jumping phases, but without an approach run-up. It is one of three standing variants of track and field jumping events, along with the standing high jump and standing long jump. While it is no longer an official competitive event, it is still used as a training exercise. The first phase is a hop from a stand still, which requires the athlete to take-off from a two-footed stand, split in mid air, and land on the preferred foot. The next phase is a long stretched step, landing on the opposite foot. The last phase is the jump, where the athlete lands on both feet. The winner is the competitor who achieves the longest distance on one of the 3 or 6 attempts. Competitions in standing triple jump are not very common today, but the event was included in the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics.

  In addition to the main 1900 Olympic men's long jump, a handicap competition was held four days later. Pál Koppán of Hungary won with a mark of 7.895 m (1.60 m handicap) and John McLean of the United States came second with 7.72 m (85 cm handicap). Sources differ as to whether the third-place finisher William Percy Remington (who was fourth in the main Olympic event) or Thaddeus McClain (seventh in the Olympic long jump). Two professionals-only contests were held in 1900. Mike Sweeney of the United States won with 5.995 m. Another American, Otto Bruno Schoenfeld, was second in 5.60 m, while Frenchman Jules Bouchoux came third in 5.55 m.

Although Johar's production house and Pritam collaborated before, as a director-composer, the soundtrack was the first one. Pritam acknowledged his experience to work with Johar as easiest and instinctive because the latter would approve or reject tunes on spot. Also, he called the soundtrack as "grand" and "romantic". As per him, the film was about unrequited love, so songs depended upon the situations and characters. He avoided pure romantic melodies as the movie was intense on emotions. Lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya penned lyrics of the tunes keeping in mind the flavour of the film. Johar narrated the script and gave situations of the songs which was a standard procedure they followed. The track "Channa Mereya", "Bulleya" and the title track were the first ones to get approved by 2015. The track "Cutiepie" was recorded later. In an interview early September 2016, Pritam announced the soundtrack album release by end of September 2016, with seven tracks. The standalone numbers were mentioned as mixed bag of intense, romantic songs and fun songs.

This orchestral music contains extensive chromaticism, diminished sevenths, and augmented scales. It also features violin tremolos. Anne Morcom writes in Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema that the piece is unmelodic and "profoundly disturbing". This use of a western-style orchestra in Indian cinema influenced many later films, such as Mughal-e-Azam (1960), which features similar dissonant orchestral music to create the atmosphere at tense moments. The song "Holi Aayi Re Kanhai", sung by Shamshad Begum, and dance by Sitaradevi has been cited as a typical Hindi film song which is written for and sung by a female singer, with an emotional charge that appeals to a mass audience.

  In October 2017, Vicentini, then a student in California, saw the protests unfolding from videos and social media. He says that this experience was "surreal" and like "a double life"; that he could watch the videos and be very worried, but then leave the house and "little birds were singing; everything was nice and quiet". This difference is what made Vicentini feel "the duty" to make the short film. The film was shot in March 2018, in Los Angeles, and was originally Vicentini's thesis for his master's degree in Cinema. It was filmed over five days and is mostly in English, starring Venezuelan actor Christian McGaffney among a cast of Americans. The

['The Philadelphia Phillies, a Major League Baseball team, won their first-ever World Series championship in 1980. The team, which had been founded in 1883, had been playing for over a century without ever winning the coveted title. In 1980, however, the Phillies had a standout season, finishing with a record of 91-61 and winning the National League East division. They then went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in six games in the World Series, securing their place in baseball history. The team\'s star player, Pete Rose, was named the series MVP, and the victory was celebrated by fans throughout the city of Philadelphia. The 1980 World Series win was a long-awaited triumph for the Phillies, and it remains one of the most memorable moments in the team\'s history.\n"""', 'When did the Philadelphia Phillies win their first world series championship?']

  The average age of the players on the Phillies' roster was 32 years. They were aptly nicknamed the "Wheeze Kids," a contrast to the 1950 Phillies team whose average age of 26 years earned them the moniker "Whiz Kids." Sports writers in Philadelphia joked at the time that this older team emphasized the veteran in their home ballpark, Veterans Stadium. The Phillies were trying to win Philadelphia its second World Title of the year as the Philadelphia 76ers had won the NBA Title back in June, as well as their second championship in four seasons — having won the 1980 World Series.

He lasted six seasons (1928–33) with the Phils, who twice lost more than 100 games during his tenure. The Shotton-era Phillies included two notable teams. Playing home games in a notorious bandbox, Baker Bowl, during a lively-ball season, the 1930 edition compiled a team batting average of .315 (paced by Chuck Klein's .386 and Lefty O'Doul's .383) and scored 944 runs; but the Phillie pitching staff allowed 1,199 runs and posted a horrendous 6.71 earned run average as the team finished last, at 52–102.

  In 1995, the Braves won the National League East by 21 games, and were the only team in the division to post a winning record. However, the Mets were the only team in the league to post a winning record against the eventual champions, posting an 8-5 record with a 5-1 mark at Shea Stadium, propelled by a sweep on the final weekend of the season, helping the Mets finish the season tied for second with the Philadelphia Phillies. (Mets won the tie-breaker, having won the season series against the Phillies. ) Just a year after realignment the Braves won their first championship in Atlanta by defeating the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series. It was the franchise's first World Series victory in Atlanta and allowed the franchise to become the first ever to win a World Series in three different cities, having previously done so in Boston and Milwaukee. The Braves' dominance over the National League would continue as they would go on to win the pennant again in 1996 behind the pitching of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.

  The 1983 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1983 season. The 80th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Orioles won, four games to one. "The I-95 Series", like the World Series two years later, also took its nickname from the interstate that the teams and fans traveled on, Interstate 95 in this case. This was the last World Series that Bowie Kuhn presided over as commissioner. This is Baltimore's most recent World Series championship, and also their most recent appearance in a World Series. This was the first World Series since 1956 in which the teams did not use air travel, as Baltimore and Philadelphia are approximately 100 mi apart. It was the Phillies’ second World Series appearance in four years. It would be 10 years before they would appear in the Fall Classic again and 25 years before they would win another.

  "Last Kiss" is a song released by Wayne Cochran in 1961 on the Gala label. It failed to do well on the charts. Cochran subsequently re-recorded his song for the King label in 1963. It was later revived by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers, Pearl Jam and several international artists, including the Canadian group Wednesday, with varying degrees of success. The song was one of several teen tragedy songs from that period. The song's opening lyrics mirror the opening lyrics of Septimus Winner's "Der Deitcher's Dog".

  The idea to cover "Last Kiss" came about after vocalist Eddie Vedder found an old record of the song at the Fremont Antique Mall in Seattle, Washington. He convinced the rest of the band to try out the song and it was performed a few times on the band's 1998 tour. The band eventually recorded the song at a soundcheck at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland in September of that year and released it as a 1998 fan club Christmas single. The band spent only a couple of thousand dollars mixing the song. Bassist Jeff Ament said, "It was the most minimalist recording we've ever done."

  By Wayne Cochran, Joe Carpenter, Randall Hoyal & Bobby McGlon (1961) In the summer of 1961, four friends traveled to the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, to record a song Wayne Cochran had written, with Joe Carpenter, Randall Hoyal and Bobby McGlon, called "Last Kiss". Wayne Cochran (vocals), Joe Carpenter (guitar), Bobby Rakestraw (bass), and Jerry Reppert (drums) recorded the song for the Gala label, a small label based in Vidalia. When the labels for the 45s, Gala #117, were printed, the names of co-writers Joe Carpenter, Randall Hoyal and Bobby McGlon were left off. Cochran evidently never asked Gala to change the label, to include the other

  The song was supposedly based on the true story of Jeanette Clark and J.L. Hancock, who were both 16 years old when their car hit a tractor-trailer on a road in rural Barnesville, Georgia. The problem is that the song was recorded more than a year before the accident supposedly happened. Clark and Hancock were on a date a few days before Christmas in 1962. A local gas station attendant helping with the recovery of the bodies did not recognize his own daughter. Hancock and Clark's friend Wayne Cooper, who was riding with them, was killed instantly. Their two other friends, Jewel Emerson and Ed Shockley, survived with serious injuries. Wayne Cochran's drummer had been dating Jeannette Clark's

  to this day Cochran is the only one credited with writing "Last Kiss". Cochran would go on to re-record the song for release on Aire Records (1962), in a slightly different tempo, with some changes to the lyrics and for re-release on King Records in 1963. In all, Cochran recorded four versions of the song, the original, Gala #117, Boblo Records #101, King Records #5856, and Aire Records #150, released as "Last Kiss" b/w "Edge of the Sea", with Cochran sharing vocals with an unnamed male vocalist. The Aire disc was easily the most different version of all, with heavy reverb and a staccato drumbeat. Aire Records, located in

  at the time of the wreck. The song was written by Wayne Cochran, who lived on Route 1941 in Georgia, about 15 miles from the crash site. It was a busy road, and Cochran witnessed many accidents on it. He was working on a song based on all the crashes he saw, and was about halfway done with "Last Kiss" when he heard about the wreck in Barnesville. There was an intense emotional response from the community after the tragedy, and Cochran used those feelings to finish the song, which he dedicated to Jeanette Clark.

The songwriter who could easily be considered America’s unofficial poet laureate has a new album in which he revisits past composition with new recordings and new interpretations. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity.
Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s.
For his new album, entitled In the Blue Light, Simon has chosen 10 songs from his past that he felt needed to be update with new arrangements, harmonic structures, lyrics and various other alterations. The songs featured on the album are not from his large collection of Top 40 hits, but are instead album tracks that have filled out his unique ability to cleverly tell stories that have made him one of the most important songwriters of the past 50 years.
In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres.
In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem.
She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney.
Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law.
In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career.
The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences.
The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company.
Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s.
Andy Platts and Shawn Lee of Young Gun Silver Fox.
The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era.
They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago.
On the new episode of ‘Documenting Popular Music,’ journalist Robert Neil speaks with Platts and Lee from their studio in London about the new album and the retro sound that is starting to get a good deal of attention.
In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries.
These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career.
On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

The problem is that the song was recorded more than a year before the accident supposedly happened. Clark and Hancock were on a date a few days before Christmas in 1962. A local gas station attendant helping with the recovery of the bodies did not recognize his own daughter. Hancock and Clark's friend Wayne Cooper, who was riding with them, was killed instantly. Their two other friends, Jewel Emerson and Ed Shockley, survived with serious injuries. Wayne Cochran's drummer had been dating Jeannette Clark's

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career.

In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album.

  Captain America's shield is a recurring item throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Like its comic book counterpart, it is circular, relatively lightweight, and made of the nearly indestructible Wakandan metal, vibranium. It is created by Howard Stark and given to Steve Rogers during World War II. Within the MCU, the shield is seen as a symbol of Captain America's strength and legacy.

It was then painted to become Captain America's symbol. MacLain would later attempt to recreate the shield's metal to no avail, his experiments instead eventually yielding the super-metal adamantium. Rogers' indestructible shield is more durable than regular adamantium and is arguably the most indestructible object in the Marvel Universe. The vibranium grants the shield unusual properties, allowing it to absorb all of the kinetic impact and vibrations from any blows that the shield

  In his debut, Captain America (secretly U.S. Army Private Steve Rogers) is equipped with a heater-style shield made from steel. After complaints by rival comic-book publisher MLJ that the design was too similar to that of its own patriotic hero the Shield, Timely Comics replaced the triangular shield with a disc-shaped one. While the origin and fate of the original shield were not described in the original comics from the 1940s, the shield's fate was revealed decades later in 2001 through a retconned story.

  Captain America's shield is a fictional weapon appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by Captain America, and has become emblematic as an American symbol in its own right. Over the years, Captain America has used several shields of varying composition and design. His original heater shield first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics. The circular shield best associated with the character debuted in the next issue, Captain America Comics #2. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America's shield appears in the live-action films: Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The shield also appears in the live-action series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021).

  #3 (May 1941). The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol. When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel, or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix. Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease. Much like his Vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.

   The round shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in Captain America Comics #2 (April 1941). An indestructible concavo-convex metal disc approximately 2.5 ft in diameter, weighing 12 lb, it has remained Captain America's most constant shield over the decades. In Captain America #255 (March 1981), it is established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The shield is created by fictional American metallurgist Myron MacLain, who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort. MacLain experiments with vibranium. During one of his

  In 2010, the history of the original shield was revised. In the limited series Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, Captain America, Sergeant Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos meet Azzari (grandfather of T'Challa)—the Black Panther and king of Wakanda during World War II. Aided by Wakandan military forces, they repel a series of Nazi attacks led by the Red Skull and Baron Strucker. During the battle, the Red Skull (wearing a battle-suit) crushes the triangular shield, and Captain America uses a circular vibranium shield provided by T'Chaka to incapacitate the Skull. The weapon serves as the inspiration for the circular shield that the super-soldier begins using upon his return to America, and the encounter marks the beginning of friendly relations between the United States and Wakanda.

  War II, Steve Rogers uses an ornamental version of the triangular shield during a musical tour with the USO promoting war bonds, which he then uses in his first combat mission and is rendered useless after Red Skull punches a large dent in it. He later notices an unadorned circular shield among Howard Stark's proposed weapons, which Stark says is made of a rare metal called Vibranium that is much stronger and one-third lighter than steel. Although Stark says it is a prototype, Rogers decides to use it after it stops .45 caliber bullets shot at it by Peggy Carter. It

  vibration-absorption properties and found only in Wakanda and the Savage Land. The vibranium was used to make Captain America's circular shield, and his triangular one was retired. Captain America received a second triangular shield that he used until given his disc-shaped shield, presented to him by President Franklin Roosevelt. This second triangular shield was kept in storage with Rogers' other personal effects after the war. It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers #4, and was kept at Avengers Mansion. It was destroyed by the supervillain Mr. Hyde during a raid on the mansion by Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil,

  Captain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions. While cosmic, magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield has absorbed Hulk's blows, repelled Thor's mystical hammer Mjölnir and deflected Wolverine's adamantium blades without visible damage. It is composed of proto-adamantium, a never-duplicated combination of vibranium, steel alloy (adamantium), and an unknown catalyst. This material absorbs kinetic energy, transferring very little and thus preventing Captain America from feeling recoil or transferred impact forces when blocking attacks. The shield can bounce off of most surfaces, ricocheting multiple times before returning to the thrower.

  Mido joined West Ham United on a four-month loan on 1 February 2010 after his season-long loan spell with Zamalek was terminated by mutual agreement. He stated "I had to sacrifice some things but I'm here to play football again and I'm here to prove a point. I'm very happy to be here, it's a great club – and I'm sure I'll do well here." West Ham chairman David Sullivan announced that in order for Mido to secure his long-term footballing future, his contract with West Ham put him amongst the lowest earners in the Premier League. Sullivan said "He doesn't want to be known as a 'has been' of English football, so he was willing to come here to play for a nominal fee, just £1,000 a week." He made his debut for West Ham on 6 February in 2–1 away defeat against Burnley. In nine appearances for West Ham he failed to score and had a tame penalty saved in a 2–2 away draw against Everton. In June 2010, West Ham decided not to offer him a new contract.

  British rock group Cream reworked "I'm So Glad" using an electric blues rock arrangement. In September 1966, they recorded it for their debut album, Fresh Cream. The song was a feature of their live performances and a recording from October 1968 is included on the album Goodbye (1969). An album review included: "it's the rampaging 'I'm So Glad' that illustrates how far they've come; compare it to the original studio version on Fresh Cream and it's easy to see just how much further they're stretching their improvisation." As a result of Cream's albums and performances, "I'm So Glad" gained a much wider audience and other artists often based their versions on Cream's. Skip James was pleased with the new interpretation of his song and remarked: "That piece is absolutely gonna stand." Deep Purple added an intro and titled the song "Prelude: Happiness/I'm So Glad" for their first album Shades of Deep Purple (1968); "Jon Lord's organ flourishes, weaving classical riffs, and unexpected arabesques into "I'm So Glad," which sounds rather majestic here", according to AllMusic's Bruce Eder.

NBC's comedy/game show Jackpot Bowling and ABC's more serious Make That Spare! were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout. Professional bowlers competed for prizes on these shows and the shows were typically considered sporting programs rather than game shows; Jackpot Bowling was reformatted as a comedy show with Milton Berle as host to shift that show's emphasis in 1960.

  the game is to get to the end of the money trail and build the most debt. Each turn, players make an investment decision which can cause their bank to gain or lose assets based on die rolls. The game winner is the bank with the largest amount of debt, who wins the "Bailout". The game also includes various trivia questions. Players must identify quotes from presidents and financial institution leaders. Answering a trivia question correctly will increase the debt of bank that the player is playing for. "Bailout!" debuted at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair in November 2009. The game is sold for $29.95. Seventeen drafts of the game were created prior to the final released version.

  A series of six questions are asked and the first player to buzz in has a chance to answer. In the first series, more questions were often asked. A correct answer adds five points to the contestant's score, but an incorrect answer deducts five points from the score. It is possible for contestants to receive minus points if they get a question wrong on 0 points. After the questions, the contestant with the highest score is offered $2,000 of "safe money". The contestant is given five seconds to decide whether to take the money, which will drop their score down to the same as the contestant with the second highest score, or decline it. If two contestants are tied for the lead, the first contestant to buzz in during the five seconds wins the money and drops back to the other contestant with the second highest score. If no contestant buzzes in during that five seconds, no safe money is given out. If all three contestants have the same score, no safe money is offered.

  '''Bailout! The Game''' is a board game created in 2008 by Jordy and Shari Sopourn. The Sopourns, a married couple living in South Florida, were trying to explain the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)—better known as the government bailout—to their three home-schooled children. Due to the children's young age (the oldest was ten), they had trouble understanding the concept, so their parents turned it into a board game. According to Jordy, the game "took on a life of its own" and the couple decided to self-publish the game. The tagline of the game is, "When you lose, you WIN!" Each player chooses a bank to play (examples: "Bankruptcy O’ America", "Worth Farless"), and starts with $2.5 billion. The objective

  In 1958, ITV pulled its version of Twenty-One almost immediately after contestant Stanley Armstrong claimed that he had been given "definite leads" to the answers. In 1960, this resulted in the Independent Television Authority's placement of a permanent winnings cap for ITV game shows of £1,000, which the Independent Broadcasting Authority increased to £6,000 in 1981 (though the British version of The $64,000 Question did receive special permission to offer £6,400 when it premiered in 1990).

  Three contestants compete in each show. They are offered a choice of 12 categories, and in each category, an expert (either a celebrity from a Channel 4 show or just a field expert) asks them a question, the answer of which it is thought people 'should know'. There is no prize money awarded for answering this question correctly, but the contestant can then answer a (harder) related cash question for money. Wrong answers lock a contestant out of the game, and the question is open to 'steals'. In round one, correct answers to the cash question are worth £100. In round two, with fewer categories left to choose from, correct answers are worth £300, whilst in round three they are worth £601. The categories include: Film, Geography, Music, Celebrity, Sport, Art, Food & Drink, History, Television, Human Body, Science, Nature, Maths, Politics, Animals and Mystery. (The Mystery category is the only category that appears on every show.)

  Truth or Consequences started out as a radio game show that premiered on NBC Radio in March 1940, and aired for 38 years on radio and television. After a preposterously difficult trivia question was asked, and Beulah the Buzzer went off when contestants inevitably failed to answer, they were asked to perform often ridiculous stunts for prizes of cash or merchandise. From the start contestants preferred to miss the question, with Edwards commenting "Most of the American people are darned good sports." After years of experimental broadcasts, the Federal Communications Commission approved commercial television broadcasts starting on July 1, 1941, and NBC's New York station WNBT (now WNBC) was the first to make the changeover, with Edwards hosting a one-time episode of the show over WNBT to commemorate the first day of commercial telecasting.

['The term "Venus Column" is used to describe a sculpted female figure serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar. This type of column is often used in classical and neoclassical architecture, and is particularly popular in the Baroque period. The figure is typically depicted as the Roman goddess Venus, or Aphrodite in Greek mythology, and is often adorned with intricate details and decorative elements. The Venus Column is a popular choice for outdoor sculptures, as it provides both structural support and a visually striking element to the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe origins of the Venus Column can be traced back to ancient Greece, where the goddess Aphrodite was often depicted in the form of a column or a pillar. This tradition continued in the Roman Empire, where the goddess Venus became a popular subject for sculptors and architects. The Venus Column became particularly popular during the Baroque period, when it was used to create grand and ornate outdoor sculptures.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a Venus Column can be found in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy. This sculpture, known as "Rape of the Sabine Women," depicts a scene from Roman mythology in which the goddess Venus is shown as a column, supporting the weight of a woman being abducted by a Roman', 'What is the name given to a sculpted female figure serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar?']

  Upper Palaeolithic female figurines are collectively described as "Venus figurines" in reference to the Roman goddess of beauty Venus. The name was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the Marquis de Vibraye, who discovered an ivory figurine and named it La Vénus impudique or Venus Impudica ("immodest Venus"). The Marquis then contrasted the ivory figurine to the Aphrodite Of Knidos, a Greco-Roman sculpture depicting Venus covering her naked body with both her hands. In the early 20th century, the general belief among scholars was that the figurines represent an ancient ideal of beauty. Since their discovery, considerable diversity in opinion

   The majority of Venus figurines are depictions of women, and follow artistic conventions of the times. Most of the figurines display the same body shape with the widest point at the abdomen and the female reproductive organs exaggerated. Oftentimes other details, such as the head and limbs, are neglected or absent which leads the figure to be abstracted to the point of simplicity. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no indication of pregnancy. The Venus of Willendorf and the Venus of Laussel (a rock relief rather than a figurine) bear traces of having been externally covered in red ochre. The significance

  A Venus figurine is any Upper Palaeolithic statuette portraying a woman, usually carved in the round. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, and distributed across much of Eurasia. Most date from the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago). However, findings are not limited to this period; for example, the Venus of Hohle Fels dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian era, and the Venus of Monruz dates back about 11,000 years to the Magdalenian. Such figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known to historians. In total, over 200 such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between about 3 and 40 cm in

  Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age inhabitants likely connected women as creators innately tied to the cycles of nature. Through this, it was believed that women's birth and menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides. One interpretation came from McCoid and McDermott who suggested that because of the way these figures are depicted, such as the large breasts and lack of feet and faces, these statues were made by women looking at their own bodies. They suggest that women during the period would not have had access to mirrors to maintain accurate proportions. This theory also provides an explanation as to why many of the Venus figures do not

  The temple originally sat up against the saddle that joined the Capitoline Hill to the Quirinal Hill. The temple was built of brick faced with marble and had eight columns (octastyle) on the facade, and also eight columns on each side. The columns were spaced one and a half diameters apart (pycnostyle). The ceiling of the temple was vaulted. There were some nontraditional elements in the design of the temple such as the height of the podium it sat upon and the method of accessing it. "Access to the cella was afforded by circulation through the flanking arches, up narrow stairs on either side, to a landing in front of the temple, from which several more steps extending the width of the facade conducted to the cella level."It was placed at the far end of the court enclosed by the Forum, a standard practice among the Romans.

Some statues show Aphrodite crouching naked; others show her wringing water out of her hair as she rises from the sea. Another common type of statue is known as Aphrodite Kallipygos, the name of which is Greek for "Aphrodite of the Beautiful Buttocks"; this type of sculpture shows Aphrodite lifting her peplos to display her buttocks to the viewer while looking back at them from over her shoulder. The ancient Romans produced massive numbers of copies of Greek sculptures of Aphrodite and more sculptures of Aphrodite have survived from antiquity than of any other deity.

  The Venus de Milo (Αφροδίτη της Μήλου) is an ancient Greek sculpture from the Hellenistic period, depicting a Greek goddess. It is one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture. The Venus de Milo has been prominently displayed at the Louvre Museum in Paris since shortly after the statue was rediscovered on the island of Milos, Greece in 1820. Sculpted sometime between 150 and 125 BC, the work was originally attributed to the sculptor Praxiteles, but, based upon an inscription on its plinth, the statue is now widely agreed to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch. The statue is believed to depict Venus, the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite. Some scholars theorize that the statue actually represents the sea-goddess Amphitrite, who was venerated on Milos. Made of Parian marble, the statue is slightly larger than life size, standing 204 cm high. The statue is missing both arms, with part of one arm, as well as the original plinth, being lost after the statue's rediscovery. The sculpture is sometimes called the Aphrodite de Milos, due to the imprecision of naming the Greek sculpture after the Roman deity Venus.

Most scholars that have differing opinions on the purpose of the figurines, such as anthropologist Randall White, also disapprove of the "Venus" name as a result. The use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the ancient figurines and the Roman goddess Venus; although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. This perception is said to have derived from the fact that attention is directed to certain features common to most of the figurines. In particular, emotionally

['In criminal cases, the issue of insanity is often raised as a defense. The question of whether a defendant was legally insane at the time of the crime is a complex one that involves a thorough analysis of the defendant\'s mental state and the circumstances surrounding the crime. Ultimately, it is up to the court to determine whether the defendant was legally insane at the time of the crime.\n\nTo make this determination, the court will typically rely on the testimony of mental health professionals who have evaluated the defendant. These professionals will provide an expert opinion on the defendant\'s mental state at the time of the crime, based on their evaluation and any relevant medical records.\n\nIn addition to the testimony of mental health professionals, the court will also consider other evidence, such as the defendant\'s behavior leading up to and during the crime, as well as any statements made by the defendant at the time of the crime.\n\nThe court will also consider any relevant legal standards, such as the "M\'Naghten" standard, which requires that the defendant did not know what they were doing was wrong or did not understand the nature and quality of the act they were committing.\n\nUltimately, the court will make a determination based on the totality of the evidence presented. If the court finds that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the crime, they may be found not guilty by reason of insan', 'who determines whether a defendant was legally insane']

  Historically, those persons acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity (insanity acquittees) were subjected to commitment procedures to institutions for the "criminally insane" with little attention or oversight provided as to what these procedures were. In the early 1970s, the procedures began to be examined legally on constitutional as well as therapeutic grounds. At that time, U.S. state jurisdictions had varying criteria and procedures governing this situation. In some states, insanity acquittees were governed by the same rules and procedures as an individual facing civil commitment. Another group of states, although treating insanity acquittees in a generally similar fashion as the civilly committed, had more stringent criteria governing insanity acquittees; for example, in emergency commitment proceedings in which a civilly committed person may be committed for a maximum of one week, an insanity acquittee may be committed on an emergency basis for 90 days—and then the discharge would take place only after judicial approval. A third group subjected an insanity acquittee to automatic, indefinite commitment, usually with periodic reviews to determine if commitment continued to be necessary.

  Under the M'Naghten rules for the insanity defense, the defendant must be not only mentally ill ("suffering from a mental disease or defect" is a typical formulation) but also unable to tell right from wrong. If the defendant runs away from the crime scene, there must thus be an awareness that the crime is wrong and so a jury would, under such factual circumstances, deny that defense. Clark v. Arizona ruled that the defense is not a right and that its scope is limited by whether the defendant knew right from wrong.

  of the evidence, comports with due process. Addington v. Texas (1979) held that the government, in a civil commitment proceeding, must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is mentally ill and dangerous. However, the concerns critical to that decision—based on the risk of error that a person might be committed for mere 'idiosyncratic behavior'—are diminished or absent in the case of insanity acquitees, and do not require the same standard of proof in both cases. Proof that the acquittee committed a criminal act as a result of mental illness eliminates the risk that he is being committed for mere idiosyncratic behavior."

  The Supreme Court examined two issues. The first was whether there was a constitutional basis for the practice in most states, and the District of Columbia, of automatically committing insanity acquitees. The court found that there was. Justice Powell, writing for the court, said that Jones' verdict established that he committed the crime and that he did so because he was mentally ill by a preponderance of evidence. "Congress has determined that a criminal defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia should be committed indefinitely to a mental institution for treatment and the protection of society."

 The criminal responsibility of the insane is commonly defined using a standard known as McNaughton's rule. This rule, which originated from a famous legal case in the early 19th century, provides criteria to determine whether an individual can be held criminally responsible for their actions based on their mental state at the time of the offense.

According to McNaughton's rule, a person is legally insane and not criminally responsible if, at the time of the crime, they were suffering from a mental disorder or defect that caused them to either not understand the nature and quality of their actions or not understand that their actions were morally wrong.

To evaluate a defendant's mental state, the court usually relies on expert testimony from psychiatrists or psychologists, who assess the individual's mental capacity and provide insights into their understanding of the crime committed. The court will consider factors such as the presence of a mental illness, the defendant's ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions, and their ability to differentiate right from wrong.

It is important to note that while McNaughton's rule is widely accepted in many countries, different jurisdictions may have variations in their definitions of criminal responsibility for the insane. Some legal systems have adopted alternative standards that may include considerations of volitional control or a broader range of mental states.

In summary, McNaughton's rule is a commonly used standard to determine the criminal responsibility of the insane. It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. However, it is crucial to consult local laws and legal precedents to fully understand the specific criteria and variations surrounding criminal responsibility in different jurisdictions.

 The criminal responsibility exception for the insane is a legal principle that recognizes that individuals who are determined to be legally insane at the time of committing a crime may not be held fully responsible for their actions. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong.

The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. The second is the irresistible impulse test, which considers whether the individual had the ability to control their behavior and prevent themselves from committing the crime due to their mental condition.

It is important to note that the application of the criminal responsibility exception for the insane can be complex and highly dependent on legal interpretations and expert assessments of an individual's mental state at the time of the crime. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception.

In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility. The main goal is to prioritize the mental health needs of individuals while ensuring public safety.

Please keep in mind that the specific details and legal standards surrounding the criminal responsibility exception for the insane can vary across different legal systems and jurisdictions. It is crucial to consult the specific laws and regulations in your particular location to understand the context and application of this legal principle in your area.

 To determine legal blameworthiness or causality in cases involving a defendant with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the trier of fact must carefully consider several factors. Firstly, it is important to recognize that a diagnosis of schizophrenia does not automatically lead to a specific legal determination, such as incompetence to stand trial or insanity at the time of the criminal act. The presence of a major mental disorder, like schizophrenia, is relevant to the case, but it must be proven that the defendant's mental disorder caused them to lack an appreciation of the charges, be unable to assist defense counsel, or not understand the nature, consequences, or wrongfulness of their actions.

The trier of fact, usually the jury or judge, will weigh all the evidence presented at trial to establish issues of legal blameworthiness or causality. This process involves considering the testimony of expert witnesses who rely on research, accepted psychological theories, and reliable and valid assessment techniques. They analyze the connections between the diagnosis (e.g., schizophrenia) and specific legal standards (e.g., insanity) to form a scientific basis for their reasoning.

It is important to note that the DSM-IV, a widely used diagnostic manual, acknowledges that there is an imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained in clinical diagnosis. The DSM-IV serves as a consensus within the mental health community for the classification and diagnosis of mental disorders. However, for legal purposes, additional evaluation and analysis are necessary to establish the connection between the diagnosis and legal standards.

In conclusion, determining legal blameworthiness or causality in cases involving a defendant with a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires careful evaluation of the defendant's mental state and the impact of their mental disorder on their understanding and actions. The trier of fact considers all evidence presented and relies on expert testimony to make informed decisions based on accepted psychological theories and reliable assessment techniques.

 For example, if someone accidentally started a forest fire by dropping a match while lighting a cigarette, this would not be arson because the defendant didn't have the required criminal intent or guilty mental state.In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result.Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act.Violence is another focus of treatment with psychopaths; violent behavior can be managed with administrative disciplinary procedures within the correctional facility. Medication may be helpful. Specific treatment goals should be set up collaboratively with the patient so that expectations and treatment parameters are clear. "So I've got a mental problem called antisocial personality? If I've got a problem, why wouldn't I be insane?" Eddie asked hopefully. By now he realized that he was not going to escape a prison term for rape, and the insanity defense was sounding more and more appealing. Dr. Huber explained that just having a mental disorder was not enough to meet the legal criteria for insanity. "In order to be legally insane, you have to have some connection between the mental disorder and the crime," he said. "There must be some evidence that the mental illness affected your ability to understand what you were doing, or that what you were doing was wrong. People with antisocial personality disorder do have the ability to know when their behavior is criminal." The state has to prove two issues to convict a defendant. First, the state must prove that the defendant actually committed the crime—that he pulled the trigger or stabbed the victim. In legal language, this issue is known as the _actus reus,_ or criminal act. Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act. In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result.

 A decision handed down by the US Supreme Court in Jackson v. Indiana (1972) resulted in state statutes designed to protect the rights of criminal defendants who continue to be incompetent to stand trial by virtue of their mental illnesses.Here, the responsibility for patient care is shared between the two clinicians in accordance with the professional qualifications and limitations of their respective professions. 10.11 Criminal Issues

In contrast to the civil issues outlined above, practicing psychiatrists interact much less frequently with the criminal law system. But there are circumstances in which mental health professionals become involved with patients who are charged with criminal acts:

1. For the evaluation of a defendant's competency to stand trial and administration of concomitant pretrial treatment, if needed

2. For the evaluation of a defendant's mental condition at the time of an alleged crime and administration of concomitant treatment if the defendant pleads and is acquitted on an insanity defense. This specialized area is called forensic psychiatry. Ideally, the mental health team responsible for providing forensic evaluations and services is composed of a psychiatrist; clinical psychologist; social worker; psychiatric nurse practitioner; and/or other personnel who are active in the patient's evaluation and treatment. 10.11.1 Competency to Stand Trial

Competency to stand trial refers to a defendant's mental condition at the time of the trial. Mental health professionals determine whether the defendant is competent by assessing the following in the defendant:

  * Ability to assist the attorney with defense
  * Understanding of the nature and consequences of the charge against him or her
  * Understanding of courtroom procedures. A decision handed down by the US Supreme Court in Jackson v. Indiana (1972) resulted in state statutes designed to protect the rights of criminal defendants who continue to be incompetent to stand trial by virtue of their mental illnesses.In other words, these pretrial defendants should be returned to court as soon as they are competent to stand trial, which should be the primary goal of pretrial treatment.10.11.2 Pleas of Insanity or Mental Illness

If the defendant chooses to plead an insanity defense, mental health professionals are involved in evaluating the defendant's mental condition at the time of the alleged crime.

 1 -1.00944 The criminal responsibility of the insane is commonly defined using a standard known as McNaughton's rule. This rule, which originated from a famous legal case in the early 19th century, provides criteria to determine whether an individual can be held criminally responsible for their actions based on their mental state at the time of the offense.

According to McNaughton's rule, a person is legally insane and not criminally responsible if, at the time of the crime, they were suffering from a mental disorder or defect that caused them to either not understand the nature and quality of their actions or not understand that their actions were morally wrong.

To evaluate a defendant's mental state, the court usually relies on expert testimony from psychiatrists or psychologists, who assess the individual's mental capacity and provide insights into their understanding of the crime committed. The court will consider factors such as the presence of a mental illness, the defendant's ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions, and their ability to differentiate right from wrong.

It is important to note that while McNaughton's rule is widely accepted in many countries, different jurisdictions may have variations in their definitions of criminal responsibility for the insane. Some legal systems have adopted alternative standards that may include considerations of volitional control or a broader range of mental states.

In summary, McNaughton's rule is a commonly used standard to determine the criminal responsibility of the insane. It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. However, it is crucial to consult local laws and legal precedents to fully understand the specific criteria and variations surrounding criminal responsibility in different jurisdictions.

 3 -2.56465 The criminal responsibility exception for the insane is a legal principle that recognizes that individuals who are determined to be legally insane at the time of committing a crime may not be held fully responsible for their actions. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong.

The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. The second is the irresistible impulse test, which considers whether the individual had the ability to control their behavior and prevent themselves from committing the crime due to their mental condition.

It is important to note that the application of the criminal responsibility exception for the insane can be complex and highly dependent on legal interpretations and expert assessments of an individual's mental state at the time of the crime. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception.

In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility. The main goal is to prioritize the mental health needs of individuals while ensuring public safety.

Please keep in mind that the specific details and legal standards surrounding the criminal responsibility exception for the insane can vary across different legal systems and jurisdictions. It is crucial to consult the specific laws and regulations in your particular location to understand the context and application of this legal principle in your area.
 4 -3.00134 To determine legal blameworthiness or causality in cases involving a defendant with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the trier of fact must carefully consider several factors. Firstly, it is important to recognize that a diagnosis of schizophrenia does not automatically lead to a specific legal determination, such as incompetence to stand trial or insanity at the time of the criminal act. The presence of a major mental disorder, like schizophrenia, is relevant to the case, but it must be proven that the defendant's mental disorder caused them to lack an appreciation of the charges, be unable to assist defense counsel, or not understand the nature, consequences, or wrongfulness of their actions.

The trier of fact, usually the jury or judge, will weigh all the evidence presented at trial to establish issues of legal blameworthiness or causality. This process involves considering the testimony of expert witnesses who rely on research, accepted psychological theories, and reliable and valid assessment techniques. They analyze the connections between the diagnosis (e.g., schizophrenia) and specific legal standards (e.g., insanity) to form a scientific basis for their reasoning.

It is important to note that the DSM-IV, a widely used diagnostic manual, acknowledges that there is an imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained in clinical diagnosis. The DSM-IV serves as a consensus within the mental health community for the classification and diagnosis of mental disorders. However, for legal purposes, additional evaluation and analysis are necessary to establish the connection between the diagnosis and legal standards.

In conclusion, determining legal blameworthiness or causality in cases involving a defendant with a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires careful evaluation of the defendant's mental state and the impact of their mental disorder on their understanding and actions. The trier of fact considers all evidence presented and relies on expert testimony to make informed decisions based on accepted psychological theories and reliable assessment techniques.
 5 -3.25999 For example, if someone accidentally started a forest fire by dropping a match while lighting a cigarette, this would not be arson because the defendant didn't have the required criminal intent or guilty mental state.In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result.Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act.Violence is another focus of treatment with psychopaths; violent behavior can be managed with administrative disciplinary procedures within the correctional facility. Medication may be helpful. Specific treatment goals should be set up collaboratively with the patient so that expectations and treatment parameters are clear. "So I've got a mental problem called antisocial personality? If I've got a problem, why wouldn't I be insane?" Eddie asked hopefully. By now he realized that he was not going to escape a prison term for rape, and the insanity defense was sounding more and more appealing. Dr. Huber explained that just having a mental disorder was not enough to meet the legal criteria for insanity. "In order to be legally insane, you have to have some connection between the mental disorder and the crime," he said. "There must be some evidence that the mental illness affected your ability to understand what you were doing, or that what you were doing was wrong. People with antisocial personality disorder do have the ability to know when their behavior is criminal." The state has to prove two issues to convict a defendant. First, the state must prove that the defendant actually committed the crime—that he pulled the trigger or stabbed the victim. In legal language, this issue is known as the _actus reus,_ or criminal act. Next, the state must prove that the defendant meant to commit the crime when he did the act. In other words, that the behavior was not a mere accident or unexpected result. For example, if someone accidentally started a forest fire by dropping a match while lighting a cigarette, this would not be arson because the defendant didn't have the required criminal intent or guilty mental state.Many legal defense strategies are based on the idea that the defendant wasn't in the right state of mind at the time of the crime.A defense attorney might argue that the defendant was acting in a jealous rage, under the influence of some hallucinogenic drug, or in fear for his life.These defenses are all known as mens rea defenses.The insanity defense is another type of mens rea defense.

["The majority party in the body which determines the rules of the US House and US Senate gained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections. This shift in power occurred as a result of the Democrats winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, which is the lower chamber of the US Congress. The Democrats gained 40 seats, flipping control of the House from the Republicans, who had held the majority since 2011. The shift in power is significant as it gives the Democrats control over the House's rules and agenda, which could lead to increased oversight of the Trump administration and potentially result in impeachment proceedings. The Democrats also gained control of the House committees, which have the power to investigate and hold hearings on various issues. The shift in power is expected to have a significant impact on the legislative process in the US Congress, as the Democrats are likely to push for policies that align with their platform, such as healthcare reform, infrastructure investment, and climate change legislation. The Republicans, on the other hand, are expected to focus on issues such as tax reform and trade policy. The shift in power is also expected to have an impact on the 2020 presidential election, as the Democrats will have a stronger voice in shaping the national agenda and potentially influencing the outcome of the election.", 'When did the majority party in the body which determines the rules of the US House and US Senate gain control of the House?']

  The 2018 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 6, 2018, with early voting taking place in some states in the weeks preceding that date. Voters chose representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states. Non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories were also elected. These midterm elections took place halfway through the term of Republican President Donald Trump. On Election Day, Republicans had held a House majority since January 2011. In the 2018 elections, the Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, won control of the House. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections. The 41-seat gain was the Democrats' largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats. Upon the opening of the 116th United States Congress, Pelosi was elected as Speaker of the House. Incumbent Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan chose not to run for another term. In November 2018, House Republicans elected Kevin McCarthy as House Minority Leader.

  The Democratic Party won control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections. This was their largest gain of House seats in an election since the 1974 elections, when the Democrats gained 49 House seats. Democrats won the popular vote by more than 9.7 million votes or 8.6%, the largest midterm margin for any party and the largest margin on record for a minority party. According to the Associated Press' statistical analysis, gerrymandering cost the Democrats an additional sixteen House seats from Republicans. Voter turnout in this election was 50.3%, the highest turnout in a U.S. midterm election since 1914.

  The 2010 United States elections were held on Tuesday, November 2, 2010, in the middle of Democratic President Barack Obama's first term. Republicans ended unified Democratic control of Congress and the presidency by winning a majority in the House of Representatives. Republicans gained seven seats in the Senate (including a special election held in January 2010) but failed to gain a majority in the chamber. In the House of Representatives, Republicans won a net gain of 63 seats, the largest shift in seats since the 1948 elections. In state elections, Republicans won a net gain of six gubernatorial seats and flipped control of twenty state legislative chambers, giving them a substantial advantage in the redistricting that occurred following the 2010 United States Census. The election was widely characterized as a "Republican wave" election. The heavy Democratic losses in 2010 were mainly attributed to the passing of the Affordable Care Act along with a poor economic recovery from The Great Recession and large budget deficits.

 Reducing the high cost of prescription drugs continues to be a priority focus for both the U.S. Congress and Trump administration, and ONS is closely monitoring and providing input on how key proposals could affect patient access to oncology care.
On April 8, 2018, nearly a dozen Democratic senators announced they would investigate the marketing practices of e-cigarette giant Juul along with a new deal to sell a minority stake of the company to Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Not long ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Juul—along with others in the smoking cessation community—supported efforts to use electronic tobacco mechanisms to help 60 million Americans quit smoking. However, along the way, the U.S. surgeon general and FDA discovered that youth smoking and vaping have seen a dramatic increase from the advertising, marketing, and distribution of e-cigarettes.
It’s been almost a decade since the Institute of Medicine—now the National Academies of Medicine (NAM)—released The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health report. Although many aspects of the nursing profession have been enhanced, still others are woefully lacking in change. Healthcare workplace safety incidents are still too high—up to 12 times higher than in the overall workforce—educational opportunities are still too expensive, and scope-of-practice authority is still too limiting in many states—all of which are ONS policy priorities.
The day the administration releases the president’s budget, outlining funding levels for federal departments and their respective programs, has become an annual event around the Beltway. When that document was unveiled on March 11, 2019, it arrived on Capitol Hill like a lead zeppelin. Under the proposed budget, the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) budget would see a 13% cut, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) would have its budget reduced by 15%. The dramatic cuts in domestic spending on health, education, and welfare programs were so stark that patient advocacy and provider groups released statements individually and through coalitions to respectfully—or less so—inform decision makers that efforts will begin immediately to advocate for maintained funding levels.
Although nurses are the number one trusted profession in the United States for the past 18 years in a row, they’re not necessarily the most protected sector. Hostile workforce environments and exposure to hazardous chemicals are still a part of too many nurses’ daily lives. Recently, the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee held hearings on workforce safety to better understand the what nurses and other healthcare workers endure.
Democrats control the majority of the House of Representatives, and it’s their responsibility to provide and pass a U.S. budget. As with any Congress, it’s always easier said than done. With a larger, more progressive freshman class interested in pushing more environmental, health, and welfare policy issues forward, costs will be a concern.
On January 25, 2019, President Trump announced a deal to end the longest U.S. government partial shutdown in history—35 days of closed public places and programs, furloughed or unpaid federal employees, and an apprehensive American nation. What was its impact on health policy and, more specifically, cancer care?
Rising prescription medication costs has been a major focus area for both the Trump administration and the 116th Congress. In January 2019, both the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction held public hearings on soaring drug costs. Despite constant media attention and mounting pressure from government officials, no pharmaceutical company executives chose to testify. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again.
To improve access to new cancer therapies and provide national consistency in coverage, on February 15, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposed plan of coverage with evidence development for CAR T-cell therapy. The public is invited to share comments for the next 30 days.
Efforts to curb the national opioid epidemic have taken shape in several ways, including redefined prescription guidelines. However, many insurers are now refusing to cover certain pain medications like the ones commonly prescribed to patients with cancer. For years, ONS has been meeting with congressional offices to advocate that access to prescription opioids for cancer survivors should be exempt from the strict limits assigned to other diagnoses. It’s always been a successful strategy, because ONS helps policy leaders understand that patients with cancer often struggle with issues related to severe pain management, quality of life, and end-of-life care.
The new 116th Congress has settled in, and a clearer picture of the diverse freshman class has come to light. In this case, nursing is present and accounted for among incoming congressional representatives. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) is an RN who ran on her support for health care, specifically to protect those with pre-existing conditions. She’s already a co-chair of the Congressional Nursing Caucus and has signed on to Title VIII nursing reauthorization legislation—something ONS has continually championed. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX)—the first nurse ever elected to Congress—is entering her 13th term in the chamber and continues to offer a veteran nursing presence on the hill.
Congress has settled in after the shutdown, and new members have taken their place on committees to begin the real work in Washington, DC. This week, the House and Senate convened similar panels to discuss the bipartisan goal to lower soaring drug costs for all Americans. Patients and families provided emotional testimony about lost loved ones because of pricey prescription medications that were out of reach.
After a contentious 35-day-long shutdown, President Trump announced on January 25, 2019, plans for a temporary deal to reopen the government for a three-week period while talks continue on border security and immigration. Neither party seems optimistic that compromise can happen by the February 15 deadline, and the future is still uncertain.
Since 2016, ONS has gathered hundreds of nurse advocates in the nation’s capital to speak truth to power during its annual Hill Days conference. This two-day meeting brings more than 100 oncology nurses to Washington, DC, to learn about the Society’s health policy legislative agenda and to be trained in how to educate elected officials on the priority issues most important to ONS members.
Although the Democrats have yet not formally taken control of the House of Representatives, many are primed and passionate about holding the Trump administration accountable after the November midterm elections. Through involvement in committees and as incoming chairs of powerful oversight panels, lawmakers are questioning officials about healthcare policy.
With more than 70% of Americans supporting expanded Medicare, the single-payer Medicare for All rallying cry has gained significant support among progressives and moderates alike. A recent editorial report makes the case for its adoption with strong evidence from an economic point of view. During the November 2018 midterm election campaign, many incumbent Republicans—some of whom previously voted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act—now promised to uphold sections of the law, including protections for pre-existing conditions as their most important campaign commitment.
On October 25, 2018, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) calling for a demonstration project to more closely align Medicare payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologics with international prices, which an HHS analysis showed to be 1.8 times lower on average than in the United States. The proposal is a follow-up to the president’s prescription drug blueprint and HHS request for information to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. HHS estimates a savings of $17.2 billion over five years.

  All states except Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia held elections for their state legislatures. Republicans made substantial gains in state legislatures across the nation. Twenty chambers flipped from Democratic to Republican control, giving Republicans full control of eleven state legislatures and control of one chamber in Colorado, Iowa and New York.1 Additionally, Republicans gained enough seats in the Oregon House to produce a 30-30 party split, pushing Democrats into a power-sharing agreement that resulted in the election of two "co-speakers" (one from each party) to lead the chamber. Republicans gained a total of 680 seats in state legislative races, breaking the previous record of 628 flipped seats set by Democrats in the post-Watergate elections of 1974.

  All 435 voting seats in the United States House of Representatives were up for election. Elections were held to select the delegates for the District of Columbia and four of the five U.S. territories. The only seat in the House not up for election was the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, who serves a four-year term. The Republican party won 247 seats (a net gain of 13 seats) and the Democratic Party, 188 seats. Thus, the Republicans gained their largest majority in the House since 1928. Nationwide, Republicans won the popular vote for the House of Representatives by a margin of 5.7 percent. On March 11, there was a special election for Florida's 13th congressional district, won by the Republican Party.

 1 -1.22161 Reducing the high cost of prescription drugs continues to be a priority focus for both the U.S. Congress and Trump administration, and ONS is closely monitoring and providing input on how key proposals could affect patient access to oncology care.
On April 8, 2018, nearly a dozen Democratic senators announced they would investigate the marketing practices of e-cigarette giant Juul along with a new deal to sell a minority stake of the company to Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Not long ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Juul—along with others in the smoking cessation community—supported efforts to use electronic tobacco mechanisms to help 60 million Americans quit smoking. However, along the way, the U.S. surgeon general and FDA discovered that youth smoking and vaping have seen a dramatic increase from the advertising, marketing, and distribution of e-cigarettes.
It’s been almost a decade since the Institute of Medicine—now the National Academies of Medicine (NAM)—released The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health report. Although many aspects of the nursing profession have been enhanced, still others are woefully lacking in change. Healthcare workplace safety incidents are still too high—up to 12 times higher than in the overall workforce—educational opportunities are still too expensive, and scope-of-practice authority is still too limiting in many states—all of which are ONS policy priorities.
The day the administration releases the president’s budget, outlining funding levels for federal departments and their respective programs, has become an annual event around the Beltway. When that document was unveiled on March 11, 2019, it arrived on Capitol Hill like a lead zeppelin. Under the proposed budget, the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) budget would see a 13% cut, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) would have its budget reduced by 15%. The dramatic cuts in domestic spending on health, education, and welfare programs were so stark that patient advocacy and provider groups released statements individually and through coalitions to respectfully—or less so—inform decision makers that efforts will begin immediately to advocate for maintained funding levels.
Although nurses are the number one trusted profession in the United States for the past 18 years in a row, they’re not necessarily the most protected sector. Hostile workforce environments and exposure to hazardous chemicals are still a part of too many nurses’ daily lives. Recently, the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee held hearings on workforce safety to better understand the what nurses and other healthcare workers endure.
Democrats control the majority of the House of Representatives, and it’s their responsibility to provide and pass a U.S. budget. As with any Congress, it’s always easier said than done. With a larger, more progressive freshman class interested in pushing more environmental, health, and welfare policy issues forward, costs will be a concern.
On January 25, 2019, President Trump announced a deal to end the longest U.S. government partial shutdown in history—35 days of closed public places and programs, furloughed or unpaid federal employees, and an apprehensive American nation. What was its impact on health policy and, more specifically, cancer care?
Rising prescription medication costs has been a major focus area for both the Trump administration and the 116th Congress. In January 2019, both the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction held public hearings on soaring drug costs. Despite constant media attention and mounting pressure from government officials, no pharmaceutical company executives chose to testify. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again.
To improve access to new cancer therapies and provide national consistency in coverage, on February 15, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposed plan of coverage with evidence development for CAR T-cell therapy. The public is invited to share comments for the next 30 days.
Efforts to curb the national opioid epidemic have taken shape in several ways, including redefined prescription guidelines. However, many insurers are now refusing to cover certain pain medications like the ones commonly prescribed to patients with cancer. For years, ONS has been meeting with congressional offices to advocate that access to prescription opioids for cancer survivors should be exempt from the strict limits assigned to other diagnoses. It’s always been a successful strategy, because ONS helps policy leaders understand that patients with cancer often struggle with issues related to severe pain management, quality of life, and end-of-life care.
The new 116th Congress has settled in, and a clearer picture of the diverse freshman class has come to light. In this case, nursing is present and accounted for among incoming congressional representatives. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) is an RN who ran on her support for health care, specifically to protect those with pre-existing conditions. She’s already a co-chair of the Congressional Nursing Caucus and has signed on to Title VIII nursing reauthorization legislation—something ONS has continually championed. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX)—the first nurse ever elected to Congress—is entering her 13th term in the chamber and continues to offer a veteran nursing presence on the hill.
Congress has settled in after the shutdown, and new members have taken their place on committees to begin the real work in Washington, DC. This week, the House and Senate convened similar panels to discuss the bipartisan goal to lower soaring drug costs for all Americans. Patients and families provided emotional testimony about lost loved ones because of pricey prescription medications that were out of reach.
After a contentious 35-day-long shutdown, President Trump announced on January 25, 2019, plans for a temporary deal to reopen the government for a three-week period while talks continue on border security and immigration. Neither party seems optimistic that compromise can happen by the February 15 deadline, and the future is still uncertain.

The current model, which was unveiled in 2013, is a more realistic and detailed version of the beloved turtle.\n\nThe new Testudo stands at 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide, and weighs over 200 pounds. It is made of fiberglass and resin, and is covered in a durable, weather-resistant paint. The turtle's shell is made up of 12 individual pieces, each of which is hand-painted to create a unique and intricate design.\n\nThe new Testudo also features a more detailed and accurate head, which is based on the skull of a real diamondback terrapin. The turtle's eyes are made of glass, and its mouth is capable of opening and closing.\n\nThe current model of Testudo was co-created by Harold Bell, a former University of Maryland student and the man who designed the original mascot in 1962. Bell worked closely with the university's athletic department to create a new and improved version of the beloved mascot.\n\nThe new Testudo has been a hit with fans and students alike, and has become a beloved symbol of the University of Maryland.

  Rooney was created in 2009 after the submission of more than 350 suggestions by students, alumni, faculty, staff and friends of the College. From these suggestions, officials narrowed the options to six. These officials consisted of two groups: the Mascot Team, composed of various students, administrators, and alumni, and a professional company who works with mascots and logos. Public comment was also critical in creating the mascot as the process continued. In 2017, a generous donation to the college lead to the creation of a 14-foot-tall Rooney topiary that stands in near Kerr Stadium and a student residence hall. Ever since Roanoke decided upon Rooney as the mascot in 2009, students who have portrayed the bird will wear the costume's feet at graduation to reveal their identity to other students and faculty members. Historically, Roanoke College has been known as the Maroons and officials ensured that this will not change due to Rooney's creation.

  inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.

The current mascot is named Porky III. ; Porky and Baby: The university has two costumed mascots who represent the university at public functions and encourage crowd involvement during athletic events.

  Texas A&M's official mascot is Reveille, now a purebred Rough collie. The first Reveille, a mixed breed dog, was adopted by students in 1931 after they found her on the side of the road. As of 2015, the current mascot is Reveille IX. She is considered a Cadet General, the highest-ranking member in the Corps of Cadets, and must be addressed by cadets as "Miss Reveille, ma'am." Reveille accompanies her handlers, members of the E-2 unit of the Corps of Cadets, everywhere, including classes. It is a long-held tradition that if Reveille decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet is required to sleep on the floor. In truth, however, this only applied to the early mascots who were allowed to freely roam the campus. The contemporary mascots, certainly since the 1980s and

  the university. On October 14, 2010, it was announced that students, alumni and season ticket holders at the university had picked Rebel Black Bear as their new mascot. The announcement was the result of a campus-wide vote in February and months of polling. The bear beat out two other finalists, the Rebel Land Shark and something called the "Hotty Toddy," an attempt to personify the school cheer. On October 6, 2017, Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter announced that the new university mascot would be the Landshark, beginning with the 2018–19 season. The black bear will be replaced by the Landshark, in reference to a celebratory hand symbol that players began using in 2008.

She resided in a large cage just to the south of the University Center that was topped with a geodesic dome designed by visiting professor R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily walks around the core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours.

Beginning in the 2000s, the university promoted the slogan "Fear the Turtle" as a rallying cry for school pride. The statue's nose is polished by passers-by that have rubbed it for good luck. Around finals week, students start giving offerings to Testudo in the hope of good grades. In 2013, the Testudo statue caught fire because of an ill-advised mixture of offerings and a lit candle. Local news channels reported about this event and it trended on Twitter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, campus guidelines included instructions to not rub the statue's nose unless using disinfectant wipes before and after to clean it.

  In 1932, Curley Byrd—who served as the university's football and baseball coach, athletic director, and president—proposed adopting the diamondback terrapin as a mascot. The first statue of Testudo cast in bronze was donated by the Class of 1933 and displayed on Baltimore Avenue in front of Ritchie Coliseum. However, the 300-pound sculpture was subjected to vandalism by visiting college athletic teams. One such incident occurred in 1947 when students from Johns Hopkins University stole the bronze statue and moved it to their campus. Maryland students traveled to Baltimore to retrieve it, laying siege to the house where it was hidden. Over 200 city police responded to quell the riot. In 1949, University President Byrd was awakened by a phone call from a University of Virginia fraternity requesting Testudo

  Texas A&M–Kingsville has a rich and storied sports history. From the establishment of the university as "South Texas State Teachers College" in 1925, the university embraced athletic competition. That year, the students of the school chose the "javelina" as a mascot – the only college or university in the world to do so. Often incorrectly considered a wild pig, a javelina is actually a ferocious creature that shares more in common with a coyote than a pig. Once provoked, a javelina often viciously and tenaciously fights any perceived threat, as demonstrated when the school's first president, Dr. Robert Cousins, discovered in 1929. After suffering an attack by one of the three mascots on the campus, Dr. Cousins stated that the creature stands

As of 2015, the current mascot is Reveille IX. She is considered a Cadet General, the highest-ranking member in the Corps of Cadets, and must be addressed by cadets as "Miss Reveille, ma'am." Reveille accompanies her handlers, members of the E-2 unit of the Corps of Cadets, everywhere, including classes. It is a long-held tradition that if Reveille decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet is required to sleep on the floor.

From the establishment of the university as "South Texas State Teachers College" in 1925, the university embraced athletic competition. That year, the students of the school chose the "javelina" as a mascot – the only college or university in the world to do so. Often incorrectly considered a wild pig, a javelina is actually a ferocious creature that shares more in common with a coyote than a pig. Once provoked, a javelina often viciously and tenaciously fights any perceived threat, as demonstrated when the school's first president, Dr. Robert Cousins, discovered in 1929. After suffering an attack by one of the three mascots on the campus, Dr. Cousins stated that the creature stands

Following his wife's early death he moved to Northwood Farm in the parish of Chudleigh, where he remarried to Elizabeth Laskey (1784-1850), widow of Mr Yeo, by whom he had 10 children. The eldest son of this marriage was William Francis Splatt (1811-1892), baptised in Chudleigh Church. He was educated at the well-regarded Kentisbeare School, and later worked at Chudleigh as a solicitor's clerk for Charles Langley. The second son of Samuel Bruce, Presbyterian minister and grandson of Michael Bruce, of Wood Street, Dublin, and Rose Rainey of Magherafelt, County Londonderry, he was born in Dublin on 30 July 1757. Bruce's first settlement was at Lisburn, and he was ordained on 4 November 1779 by the Bangor presbytery.

['In the city of Nanjing, where the Yongle emperor greeted the person to whom the edict was addressed, there were various types of theater performances. One of the most popular was the traditional Chinese opera, which was a combination of singing, dancing, and acrobatics. The performers wore elaborate costumes and masks, and the stories they told were often based on historical events or legends.\n\nAnother type of theater performance that was popular in Nanjing was the Peking opera, which originated in the capital city of Beijing. This type of opera was known for its intricate choreography and singing, and the performers often played multiple roles in a single performance.\n\nIn addition to these traditional forms of theater, there were also modern plays and musicals that were performed in Nanjing. These productions often tackled contemporary issues and were performed in more intimate settings, such as small theaters or community centers.\n\nOverall, the city of Nanjing offered a diverse range of theater performances, catering to a variety of tastes and interests. Whether one preferred the grandeur of traditional Chinese opera or the intimacy of a modern play, there was something for everyone in this vibrant and culturally rich city.\n"""', 'What other types of theater performance are seen in the city where the Yongle emperor greeted the person to whom the edict was addressed?']

  The Tang dynasty (618-907) was one of the most prosperous dynasties in Chinese history. During this period, people from Central Asia frequently traded with people who lived in the Tang capital Chang'an through the Silk Road. As a result, there are large amounts of preserved material cultures that are seen as evidence of interactions between these areas, such as wall paintings, sculptures, print and textiles. These remains can reflect to what extent the frequency of the interactions were. One of the most spectacular material cultures here is the Tang dynasty. The Tang dynasty can be regarded as a milestone of drastic cultural transformation in Dunhuang since it began in 619. Before the Tang Dynasty,

  People from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua or Standard Chinese. Tianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera. Tianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914–2003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also

  troupes, write, and perform theatrical pieces. Many of early modern China's stories reflected cross-dressing and living the life of a different gender for a short period of time, mainly featuring the cross-dressers as virtuous, like Mulan. Li Yu, a writer and entrepreneur, featured the gendering of bodies to be dependent upon men's desires and operated by a system of gender dimorphism, assumed by social boundaries of the time. When Li Yu created an acting troupe, as many elite males did, he had a concubine that played a male role as he believed she was "suited to male" or considered her more of the masculine gender. In modern-day Peking Opera and film, there are male to female cross dressers and vice versa for characters, especially with certain time periods.

The Auditorium, being one of these smaller buildings, catered to smaller performances.

  Living Like a Runaway is the eighth studio album from American rock-musician Lita Ford, released in June 2012. This is the first album of Ford's to be released on SPV/Steamhammer Records. "SPV gets who I am, my work, and what it takes to bring this project to life. I'm very excited to have them on my team," says Ford. The album was co-written and produced by rock guitarist Gary Hoey and represents a return to form for Lita, who drew inspiration from her "ugly divorce" from Nitro singer Jim Gillette. "Gary Hoey and I wanted to approach this record by getting back to basics," she said. "We want to strip away all the electronics and plug-ins and keep it to vocals, guitar, bass, and drums. Going back to basics is going back to what punk, metal and The Runaways was for me." She added, "[The album title] Living Like a Runaway means freedom and empowerment. To do what I want and to pursue my dreams while answering to no one."

  The album was recorded mainly in New York City, with the final two tracks being recorded in Berkeley, California to accommodate James Williamson. The album cover features a photograph of James topless, of which she stated "I don’t actually find it a particularly sexual shot in as much as you look at images of Rhianna or the way I was in the old days being flirtatious and provocative [...] Much more like an art or fashion photograph or sculpture or just a female anatomy as it is in other areas of creativity but not the music business." Some of the tracks contain autobiographical material, with "Screamin' Back Washington" a reference to James being adopted: "It's very honest. I was just imagining what it is like for any woman to … I’m thanking her for giving birth to me as opposed to having an abortion, but imagining how difficult it must be for any woman to give birth to a child and then give it away. Even if they are doing it for all the right reasons."

  Her early material was lyrically typical of dancehall and drew comparisons with Lady Saw, along with whom she was proclaimed "the top female artists in Jamaica" in 1998 by the Washington Post, but later developed beyond what she called "the same old four topics" to 'reality' themes and even lyrics critical of homophobia. Social scientist Clinton Hutton said of her: "She is very intuitively intelligent and deftly tackles relevant social issues". In a talk in 2011 at the University of the West Indies, she urged her fellow artists to be more socially responsible, and spoke out against the objectification of women in dancehall lyrics and the promotion of bigotry and violation of human rights, saying "The music that once spoke to and spread messages of peace and love, now merely judges, condemns and provokes." Her song "Still Alive" deals with discrimination against people with HIV, and it was used in a television campaign dealing with the issue.

  The song "Colonial Williamsburg" was cited for the "brilliant, cutting conceit" of conflating Williamsburg (a Brooklyn neighborhood) with Virginia's "tourist-trap village" called Colonial Williamsburg. In Newport News, Virginia, the Daily Press wrote that the song "critiques the hipster-infested neighborhood in Brooklyn by comparing it to the Peninsula's own 18th-century-style historic village," quoting McCall's lyrics: "There's a place not too far, you can travel there by car, it's a freaky live-in theme park and a town... Walk down the street and stare at the uniforms they wear and the funny way they talk and move around." "The Hymn Against the Whiskey," initially seeming to display a "puritan strain in McCall's thinking," instead resolved into a "ruminative" entreaty filled with the singer's "pain at watching a close friend" unable to overcome alcoholism. The 2010 book Music: What Happened? names the song "The Werewolf of Bretton Woods" as a 2006 favorite, citing its "enchanting, almost-too-brief electric piano riff" and "coolly sung, charismatically arranged hip-hop narration."

I had been in a kind of a fog, just struggling to gain a breakthrough with some things. It was a difficult time. Ministry is fun, but can also be a challenge. I went on to this mountain and spoke to the Lord: 'God I know you're with me, but please come closer. Let me feel you; let me know what to do.' ... He sorted me out, He gave me clarity. I went from just knowing he was with me, to being able to feel him with everything I am. – Jenn Johnson, Sharefaith Magazine Jenn Johnson went on to add that the experience birthed the song "I Can Feel You".
 3 -11.23952  The album was recorded mainly in New York City, with the final two tracks being recorded in Berkeley, California to accommodate James Williamson. The album cover features a photograph of James topless, of which she stated "I don’t actually find it a particularly sexual shot in as much as you look at images of Rhianna or the way I was in the old days being flirtatious and provocative [...] Much more like an art or fashion photograph or sculpture or just a female anatomy as it is in other areas of creativity but not the music business." Some of the tracks contain autobiographical material, with "Screamin' Back Washington" a reference to James being adopted: "It's very honest. I was just imagining what it is like for any woman to … I’m thanking her for giving birth to me as opposed to having an abortion, but imagining how difficult it must be for any woman to give birth to a child and then give it away. Even if they are doing it for all the right reasons."

Social scientist Clinton Hutton said of her: "She is very intuitively intelligent and deftly tackles relevant social issues". In a talk in 2011 at the University of the West Indies, she urged her fellow artists to be more socially responsible, and spoke out against the objectification of women in dancehall lyrics and the promotion of bigotry and violation of human rights, saying "The music that once spoke to and spread messages of peace and love, now merely judges, condemns and provokes." Her song "Still Alive" deals with discrimination against people with HIV, and it was used in a television campaign dealing with the issue.

  On September 14, 1984, Madonna performed her hit song “Like a Virgin” in a wedding dress and stage set as a wedding cake. This performance solidified Madonna's desire to break conventional female stereotypes on major television networks. This performance opened the door for Britney Spears, Christian Aguilera and many more to provoke audiences through more graphic or racy visuals.

The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differ in that the latter uses more classical instruments. The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments. Critics were not impressed with the version present in Like a Virgin, calling it "awful", while they warmed to the version present in Something to Remember. However, it was a commercial disappointment, reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was promoted by a music video shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, which portrayed Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel, and was shot in a single take.

According to Rodgers, although Like a Virgin was mainly driven by Madonna, he was instrumental in adding "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" to the track list. The song was a favorite of Madonna, so when in 1995 she released the ballad compilation album Something to Remember, she included a reworked version of "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" produced by David Reitzas. The version was released as the second single from the album in North America and the third single in Europe and Australia.

["Mary, the mother of Jesus, was born in Nazareth, a small town in the region of Galilee. Her betrothed, Joseph, was born in Bethlehem, a city in the region of Judah. Joseph's family was from the lineage of King David, and he was a descendant of the tribe of Judah. Mary and Joseph were both devout Jews who followed the laws and traditions of their faith. They were engaged to be married when Mary received the news that she was pregnant with the Son of God. Despite the challenges and obstacles they faced, Mary and Joseph remained committed to their faith and to each other, and their love and devotion to God and to each other played a significant role in the birth and life of Jesus.", "Where was Mary's betrothed born?"]

  A fundamental principle of the Christian faith is that Jesus was born of Mary, a virgin. Both Matthew and Luke trace the genealogy of Joseph back to David. According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah must be a descendant of David, but if Jesus was born of a virgin, he cannot be a descendant of David through Joseph. Michael Martin asserts that Mary's virginity is a later addition to Christianity as indicated through Paul's letters. Further, Martin notes that early Christian communities did not seem to have widely believed in the virgin birth. The confusion surrounding the virginity of Mary may result from Septuagint translation of both עַלְמָה "young girl" and בְּתוּלָה, "virgin" into παρθένος, which usually means virgin. Relying on this translation, Matthew tried to show that Jesus's virgin birth was foretold in Isaiah 7:14—which refers to an almah in Hebrew.

Wealthy and handsome Cleophas and rabbi's son Abner are both in love with Mary but she loves only Joseph, the son of a carpenter. Despite their age difference and the objections of Mary's mother, Hannah, the love between Mary and Joseph prevails, and they are betrothed. Soon after the ceremony, Mary is visited by an angel, who tells her that she will become the mother of the Messiah, whom she shall name Jesus. Mary is then faced with the responsibility of impending motherhood as well as proving to Joseph that she has not betrayed him. Meanwhile, Mary's aunt Elizabeth is also pregnant (with John the Baptist). After telling her parents and Joseph the truth, Mary's family arranges for her to come to

 The virgin birth is worthy of God. Which human birth would have been more worthy of God, than the one in which the Immaculate Son of God maintained the purity of his immaculate origin while becoming human? ; We confess that Christ the Lord was born from a virgin, and therefore we reject the natural order of things. Because she conceived not from a man but from the Holy Spirit. ; Christ is not divided but one. If we adore him as the Son of God, we do not deny his birth from the virgin. ... But nobody shall extend this to Mary. Mary was the temple of God but not God in the temple.

   In the days when Herod was king of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to announce to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, that a child would be born to her and she was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever.

   Scenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life. After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the Circumcision of Christ, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Flight into Egypt, and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin John the Baptist, sometimes with John's mother Elizabeth. Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks is a famous example. Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the Holy Kinship, popular in the Northern Renaissance.

['Nintendo\'s limit on games per developer per year on the abbreviation of the platform of Star Voyager was one. This was due to the fact that the system was not as popular as the NES, and Nintendo wanted to ensure that each game released for the system was of high quality and would not oversaturate the market. This policy was in place to maintain the value of the Star Voyager brand and to prevent the system from being seen as a "budget" alternative to the NES. However, this policy was not strictly enforced, and some developers were able to release multiple games for the system, albeit with some restrictions and limitations.', "What was Nintendo's limit on games per developer per year on the abbreviation of the platform of Star Voyager?"]

  During the market lifespan of the Famicom, Nintendo developed the Disk System, a floppy disk drive peripheral with expanded RAM which allowed players to use re-writable disk media called "disk cards" at Disk Writer kiosks. The system was relatively popular but suffered from issues of limited capacity. However, Nintendo did see a market for an economical re-writable medium due to the popularity of the Disk System. Nintendo's first dynamic flash storage subsystem for the Super Famicom is the Satellaview, a peripheral released in 1995 that facilitated the delivery of a set of unique Super Famicom games via the St.GIGA satellite network.

  The 10NES system is a lock-out system designed for the North American and European versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game console. The electronic chip serves as a digital lock which can be opened by a key in the games, designed to restrict the software that could be operated on the system. The chip was not present originally for Famicom games in 1983, but was discovered to be part of NES games after 1985 due to Nintendo's patent filings for the chip. The chip was developed as a result of the 1983 video game crash in North America, partially caused by an oversaturated market of console games due to lack of publishing control. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi said in 1986, "Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games." By requiring the presence of the 10NES in a game cartridge, Nintendo prevented third-party developers from producing games without Nintendo's approval, and provided the company with licensing fees, a practice it had already established earlier with Famicom games.

  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. It is the sequel the original Star Wars for the NES. This is the second of three video games released under the Empire Strikes Back title that were developed directly for home video game systems. It was preceded by a version for the Atari 2600 and succeeded by Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back for the Super NES. After the game was completed, the developers were occupied making Super Star Wars for the Super NES, so a corresponding NES sequel covering the film Return of the Jedi was never developed, nor released. A version of the game was released for the Game Boy. It was reprinted and distributed by several publishers over the course of three years. On July 26, 2019, the NES and Game Boy versions were officially re-released in both standard and Collector's Edition sets with Disney and Lucasfilms's approval in limited quantities on unlicensed replica game cartridges by Limited Run Games.

  China has a large black market for video games and usually only a few games officially make it to the Chinese market. Many Chinese gamers tend to purchase pirated cartridge or disc copies or download ROMs and ISOs to play via emulator. Nintendo wanted to curb the software piracy in China, and bypass the ban that the Chinese government has implemented on home game consoles since 2000. Nintendo partnered with Wei Yen, who helped Nintendo in other projects, and together they created a game system to get around China's black market, as well as loophole through the government's ban. Originally, the system would support games released on Nintendo consoles prior to the GameCube, which include the NES, Super NES and Nintendo 64, but later in the system's development, it was decided only to include Nintendo 64 games. Additionally, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask was going to be included in the software library but it was later cancelled; however, the game's promotional picture is still on the back of the box.

  By 1985, the home market console in North America had been dormant for nearly two years. Elsewhere, video games continued to be a staple of innovation and development. After seeing impressive numbers from its Famicom system in Japan, Nintendo decided to jump into the North American market by releasing the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES for short. After release it took several years to build up momentum, but despite the pessimism of critics it became a success. Nintendo is credited with reviving the home console market. One innovation that led to Nintendo's success was its ability to tell stories on an inexpensive home console; something that was more common for home computer games, but had only been seen on consoles in a limited fashion. Nintendo also took measures to prevent another crash by requiring third-party developers to adhere to regulations and standards, something that has existed on major consoles since then. One requirement was a "lock and key" system to prevent reverse engineering. It also forced third parties to pay in full for their cartridges before release, so that in case of a flop, the liability will be on the developer and not the provider.

This is an adventure game after all, so it wouldn't be right if the battles didn't also have some kind of puzzle solving element!" When asked if he was aware of the criticisms of the previous games, Tanabe replied that he could not address every fan suggestion. Instead, he challenged himself to move towards new and innovative concepts, and focus on them so a large audience can enjoy them.

It also forced third parties to pay in full for their cartridges before release, so that in case of a flop, the liability will be on the developer and not the provider. While journalists agreed an SNES Classic would be a more enticing product and Nintendo would likely be more prepared to produce a larger number of systems, Nintendo's decision with the NES Classic may have influenced consumers to be wary of trying to buy a system produced in low volumes, or give the impression of artificial scarcity with the

 to use five of their characters, including Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon, for games on Philips's console called the CD-i, after the partnership's dissolution. Contracting out to independent studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on the look of the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Ars Technica recognized that licensing issues might have limited when songs from one single game could be played in others of the series (such as the case for The Beatles: Rock Band), but that such cross-compatibility should have been a high priority for rhythm games.

 Andrew Newberg is an American neuroscientist who is a Professor in the Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences and the Director of Research at the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, previously an Adjunct Professor of Religious Studies and a Lecturer in Psychology in the Biological Basis of Behavior Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

He has been a prominent researcher in the field of nuclear medical brain imaging and neurotheology. In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of religiosity as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including clinical depression, head injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

His 2010 book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on neurotheology.

Biography
Newberg graduated from Haverford College in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in Internal Medicine with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.

Because of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he was an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind. Newberg also teaches a neuroimaging course in the Biological Basis of Behavior Program.

Academic research
In the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and religious and spiritual experiences. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “neurotheology”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences. His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study Buddhist meditators and Franciscan nuns in prayer. He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief. This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.

Literary activities
Newberg is the author of ten books (translated into 16 languages), and over 200 articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on neuroscience and religion. His book, Why God Won’t Go Away, is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. Why We Believe What We Believe, co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an atheist and individuals speaking in tongues (or glossolalia). A more recent book, How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain, also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, Words Can Change Your Brain describes how a research-based communication practice, "compassionate communication", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the Journal of Executive Education.

Media appearances
Newberg's research has been featured in Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, and the New Scientist.  He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral and appeared in the films What the Bleep Do We Know!? and Religulous. He has appeared on Dr. Oz, StarTalk with Neil deGrasse Tyson, Good Morning America, Nightline, 20/20, CNN, ABC World News Tonight, as well as in the movie Awake: The Life of Yogananda. His work has been featured in a number of major media articles including in Time, National Geographic, Discover, New York Times, Popular Mechanics, O Magazine, London Observer, Philadelphia Inquirer, and Readers Digest.

Reception

Recognition
Newberg was listed as one of the 30 Most Influential Neuroscientists Alive Today by the Online Psychology Degree Guide.

Criticism

From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.

A more recent book, How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain, also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, Words Can Change Your Brain describes how a research-based communication practice, "compassionate communication", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the Journal of Executive Education.

Media appearances
Newberg's research has been featured in Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, and the New Scientist.  He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral and appeared in the films What the Bleep Do We Know!? and Religulous. He has appeared on Dr. Oz, StarTalk with Neil deGrasse Tyson, Good Morning America, Nightline, 20/20, CNN, ABC World News Tonight, as well as in the movie Awake: The Life of Yogananda. His work has been featured in a number of major media articles including in Time, National Geographic, Discover, New York Times, Popular Mechanics, O Magazine, London Observer, Philadelphia Inquirer, and Readers Digest.

Reception

Recognition
Newberg was listed as one of the 30 Most Influential Neuroscientists Alive Today by the Online Psychology Degree Guide.

Criticism

From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.

 2 2.23131 Andrew Newberg is an American neuroscientist who is a Professor in the Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences and the Director of Research at the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, previously an Adjunct Professor of Religious Studies and a Lecturer in Psychology in the Biological Basis of Behavior Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

He has been a prominent researcher in the field of nuclear medical brain imaging and neurotheology. In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of religiosity as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including clinical depression, head injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

His 2010 book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on neurotheology.

Biography
Newberg graduated from Haverford College in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in Internal Medicine with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.

Because of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he was an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind. Newberg also teaches a neuroimaging course in the Biological Basis of Behavior Program.

Academic research
In the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and religious and spiritual experiences. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “neurotheology”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences. His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study Buddhist meditators and Franciscan nuns in prayer. He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief. This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.

Literary activities
Newberg is the author of ten books (translated into 16 languages), and over 200 articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on neuroscience and religion. His book, Why God Won’t Go Away, is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. Why We Believe What We Believe, co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an atheist and individuals speaking in tongues (or glossolalia).

['The word "Hindu" is derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means "River of Indus". The Indus Valley civilization, which flourished during 3300-1300 BCE, inhabited the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent. The people of this civilization called themselves "Sindhu" and referred to their land as "Sindhu-desa" or "Land of the Sindhu". The Persians, who invaded the region in the 6th century BCE, called the people "Hindu" and the land "Hindu-stan" or "Land of the Hindus". The word "Hindu" is also a majority religion in what became India when the country that disavowed the Taliban was created in the Arabic dictionary.\n\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization was one of the world\'s earliest urban civilizations, and it is credited with the invention of the world\'s first known writing system, the Indus script. The civilization was characterized by its urban planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and the use of standardized weights and measures. The people of this civilization were skilled in agriculture, metallurgy, and textiles, and they traded with other civilizations in the region.\n\n\nThe civilization declined in the 19th century BCE, and it was eventually absorbed by other cultures. However', 'What is the meaning of the word that is also a majority religion in what became India when the country that disavowed the Taliban was created in the Arabic dictionary?']

They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC.  The Indus Valley Civilisation (c. 3300–1700 BC, flourished 2600–1900 BC), abbreviated IVC, was an ancient civilisation that flourished in the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river valleys have been found in eastern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and western India.

  The first Urban Civilization in the Indian subcontinent is traceable originally to the Indus Valley Civilisation mainly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, now in modern-day Pakistan as well western states of the Republic of India. The earliest settlements are seen during the Neolithic period in Merhgarh, Balochistan. The civilization's cities were noted for their urban planning with baked brick buildings, elaborate drainage and water systems, and handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving). This civilisation transitioned from the Neolithic period into the Chalcolithic period and beyond with their expertise in metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). Their urban centres possibly grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation itself may have contained between one and  five million individuals.

  Indigenists claim a continuous cultural evolution of India, denying a discontinuity between the Harappan and Vedic periods, identifying the IVC with the Vedic people. According to Kak, "the Indian civilization must be viewed as an unbroken tradition that goes back to the earliest period of the Sindhu-Sarasvati (or Indus) tradition (7000 or 8000 BCE). This identification is incompatible with the archaeological, linguistic and genetic data, and rejected by mainstream scholarship.

  the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus. The word "Hindu" is much older, and it is believed that it was used as the name for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. According to Gavin Flood, "The actual term Hindu first occurs as a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu)", more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I (550–486 BCE). The term Hindu in these ancient records is a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be

  Indigenous Aryanism, also known as the Indigenous Aryans theory (IAT) and the Out of India theory (OIT), is the conviction that the Aryans are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, and that the Indo-European languages radiated out from a homeland in India into their present locations. It is a "religio-nationalistic" view on Indian history, and propagated as an alternative to the established migration model, which considers the Pontic steppe to be the area of origin of the Indo-European languages. Reflecting traditional Indian views based on the Puranic chronology, indigenists propose an older date than is generally accepted for the Vedic period, and argue that the Indus Valley Civilization was a Vedic civilization. In this view, "the Indian civilization must be viewed as an unbroken tradition that goes back to the earliest period of the Sindhu-Sarasvati (or Indus) tradition (7000 or 8000 BCE)." Support for the IAT mostly exists among a subset of Indian scholars of Hindu religion and the history and archaeology of India, and plays a significant role in Hindutva politics. It has no relevance, let alone support, in mainstream scholarship.

The Impeachment Resolution, or Articles of Impeachment, are then reported to the full House with the committee's recommendations. The House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass.

No president impeached by the House has been convicted by the Senate. In two cases, a Senate majority voted to convict an impeached president, but the vote fell short of the required two-thirds majority and therefore the impeached president was not convicted. The two instances where this happened were the Senate trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868 (where Johnson escaped conviction by one vote), and the second Senate trial of Donald Trump in 2021, where Trump missed conviction by 10 votes. The following table lists federal officials who were impeached. Blue highlight indicates presidents of the United States.

On January 31, 2020, Murkowski released a statement prior to the impeachment vote indicating her intent to vote against calling witnesses. She said the two Articles of Impeachment were "rushed and flawed." She said she did not want to put Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who was overseeing the Senate's process, into the position of breaking a tie vote. The vote failed, 51–49, with Romney and Collins supporting the calling of additional witnesses and provision of new documents. During the second impeachment of Donald Trump, and the subsequent trial in the Senate, Murkowski joined all Democrats and six Republicans in voting to convict the former president.

   Impeachment in the United States is the process by which a legislature's lower house brings charges against a civil federal officer, the vice president, or the president for misconduct alleged to have been committed. Impeachment may also occur at the state level if the state or commonwealth has provisions for it under its constitution. The federal House of Representatives can impeach a party with a simple majority of the House members present or such other criteria as the House adopts in accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment|Article One, Section 2, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution]].

["The last woolly mammoths, iconic symbols of the Ice Age, died out around 10,000 years ago, according to a new study.\n\nScientists have long debated when the woolly mammoths, which once roamed the Arctic and other icy regions, disappeared. Some researchers have suggested that the animals died out as the Earth's climate warmed at the end of the last Ice Age, around 11,700 years ago.\n\nBut a new study, published in the journal Nature, suggests that the woolly mammoths died out much later, around 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers, led by Tom Higham of the University of Virginia's Department of Environmental Sciences, analyzed the remains of 25 mammoths found in Alaska, Siberia and other locations. They used a technique called optically stimulated luminescence, which measures the amount of light emitted by crystals in sediment, to determine when the animals died.\n\nThe results showed that the mammoths died out between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago, with the majority dying out around 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the mammoths died out due to a combination of factors, including climate change, human hunting and competition with other animals for resources.\n", 'When period did the last woolly mammoths die out?']

  Mainstream paleontologists believe that mastodons and mammoths became extinct by 4000 BCE. This suggests that a beast of burden in the Book of Mormon time period most likely would not have been a mammoth, although many Latter-day Saints still persist in displaying cureloms as mammoths in literature and media. Recent studies have found that a small population of mammoths existed until approximately 1650 BCE. These survivors were an isolated arctic population discovered on the remote Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean. This is the time period wherein Jaredites would have lived, but the geography and climate are far from matching the lands proposed by Book of Mormon scholars and apologists.

  cold glacials periodically advanced deep into Europe. Other animals like horses, steppe lions, the scimitar cat, the Ice Age spotted hyena, wolves, wild boar, red deer among others were part of both faunal assemblages. At the end of the Pleistocene however, at the end of the last glaciation, the mammoth steppe faunal-assemblage receded with the warmer temperatures, but was not replaced by the Paleoloxodon-faunal assemblage whose most prominent members, straight-tusked elephants and the two species of rhinoceros, had already gone extinct. Similarly, the mammoth steppe faunal assemblage also collapsed not long after as part of the Quaternary extinction event, although regionally small woolly mammoth populations held out well into the Holocene, and the Irish elk was present in the southern Ural region into historical times. Both has been attributed to either climate change or human impact, or a combination of the two.

   The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the "Ice Age", spanned 125,000 –14,500YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age, which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. The Ice Age reached its peak during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheets began advancing 33,000YBP and reached their maximum limits 26,500YBP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000YBP and in Antarctica approximately 14,500YBP, which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14,500YBP and the Bering land bridge was finally inundated around 11,000YBP.

In a study published in 2005, measurement of footprints from recorded mammoth trackways showed that only 30% of the animals were juveniles. Healthy herds of African elephants include 50% to 70% young animals, while lower numbers are seen in connection with stresses from poaching. The study is quoting the original radiocarbon date for the footprints at 11,000 to 11,300 years B.P., but both the original and re-examined date place the footprints in the period of human spread across North America, suggesting a correlation between human presence and local decline in herd viability.

  continents points to the extinction of large animals, termed Pleistocene megafauna, near the end of the last glaciation. During the Ice Age a vast, cold and dry mammoth steppe stretched from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared with today. Therefore, the flora and fauna of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North

  Columbian and woolly mammoths both disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna. The most recent Columbian mammoth remains have been dated around 10,900 years ago. This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists do not know whether these extinctions happened abruptly or were drawn out. During this period, 40 mammal species disappeared from North America, almost all of which weighed over 40 kg; the extinction of the mammoths cannot be explained in isolation. Scientists are divided over whether climate change, hunting, or a combination of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate-change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland, and semidesert, with less diverse

 The main factors that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoths on St. Paul Island, Alaska during the mid-Holocene period were declining freshwater resources and drier climates, coupled with shrinking island area. This is supported by multiproxy paleoenvironmental records, including sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, diatom and cladoceran assemblages, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains.

The evidence suggests that mammoths survived on St. Paul Island until approximately 5,600 ± 100 years ago, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, indicating that human factors were not the drivers of extinction.

Instead, the extinction coincided with the decline in freshwater resources and the drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 years ago. Rising sea levels and regional climate change likely caused the shrinking of the island, resulting in less available habitat for the mammoths. Additionally, the degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake further exacerbated the situation.

This extinction event on St. Paul Island highlights the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even without human influence. The combination of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity due to rising sea levels and climate change ultimately led to the extinction of the woolly mammoths in this particular location.

  they died in incidents such as a drought, or because these locations were natural traps in which individuals accumulated over time. For a few thousand years prior to their extinction, Columbian mammoths coexisted in North America with Paleoamericans – the first humans to inhabit the Americas – who hunted them for food, used their bones for making tools, and depicted them in ancient art. Columbian mammoth remains have been found in association with Clovis culture artifacts; these remains may have stemmed either from hunting or scavenging. The Columbian mammoth disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene around 11,500 years ago, most likely as a result of habitat loss caused by climate change, hunting by humans, or a combination of both.

  had been discovered but had not yet been identified as an essential amino acid for cats. Today many cats thrive on a cooked meat diet where taurine has been added after cooking. The deficient diets lacked sufficient taurine to allow the cats to properly form protein structures and resulted in the health effects observed. Pottenger himself concluded that there was likely an "as yet unidentified, heat‐labile protein factor". In 2014, Robert Davidson wrote that the "deficiencies Pottenger identified in cats correspond with those of a taurine deficiency and are the direct result of the lack of taurine in the feline diet". The ethics of Pottenger's studies have been questioned.

  The results interested Pottenger and he decided to conduct a series of feeding experiments. The experiments involved approximately 900 cats over a period of 10 years, with four generations of cats being studied. Pottenger kept records for 600 cats, but 300 were not recorded. One group of cats was fed a diet of two-thirds raw meat, one-third raw milk, and cod-liver oil while the second group was fed a diet of two-thirds cooked meat, one-third raw milk, and cod-liver oil. In 1946, Pottenger reported his results that the cats fed the raw diet were healthy while the cats fed the cooked meat diet developed various health problems. Pottenger reported that

  Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract hormones he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments. He was feeding the cats a diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply. Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Their kittens were more energetic and their post-operative death rate was

 Dietary management in canine gastrointestinal conditions is to provide a proper balance of total nutrients while meeting the special dietary needs of the patient. Dietary fats from long chain triglycerides (LCT) can be one of the most complex nutrients to digest, and fermentation of undigested fats can contribute to diarrhea. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) provide a readily digested and utilized energy source. Feeding a properly formulated diet designed to be highly digestible yet restricted in long chain triglycerides may be beneficial in the management of certain gastrointestinal conditions while meeting the nutritional needs of the animal.

  of pressure applied to the mixture forces it to enter through the die before exiting the extruder completely, where it is cut to its desired size by a rotating fly knife. Unfortunately, the extrusion process actually denatures some of nutritional elements of the food. Taurine deficiency has been found in dogs and cats fed extruded commercial diets. Not usually considered an essential nutrient for dogs, taurine is plentiful in most whole meats, whether raw or cooked, but is reduced in extruded diets. Taurine deficiency could also be due to the use of rendered, highly processed meat sources that are low in taurine. Regardless of the cause, taurine is now artificially supplemented back into the diet after processing in the production of most commercial pet food.

["The creator of the famous sculpture, Crucifixion, died in 1402 in the town of Siena, Italy. Unfortunately, the plague struck Siena in 1348, and it is estimated that over 50% of the population died from the disease. The plague returned to Siena in 1363, 1374, 1390, and 1400, with each outbreak claiming thousands of lives. However, there is no record of the plague occurring in Siena during the year of the creator's death, 1402.\n\n\nThe creator of Crucifixion, Giovanni Pisano, was a renowned sculptor and architect who lived during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. He was born in Pisa, Italy, and studied under the famous sculptor, Nicola Pisano. Giovanni's most famous work, Crucifixion, was created for the church of San Domenico in Siena. The sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by the Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist, and St. Mary Magdalene. The sculpture is considered a masterpiece of the Gothic style and is still on display in the church today.\n\n\nGiovanni's death in 14", "How many times did plague occur in the place where Crucifixion's creator died?"]

  Born in Pisa, Giovanni Pisano was the son of the famous sculptor Nicola Pisano. He received his training in the workshop of his father and in 1265–1268 he worked with his father on the pulpit in Siena Cathedral. His next major work with his father was the fountain Fontana Maggiore in Perugia (completed 1278). Nicola Pisano is thought to have died either around 1278 or in 1284 when Giovanni took up residence in Siena. These first works were made in Nicola's style and it is difficult to separate the contributions of the two artists. However the Madonna with Child can be attributed with certainty to Giovanni, showing a new style with a certain familiarity between Mother

   The plague saints are depicted on city gates, and in panel paintings and fresco cycles in works that were commissioned by religious orders, clergy and others. Saint Sebastian has been painted by many well-known Renaissance artists such as Raphael, El Greco, Holbein, Guido Reni, Piero del Pollaiolo, Mantega, Giovanni Bellini and Perugino. There were mass-produced images as well like engravings and broadsheets. Sebastian is depicted in a Florentine engraving from the 1470s that includes the text of an invocation that the purchaser is recommended to recite. A similar engraving shows the cessation of plague in Rome after Sebastian's body is recovered from the well, based on the claim from the Golden Legend that in when Italy was ravaged by plague during the 8th century it was divinely revealed

  Giovanni Pisano (c. 1250 – c. 1315) was an Italian sculptor, painter and architect, who worked in the cities of Pisa, Siena and Pistoia. He is best known for his sculpture which shows the influence of both the French Gothic and the Ancient Roman art. Henry Moore, referring to his statues for the facade of Siena Cathedral, called him "the first modern sculptor".

  Child. Giovanni's next work was at Pisa Cathedral, sculpting the statues in the two rows of traceried gables at the exterior of the Baptistry (1277–1284). The vivacity of these statues is a new confirmation that he had left the serene style of his father behind. Between 1287 and 1296 he was appointed chief architect of Siena Cathedral. The architectural design and elegant sculptures for the facade of the cathedral in Siena show his tendencies to blend Gothic art with reminders of Roman art. The work was continued after his death, with still greater Gothic elaboration, by Memmo di Filippuccio. In 1296 he returned to Pisa to begin work on the Church of San Giovanni. In 1301

Christ stands on a cloud and wears a vaporous, white loincloth, and the blood from his wounds pours into a chalice of the Eucharist. The physical type of Christ is similar to Christ in Lotto's Suardi Chapel. The Scuola di Corpo di Cristo that commissioned the series wished to represent the body of Christ as a means of redemption—Lotto had shown Christ as risen, where his cross is only a luminous sign placed on his head. Later representations of Christ with sores, the tools of his martyrdom, and his blood pouring into a chalice were made by Giovanni Bellini in 1460 and Vittore Carpaccio

  One of his pupils was Giovanni di Balduccio, who also became a famous sculptor, and the architect and sculptor Agostino da Siena. He also had an influence on the painter Pietro Lorenzetti. Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Pisano in his book Le vite dei più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architetti The asteroid 7313 Pisano was named to honour Nicola and Giovanni Pisano.

  Humility, painted between 1431 and 1437, is also an important work and illustrates Lippi's early style, when he was attentive to Masaccio's use of large and round figures. It was painted during a period when Lippi had dropped out of sight, and had perhaps gone into exile with Cosimo de' Medici. A miracle attributed to the fresco of the Madonna of Humility painted in circa 1370 gave rise to the construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of Humility in Pistoia, Tuscany, Italy. The fresco is sometimes attributed to Giovanni di Bartolomeo Cristiani, but was perhaps done by a local painter from Pistoia. The Basilica, built by architect

  During 1264 he was asked to work on the Shrine of Saint Dominic in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. He was certainly responsible for the design, but his input was probably minimal. In 1265 he was already at work on the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral. The front side was done in his workshop, partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto. It would almost take 500 years to finish this shrine through the work of famous sculptors: Arnolfo di Cambio, fra Guglielmo Agnelli, Niccolò dell'Arca, the young Michelangelo, Girolamo Coltellini and Giovanni Batista Boudard. The expressive face of saint Dominic, so different from the more blander faces in the front panel "Saint Dominic resurrects Napoleone Orsini", is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio.

  Saving Africa's Witch Children is a documentary directed by Mags Gavan and Joost van der Valk. It features Gary Foxcroft and his organisation Stepping Stones Nigeria who campaign against the branding of children as witches in Nigeria, primarily by the evangelical "Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries", headed by Helen Ukpabio. In some of the poorest parts of Nigeria, Pentecostal evangelical religious fervour is combined with the old but persistent African belief in sorcery and black magic. Thousands of children are victimised, abused, abandoned or even killed as they are blamed for having brought about disease, misfortune, death and famine by their alleged witchcraft. The film was part of Channel 4's Dispatches Series and won numerous awards, including a BAFTA and an International Emmy for Best Current Affairs.

  The Three Mothers (Italian: Le Tre madri) is a trilogy of supernatural horror films by Italian filmmaker Dario Argento. It consists of Suspiria, Inferno and Mother of Tears. Each film deals with one of the titular "Mothers", a triumvirate of ancient witches whose powerful magic allows them to manipulate world events on a global scale, killing anyone who discover their whereabouts, and who are hell-bent on world domination. During the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, Argento stated he had not ruled out the possibility of shooting a fourth film dealing with the Three Mothers. His daughter Asia has suggested that there might be a prequel.

  The story of the Three Mothers begins at the dawn of the 11th century, when three sisters created the pernicious art of witchcraft on the coast of the Black Sea. In the years that followed, they wandered the world and amassed great personal wealth and power, leaving death in their wake. Both Mater Suspiriorum and Tenebrarum have claimed that the Mothers are Death personified. In the late 19th century the women commissioned E. Varelli, an Italian architect based in London, to design and construct three stately buildings. From these enchanted, bastion-like homes the Three Mothers "rule the world". According to Varelli's memoirs, entitled The Three Mothers by an anonymous colleague, the architect learned too late of the women's evil nature. (At least six copies of the book are known to have existed. Four may have been destroyed at the end of Inferno.) The residences he designed will become so corrupted that eventually, the land they were built on will become pestilential.

  Claudio Simonetti (born 19 February 1952) is an Italian musician and film composer. He moved with his family to Italy at the age of 11. The keyboardist of the progressive rock band Goblin, Simonetti has specialized in the scores for Italian and American horror films since the 1970s. A long-time collaborator of director Dario Argento, Simonetti has worked on several of the director/producer's films including Deep Red, Suspiria, Dawn of the Dead, Tenebrae, Phenomena, Demoni, and Opera. His work has long been an iconic staple of Italian genre cinema, collaborating with directors like Ruggero Deodato, Umberto Lenzi, Lucio Fulci, Enzo G. Castellari, Lamberto Bava, and Sergio Martino. His highly experimental scores are known for their signature, electronic and progressive rock-influenced sound, and have been imitated numerous times. He studied at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome.

  Dario Argento's World of Horror (Il Mondo dell'orrore di Dario Argento) is an Italian documentary film that chronicles the career of Italian director Dario Argento. The documentary features candid interviews with Argento and various stars from films he has directed, as well as extensive clips and behind-the-scenes footage of his films. The film includes segments focused on subjects as the soundtrack work, coloring and color filtering, and camerawork in Suspiria, the soundtrack for Inferno, the camerawork and insect effects in Phenomena, Tom Savini's make-up work in Dawn of the Dead, and the special effects, make-up and robotics in Dèmoni as well as interviews with Argento on a variety of esoteric subjects. Because most of Argento's films were only available in heavily edited form at the time, Dario Argento's World of Horror was sought after by many fans of the director's work because it contained numerous clips of footage removed from the released films, most notably the opening double murder sequence from Suspiria.

['The continental shelf is a relatively shallow and flat area of the ocean floor that extends from the shoreline to the continental slope. This geographical feature is typically found in areas where a continent meets the ocean, and it is characterized by a gradual slope that descends into deeper waters. The shelf is an important habitat for a variety of marine life, including fish, shellfish, and seabirds. It is also an important resource for human activities such as fishing, oil and gas exploration, and shipping. The depth of the continental shelf varies depending on the location, with some shelves extending for hundreds of miles offshore and others being much shallower. In general, the shelf is shallower in areas where the land has been uplifted or where the sea level has been lower in the past. The continental slope, which follows the edge of the shelf, is a steep drop-off that leads to the abyssal plain. This geographical feature is characterized by a sudden and dramatic change in depth, with the slope often descending to depths of over 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) within a few kilometers. The slope is an important habitat for a variety of marine life, including deep-sea fish, invertebrates, and other organisms that are adapted to living in extreme environments. The slope is also an important resource for human activities such as oil and gas exploration and deep-sea', 'what geographical feature of the ocean floor is between the shoreline and the continental slope']

  Continental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southernmost South America, and north-eastern Europe. In the western Atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas, for example, the Blake Plateau and Bermuda Rise. The Atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches: the Puerto Rico Trench (8376 m maximum depth) in the western Atlantic and South Sandwich Trench (8264 m) in the South Atlantic. There are numerous submarine canyons off north-eastern North America, western Europe, and north-western Africa. Some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep-sea channels. In 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred.

   The Siberian Shelf, one of the Arctic Ocean coastal shelves (such as the Milne Ice Shelf), is the largest continental shelf of the Earth, a part of the continental shelf of Russia. It extends from the continent of Eurasia in the general area of North Siberia (hence the name) into the Arctic Ocean. It stretches to 1500 km offshore. It is relatively shallow, with average depth of 100 m. A number of islands are within the shelf, including the Wrangel Island, Novaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian Islands. It is encompassed by the Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and East Siberian

  normally found below 3,000 metres. The greatest depth recorded for a benthic fish is 8,370 m. It may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme functions. Benthic fishes are more diverse and are likely to be found on the continental slope, where there is habitat diversity and often, food supplies. Approximately 40% of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains, but these flat, featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents and cause productive upwellings that support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges may separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.

  Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straightforward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel. The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise. The mean depth between 60°N and 60°S is 3730 m, or close to the average for the global ocean, with a modal depth between 4000 and 5000 m. In the South Atlantic the Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise form barriers to ocean currents. The Laurentian Abyss is found off the eastern coast of Canada.

  The Geikie Slide is a submarine landslide on the seabed of the North Atlantic Ocean to the northwest of Scotland. The slide occurs in a region known as the Hebridean Slope, the continental slope where the seabed drops from the continental shelf surrounding Britain (a depth of c. 200 m) into the deep ocean (a depth of c.1800 m). Since 2014 an area of 2215 km2 has been designated as a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area under the name Geikie Slide and Hebridean Slope MPA. The Geikie Slide is named after the Scottish geologist, Sir Archibald Geikie. The ecology of the Hebridean Slope region alters with the descent into deeper, with the sands and gravels of the continental shelf giving way to mud at lower depths. The bottom of the slope provides a habitat for creatures such as mud shrimp and deep sea crab, which build burrows in the mud. Sea urchin, sea spider, and deep sea worms are also found here, and the area is a breeding ground for fish such as blue ling.

  The shelf usually ends at a point of increasing slope (called the shelf break). The sea floor below the break is the continental slope. Below the slope is the continental rise, which finally merges into the deep ocean floor, the abyssal plain. The continental shelf and the slope are part of the continental margin. The shelf area is commonly subdivided into the inner continental shelf, mid continental shelf, and outer continental shelf, each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology. The character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break, where the continental slope begins. With a few exceptions, the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly 140 m; this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages, when sea level was lower than it is now. The continental slope is much steeper than the shelf; the average angle is 3°, but it can be as low as 1° or as high as 10°. The slope is often cut with submarine canyons. The physical mechanisms involved in forming these canyons were not well understood until the 1960s.

  A continental shelf is a portion of a continent that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea. Much of these shelves were exposed by drops in sea level during glacial periods. The shelf surrounding an island is known as an insular shelf. The continental margin, between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain, comprises a steep continental slope, surrounded by the flatter continental rise, in which sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope. Extending as far as 500 km (310 mi) from the slope, it consists of thick sediments deposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and slope. The continental rise's gradient is intermediate between the gradients of the slope and the shelf. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the seabed adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs.

  A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach the ocean surface. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise at least 1,000 meters above the seafloor. Seamounts became interesting during the 1960s, when it was discovered that they can maintain large stocks of commercially important fishes and invertebrates. From 1968 to about 1990, foreign fleets harvested pelagic armorhead across seamounts in the Hawaiian Ridge. Since 1984, fishing has been prohibited there so the stock can recover. Generally, seamounts are found in the high seas, outside the continental shelves, and outside the jurisdiction of any nation's EEZ. However, the U.S. Pacific Coast region has an unusually small continental shelf, while the Western Coast region contains islands with no continental shelf. As a result, there are some seamounts within U.S. jurisdiction.

  the Persian Gulf. The average width of continental shelves is about 80 km. The depth of the shelf also varies, but is generally limited to water shallower than 100 m. The slope of the shelf is usually quite low, on the order of 0.5°; vertical relief is also minimal, at less than 20 m. Though the continental shelf is treated as a physiographic province of the ocean, it is not part of the deep ocean basin proper, but the flooded margins of the continent. Passive continental margins such as most of the Atlantic coasts have wide and shallow shelves, made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent. Active continental margins have narrow, relatively steep shelves, due to frequent earthquakes that move sediment to the deep sea.

  slow, oxygen can persist much deeper because of the lack of nutrients to oxidize. Ocean sediment habitats can be divided into subduction zones, abyssal plains, and passive margins. At a subduction zone, where one plate is diving under another, a thick wedge of sediment tends to form. At first the sediment has 50 to 60 percent porosity; as it is compressed, fluids are expelled to form cold seeps or gas hydrates. Abyssal plains are the region between continental margins and mid-ocean ridges, usually at depths below 4 kilometers.

['Krispy Kreme, the doughnut chain that has been a staple in American culture for over 75 years, was founded in 1937 by a man named Vernon Rudolph. Rudolph was born in 1910 in South Carolina and grew up in a small town called Woodstock. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Rudolph returned to his hometown and began working for a local pharmacy.\n\nOne day, Rudolph came across a recipe for a yeast-raised doughnut that he found intriguing. He decided to try making the doughnuts himself, and after some experimentation, he perfected the recipe. Rudolph then opened his own doughnut shop in the back of the pharmacy, which he named Krispy Kreme.\n\nThe first Krispy Kreme store was located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where Rudolph had moved to be closer to his family. The store quickly gained popularity, and soon Rudolph was selling thousands of doughnuts each day.\n\nKrispy Kreme\'s signature product is the glazed doughnut, which is made using a secret recipe that has remained unchanged for over 75 years. The doughnuts are made fresh daily, and the company\'s signature "hot light" system ensures that customers can always enjoy a warm, fresh doughnut.\n\nToday', 'Where in the US was the first krispy kreme store located?']

  Since 1863, candy and candy-making materials have been made or sold in the premises at 110 Market Street (originally known as the High Street), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The location was part of an active candy-making industry that grew up around the sugar trade. In 1910, Philadelphia was home to as many as 1,200 confectioneries. Members of the Herring candy-making family operated several properties in the area beginning in the 1840s. Samuel L. Herring opened a wholesale confectionery supply business at 112 Market in the 1850s, expanding to 110 Market Street in 1863. After the American Civil War, his son Benjamin W. Herring took over the business. He eventually went into partnership with one of his father's employees, confectioner Daniel S. Dengler. The partners sold wholesale confectionery goods at 110 Market until Benjamin Herring died. Daniel S. Dengler and his son, Frank Dengler, continued to operate the

  Confiserie Roodthooft is a family company producing Belgian sweets and toffees. The company was founded by Louis Roodthooft and Johanna Stoops in Antwerp, Belgium in 1925. Roodthooft was in charge of sales whilst Stoops took care of the everyday running of the factory, which was not a usual thing for a Belgian woman to do back then. The company's most famous product is the 'Caramella Mokatine', also known as the 'Arabier', a coffee-flavoured sweet in a sachetti wrapper. The sachetti wrapper was introduced to Belgium by Louis Roodthooft in 1934. The third-generation family company currently exports to countries all over the world. Their latest range, "Our Original Belgian Toffees" combines original recipes from the 1920s with contemporary packaging. The company's headquarters are in a listed building built in 1905-7 by former students of Victor Horta.

It was not until 1990 the company, then marketed under the name Misfortune Kookies and based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, started producing its first five flavors: strawberry, lemon, orange, blueberry, and mint. Their cookies included 100 different comical fortunes, and were carried by Bloomingdale's retail chain, as well as other retail outlets. In 1992, the company relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, and seven years later moved to its present location and doubled the size of its production facility. The company created an online retail site in 1995, making it the first on-line seller of flavored and gourmet fortune cookies. It appeared in The Johnson Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation's 100 Growth report for Indiana businesses two consecutive years, in 1998 and 1999. The company continued to innovate, introducing giant fortune cookies in 1999. In 2011 they began selling caramel-dipped fortune cookies, another innovation because they don't require special shipping like chocolate-dipped cookies do.

  Froggy Fresh originally created songs under the name "Krispy Kreme". Starting with "The Baddest", these songs, accompanied by music videos, went viral. However, in December 2012, the rapper was forced to change his name by the Krispy Kreme doughnut company. While the rapper was intending to change his name to Jelly Bean Jack, the rapper opted to instead change his name to Froggy Fresh. The original title of the album was going to be Money Maker. However, due to the rapper being forced to change his name and the words "Krispy Kreme" being mentioned on the album's tracks, the album was discarded. Then the album was instead released as an extended version of the discarded album including an additional four tracks originally being held off for Froggy's following album. The music videos were treated similarly, as they were deleted and later re-uploaded in February 2013 with any mention of "Krispy Kreme" being dubbed over with "Froggy Fresh" or muted.

  The Krispy Kreme Challenge, a race invented and organized by NC State Park Scholars with a majority of runners attending NC State, is a new NC State tradition which attracted over 7,500 runners in 2010. Part of Hillsborough Street is closed in order for runners to make their way from the NC State Bell Tower to the Krispy Kreme on Peace Street. The objective is to run to the Krispy Kreme, eat one dozen doughnuts, and run back to the Bell Tower in under one hour. The event raises money to support the North Carolina Children's Hospital, and in 2010 raised $122 million.

Members of the Herring candy-making family operated several properties in the area beginning in the 1840s. Samuel L. Herring opened a wholesale confectionery supply business at 112 Market in the 1850s, expanding to 110 Market Street in 1863. After the American Civil War, his son Benjamin W. Herring took over the business. He eventually went into partnership with one of his father's employees, confectioner Daniel S. Dengler. The partners sold wholesale confectionery goods at 110 Market until Benjamin Herring died. Daniel S. Dengler and his son, Frank Dengler, continued to operate the

With his sidekick and ward, the sultry Sailor Duval (Bacall), tagging along, he encounters modern-day pirates and other tough situations while navigating the waters around Havana. Aboard his boat, the Bold Venture, Slate and Sailor experience "adventure, intrigue, mystery and romance in the sultry settings of tropical Havana and the mysterious islands of the Caribbean." Calypso singer King Moses (Jester Hairston) provided musical bridges by threading plot situations into the lyrics of his songs. Music for the series was by David Rose. The series combined elements of a number of past Bogart/Bacall film collaborations, most notably To Have and Have Not which also cast Bogart as a boat owner in the Caribbean who reluctantly becomes involved in intrigue while romancing Bacall. The relationship between Shannon and King Moses, and his ownership of an inn, is strongly reminiscent of the dynamic between Rick Blaine and Sam in Casablanca.

  The Church of England parish church of St Andrew stands towards the south of the village, and is built in flint and sarsen with limestone dressings. The mid 14th century building was thoroughly restored in 1861 by G. E. Street, and was designated as Grade II* listed in 1964. The former rectory house, opposite the start of the lane leading to the church, is an imposing redbrick building of the mid 18th century, with a five-bay front, two storeys and an attic. In 1991 the rectory was united with Pewsey, Easton Royal and Milton Lilbourne, and today the church is part

["The Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire, was a vast and powerful state that dominated the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of Southeastern Europe for over 400 years. The empire was founded in 1299 by Osman Bey, a Turkish chieftain, and grew in size and influence over the centuries.\n\nIn 1517, the Ottomans conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, which gave them control over the holy city of Mecca and the pilgrimage routes to it. This event marked the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's expansion into the Arab world.\n\nIn 1516, the Ottomans also took over the territory of modern-day Iraq, which was previously under the control of the Safavid Empire. This expansion allowed the Ottomans to establish a direct land route between their territories in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIn 1517, the Ottomans also conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, which gave them control over the holy city of Mecca and the pilgrimage routes to it.

  The Ottoman Empire defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the Safavids on the Eastern side, the Byzantine Empire in the North which vanished with the Conquest of Constantinople in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies. Later, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699. The Ottoman sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922 and the caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924.

  From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems. In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed al-Fatat ("the Young Arab Society"), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was "raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations." In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces. After World War I, when the Ottoman Empire was overthrown by the British Empire, former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the British and French as League of Nations mandates.

   Among the Turkish leaders, the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman I and his son Orhan I. The Anatolian beyliks were successively absorbed into the rising Ottoman Empire during the 15th century. It is not well understood how the Osmanlı, or Ottoman Turks, came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum) from the Knights of Saint John.

  In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government). In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan under the leadership of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775–76. Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further

  Remnants of the Byzantine Empire from Eastern Europe were united under Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II by 1453, and the empire incorporated a vast collection of territories surrounding the Mediterranean. The Ottoman Sultan had succeeded in “superimposing” the Byzantine empire with Ottoman Rule. Ottoman lands contained a wide variety of cultural, legal and religious traditions. The Ottomans maintained an aeque principali empire where local customs and traditional practices were perpetuated. In many cases, the Ottomans allowed subject peoples including Christians and Jews to have their own communities where their own particular laws and customs were retained and integrated into the broader Ottoman system; which often included separate legal codes for each

   Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, under Selim I, and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the Mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. Cairo continued to be a major economic center and one of the empire's most important cities. It remained the principal staging point for the pilgrimage (Hajj) route to Mecca. While the Ottoman governors were not major patrons of architecture like the Mamluks, Cairo nonetheless continued to develop and new neighbourhoods did grow outside the old city walls. Ottoman architecture in Cairo continued to be heavily influenced and derived from the local Mamluk-era traditions rather than presenting a clear break with the past. Some individuals, such as Abd ar-Rahman Katkhuda al-Qazdaghli, a mamluk official among the Janissaries in the 18th century, were prolific architectural patrons. Many old bourgeois or aristocratic mansions that have been preserved in Cairo today date from the Ottoman period, as do a number of sabil-kuttabs (a combination of water distribution kiosk and Qur'anic reading school).

  Palestinian people have a history that is often linked to the history of the Arab Nation. When Islam was started by Muhammad in Mecca in 610, Christianity was the major religion of Byzantine Palestine. Soon after the rise of Islam, Palestine was conquered and brought into the rapidly expanding Islamic empire. The Umayyad empire was the first of three successive dynasties to dominate the Arab-Islamic world and rule Palestine, followed by the Abbasids and the Fatimids. Muslim rule was briefly challenged and interrupted in parts of Palestine during the Crusades, but was restored under the Mamluks. After toppling the Mamluk state in 1517, the Ottoman Turks took control of most of the Arab world. Palestine existed within the Ottoman Empire as two districts, also referred to as Sanjaks. The legal origin of citizenship in the Middle East was born of the Ottoman Citizenship Law of 19 January 1869 and the Treaty of Lausanne.

  under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus. In 1830, on the eve of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns. In 1840, Britain intervened and returned control of

  The Ottoman–Mamluk War of 1516–1517 was the second major conflict between the Egypt-based Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire, which led to the fall of the Mamluk Sultanate and the incorporation of the Levant, Egypt, and the Hejaz as provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The war transformed the Ottoman Empire from a realm at the margins of the Islamic world, mainly located in Anatolia and the Balkans, to a huge empire encompassing much of the traditional lands of Islam, including the cities of Mecca, Cairo, Damascus, and Aleppo. Despite this expansion, the seat of the empire's political power remained in Constantinople.

 1 -6.29428   Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, under Selim I, and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the Mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. Cairo continued to be a major economic center and one of the empire's most important cities. It remained the principal staging point for the pilgrimage (Hajj) route to Mecca. While the Ottoman governors were not major patrons of architecture like the Mamluks, Cairo nonetheless continued to develop and new neighbourhoods did grow outside the old city walls. Ottoman architecture in Cairo continued to be heavily influenced and derived from the local Mamluk-era traditions rather than presenting a clear break with the past. Some individuals, such as Abd ar-Rahman Katkhuda al-Qazdaghli, a mamluk official among the Janissaries in the 18th century, were prolific architectural patrons. Many old bourgeois or aristocratic mansions that have been preserved in Cairo today date from the Ottoman period, as do a number of sabil-kuttabs (a combination of water distribution kiosk and Qur'anic reading school).

Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems. In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed al-Fatat ("the Young Arab Society"), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was "raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations." In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces. After World War I, when the Ottoman Empire was overthrown by the British Empire, former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the British and French as League of Nations mandates.

According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population.

  "Livin' Thing" is a song written by Jeff Lynne and performed by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It appears on ELO's 1976 album A New World Record and was also released as a single. Patti Quatro sang uncredited vocals, particularly the "higher and higher" parts. In August 2006, "Livin' Thing" was named by the UK's Q as the number 1 "Guilty Pleasure" single of all time – a list designed to celebrate "uncool" but excellent records, and which received considerable publicity. The original single had the bonus of having "Fire On High" on the flip side, a tune that became the band's most popular instrumental piece. The UK version was released in a blue vinyl format.

  "Ride the Wild" / "It's a Hectic World" is the 1980 debut single by the American punk rock band the Descendents. It was the band's first release and displayed a new wave and surf sound. It was recorded at a time when the band lacked a lead singer, so vocals on the recording were provided by guitarist Frank Navetta and bassist Tony Lombardo. With the addition of singer Milo Aukerman in 1980, the band moved towards a hardcore punk sound. "Ride the Wild" and "It's a Hectic World" were re-released in later years on compilation albums.

  Gary Lewis & the Playboys were an American 1960s era pop and rock group, fronted by musician Gary Lewis, the son of comedian Jerry Lewis. They are best known for their 1965 Billboard Hot 100 number-one single "This Diamond Ring", which was the first of a string of hit singles they had in 1965 and 1966. The band had an earnest, boy-next-door image similar to British invasion contemporaries such as Herman's Hermits and Gerry and the Pacemakers. The group folded in 1970, but a version of the band later resumed touring and continues to tour, often playing for veterans' benefits.

  "Love Is All Around" is a song recorded by English rock band the Troggs, featuring a string quartet and a 'tick tock' sound on percussion, in D-major. It was written by lead singer Reg Presley and was purportedly inspired by a television transmission of the Joy Strings Salvation Army band's "Love That's All Around".

Allmusic described the act's style: "Part of the secret behind the Outsiders' musical success lay in the group's embellishments [with horns and strings], which slotted in perfectly with their basic three- or four-piece instrumental sound. . . . however bold and ambitious they got, one never lost the sense of a hard, solid band sound at the core."

  Charles Howard Holbrow was born in Melrose, Massachusetts to parents Frederick Holbrow and Florence Louisa (Gile) Holbrow. His earliest memory of interest in physics dates from about age 13, when he saved the money he earned delivering newspapers to buy a book by Robert Andrews Millikan, Electrons (+And -) Protons Photons Neutrons Mesotrons and Cosmic Rays. "I read about two pages, and it made no sense to me whatsoever," he said. "But I still have the book, and now it makes lots of sense." In 1951, at age 15, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a Ford Foundation Pre-Induction Fellow. Despite his early interest and intention to major in physics, he found physics coursework so challenging that

  Keith was born in Wisconsin, where his father, a British-born field biologist and Canadian Wildlife Service civil servant named Anthony Keith. attended grad school. His mother, Deborah Gorham, was a history professor at Carleton University. Keith grew up in Great Britain and in Ottawa, Ontario. His stepmother was a biologist, like his father. Keith is a citizen of Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. He enjoyed reading and birdwatching with his father and later took up cross-country skiing, rock climbing and winter camping. Keith's interest in physics was strengthened by spending several summers working in the National Research Council laser lab of experimental physicist Paul Corkum, beginning around the end of high school. In 1986 Keith graduated with a B.S. in physics from the University of Toronto. He developed a love of the Arctic when he spent part of a gap year between undergraduate and graduate studies as a wildlife biologist's research assistant on Devon Island in Nunavut. Since then he has canoed on the Yellowknife River, hiked Holman Island and crossed rough sea ice from Iglulik to Arctic Bay on skis.

At a cultural programme three months ago, a frustrated Umap declared that he was fed up with making innumerable requests to the government. "I don’t think I will get a house in my lifetime," he had said. Then chief minister Ashok Chavan had earlier sanctioned plush houses to many artistes — several of them lower in stature than Umap. Then deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who was present at the show, vowed that he would get the singer a flat and fulfilled his promise within a fortnight.

  beauty as transient, since the only immutable beauty was that of God. From the 19th century, however, a change of attitude towards ephemeral beauty began to take place, and it began to be valued for its intrinsic qualities. The Romantics valued 'what will never be seen twice', and Goethe went so far as to assert that only the ephemeral is beautiful: 'Why am I ephemeral, O Zeus? says Beauty / I do not make beautiful, says Zeus, any more than the ephemeral' (The Seasons). Although various manifestations that can be considered as ephemeral art have existed since the beginnings of human artistic expressivity

Some fans have interpreted the town of San Pedro on the island of Ambergris Caye, Belize, as the San Pedro mentioned in the song. However, Madonna clarified to Rolling Stone: "I don't know where San Pedro is. At that point, I wasn't a person who went on holidays to beautiful islands. I may have been on the way to the studio and seen an exit ramp for San Pedro." She described the song as her tribute to the "beauty and mystery of Latin American people".

['In the 2018 midterm elections, voters in California will have the opportunity to cast their ballots in a primary that does not label the party of the candidates. This is due to a new law that was passed in 2016, which aims to make the primary system more open and accessible to voters.\n\nUnder the old system, California held a "closed primary," which meant that only registered members of a political party could vote in that party\'s primary. This often led to a situation where the candidate with the most support from the party\'s base would win the primary, but not necessarily the general election.\n\nThe new law, known as the "Top Two" or "Jungle" primary, changes this by allowing all registered voters to participate in the primary, regardless of party affiliation. The top two candidates, regardless of party, will then advance to the general election.\n\nThis system has been in place in California since 2010, and has been credited with increasing voter turnout and encouraging more moderate candidates to run. It has also been criticized by some who argue that it can lead to a lack of representation for smaller parties and independent candidates.\n\nIn the upcoming midterm elections, voters in California will have the opportunity to choose from a diverse and competitive field of candidates, regardless of party affiliation. This is a significant change from the old system, which often left voters feeling disenfr', 'What is a primary that does not label the party of the candidates called?']

  California changed its rules before the 2018 midterm elections to allow people other than family members to collect and submit ballots. Last-minute submissions of votes in the election delayed results and some pundits and Republican politicians suggested that it influenced the outcome of several elections. While the Los Angeles Times editorial board rejected claims that any elections were affected by the new ballot harvesting law in the 2018 midterms, it did call for the law to be fixed or repealed, saying the law "does open the door to coercion and fraud." Republicans, in turn, are seeking to improve their own use of the practice, according to The Washington Post.

  The California state elections in 2020 were held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. Unlike previous election cycles, the primary elections were held on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. In addition to the U.S. presidential race, California voters elected all of California's seats to the House of Representatives, all of the seats of the State Assembly, and all odd-numbered seats of the State Senate. Neither of the state's two U.S. Senate seats were up for election in 2020. Pursuant to Proposition 14 passed in 2010, California uses a nonpartisan blanket primary for almost all races, with the presidential primary races being the notable exception. Under the nonpartisan blanket primary system, all the candidates for the same elected office, regardless of respective political party, run against each other at once during the primary. The candidates receiving the most and second-most votes in the primary election then become the contestants in the general election.

The non-partisan blanket primary (aka "jungle primary" or top-two primary) is a single primary election in which all voters may participate, and all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party affiliation or lack of party affiliation. The top two most-voted candidates (even if members of the same party) will appear in the general election. This is intended to allow non-partisan voters and candidates to participate, and to allow more moderate nominees in the general election (since voters from both sides of the spectrum can vote for them). However, the non-partisan blanket primary still only allows voters a single choice per office,

  The 2019 Louisiana gubernatorial election was held to elect the Governor of Louisiana. Incumbent Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards won reelection to a second term, defeating Republican businessman Eddie Rispone. Edwards became the first Louisiana Democrat to secure consecutive terms since Edwin Edwards (no relation to John Bel Edwards) in 1975. It was the closest Louisiana gubernatorial election since 1979. Under Louisiana's jungle primary system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. Because no candidate received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 12, 2019, a runoff election was held on November 16, 2019, between the top two candidates in the primary, Edwards and Rispone. Louisiana is the only state that has a jungle primary system (California and Washington have a similar top two primary system). According to the Louisiana Secretary of State more than 384,000 early votes were cast, a significant increase from the 2015 gubernatorial election in which 234,000 early votes were cast.

  the 2012 elections, there were eleven such contest victories. The 2014 elections will be informative as to the durability of these conditions, as many first-term representatives will then be running as incumbents, usually an advantage. This typical advantage will likely be affected by the new open primary system in some manner. Prior to the two major changes in California elections (neutral reapportionment and open primaries), Republicans controlled nineteen of the delegation's House seats, subsequently, only fifteen, a loss of four seats, a significant number considering that nationwide only a total of four additional House seats were lost to the party.

  Proponents posit that the Unified Primary system will increase voter choice by allowing all voters to participate equally in all stages of the election process, by allowing voters to express support for more than a single candidate, and by allowing all candidates to compete in a uniform election process, regardless of political party affiliation or lack of affiliation. In contrast, FairVote, a national election reform non-profit that advocates instant-runoff voting, theorized that it is likely that general election races would have two finalists from the same major party in districts where a majority of voters affiliate with that party, and thereby reduce voter choice in the election that has statistically higher turnout than current primary elections. Election method simulation of various voting systems indicate that an election system comprising approval voting

He was a son of Charles d'Albert, 1st Duke of Luynes, a favorite of Louis XIII, and Princess Marie Aimée de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Montbazon (1600–1679). After his father's death, his mother remarried to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse (a son of Henry I, Duke of Guise), with whom she had three daughters. Upon Claude's death in 1655, the Chevreuse peerage became extinct and his mother bought the duchy. After her death in August 1679, Louis-Charles inherited the duchy of Chevreuse, and his descendants have held it since. His maternal grandparents were Hercules de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon and, his first wife, Marie de Bretagne d'Avaugour.

  Anne suffered two failed betrothals before her marriage. The first was to Ladislaus of Hungary, son of Charles I of Hungary and Elisabeth of Poland, but Ladislaus died in 1329. If Ladislaus had survived and the pair had married, Anne could have become Queen of Hungary. She was then betrothed to Louis VI the Roman. This betrothal ended because Louis's father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, could have been excommunicated by the Pope. Anne was eventually married on 16 February 1335, to Otto, Duke of Austria. This was a second marriage for Otto; his first wife, Elizabeth of Bavaria, had died after bearing him two sons. Anne was seven years old at the time. The marriage lasted for eight years and resulted in a closer alliance between Anne's father and the Holy Roman Emperor, but Anne died at the age of fifteen in 1338, long before she and Otto could have children. Otto followed her in death shortly thereafter and was succeeded by his sons from his first marriage to Elisabeth of Bavaria.

  The way the chocolate was brought to Spanish ports shows that, during the 17th century, it was one of the most precious commodities brought from overseas. In 1691 an attempt was made to restrict distribution and it soon met with the opposition of the majority of Andalusian merchants. Chocolate was brought to France by the Jesuits and after being promoted by queens of Spanish origin: Anne of Austria (daughter of Philip III of Spain and wife of Louis XIII of France) and Maria Theresa of Spain (daughter of Philip IV of Spain), who moved to France in 1660 to marry Louis XIV of France (the Sun King). As a result, in the 17th century, chocolate became fashionable in Paris. Voltaire quotes this drink in his works in the 18th century.

This betrothal ended because Louis's father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, could have been excommunicated by the Pope. Anne was eventually married on 16 February 1335, to Otto, Duke of Austria. This was a second marriage for Otto; his first wife, Elizabeth of Bavaria, had died after bearing him two sons. Anne was seven years old at the time. The marriage lasted for eight years and resulted in a closer alliance between Anne's father and the Holy Roman Emperor, but Anne died at the age of fifteen in 1338, long before she and Otto could have children. Otto followed her in death shortly thereafter and was succeeded by his sons from his first marriage to Elisabeth of Bavaria.

Signed to Christian record label, Word Records, they have been reviewed extensively by Christian media and have played and charted on Christian radio. Jakoub has attempted to distance the band from the Christian band label stating, "we've actually never classified our music as 'Christian rock', we have always been an alternative band on all formats." "I don't believe in using faith as a marketing tool, it's not a commodity. Just let an artist write from that place of vulnerable honesty, and let the listener connect through their own story."

Ulmer (also credited with original story) and featuring top-billed John Carradine and Gale Sondergaard whose performance in one of 1936's Academy Award for Best Picture nominees, Anthony Adverse, earned her the first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Isle of Forgotten Sins was subsequently reissued in a version cut from 82 to 74 minutes and retitled Monsoon. It proved to be the final film role for German-American actress Betty Amann as well as the last feature for producer Peter R. Van Duinen's Atlantis Pictures, a unit whose films had a higher budget then most of PRC's releases. Third-listed supporting actor Sidney Toler worked on this PRC title between the finish of his Charlie Chan films at 20th Century Fox and just before their resumption at Monogram Pictures. The film features several songs (with Carradine singing "Whiskey Johnny"), an underwater sequence using a marionette and a tropical monsoon climax.

  Carry On Cabby is a 1963 British comedy film, the seventh in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). Released on 7 November 1963, it was the first to have a screenplay written by Talbot Rothwell (although the first screenplay "Tolly" submitted to Peter Rogers was developed as Carry On Jack) from a story by Dick Hills and Sid Green (script writers for Morecambe and Wise).

The film is notable from others in the series for its dramatic plotline of a troubled marriage.

 Jane Ruth Aceng (born 11 May 1968), is a Ugandan pediatrician and politician. She is the Minister of Health in the Cabinet of Uganda. She was appointed to that position on 6 June 2016. Before that, from June 2011 until June 2016, she served as the Director General of Medical Services in the Ugandan Ministry of Health.

Background and education
She was born on 11 May 1968. She attended Shimoni Primary School in Kampala, Uganda's capital city. She studied at Nabisunsa Girls Secondary School for both her Ordinary and Advanced Level education. She holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, a Master of Medicine in Pediatrics, and a Master of Public Health, all from the Makerere University College of Health Sciences. She also holds a Diploma in Health Systems Management awarded by the Galilee International Management Institute, in Israel.

Career
She began serving as a medical officer in the health ministry. At the time she was appointed Director General of Medical Services, she was serving as executive director of Lira Regional Referral Hospital.

Other considerations
Aceng is a member of the board of directors of the Infectious Diseases Institute. She also served as a member of the board of Uganda National Medical Stores, the pharmaceutical procurement and distribution arm of the health ministry, from 2005 until 2016.

Political career
In July 2020, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng declared her intentions to contest for the position of Women Representative for Lira District, in the 11th Parliament (2021 - 2026). She intends to run on the ruling National Resistance Movement political party ticket.

Controversy
As early as 2014, three variables in the national health system began to converge to the level of a crisis. 
 Uganda has at least 8 public and private medical schools, graduating close to 500 medical doctors annually. Before they receive their medical licenses, each doctor has to undergo 12 months of rigorous supervision under a consultant physician or surgeon. 
 Due to poor pay, dilapidated equipment, lack of resources including medication and a poor work environment, many Ugandan medical and surgical consultants have left to work in better environments in other countries. 
 The small national healthcare budget leaves the health ministry with insufficient funds to pay the few consultants left, the senior house officers (SHOs) training to become consultants, and the ever-increasing number of interns working so they can get licensed.
As a consequence, the ministry of health has been pitted against the SHOs who are not compensated at all and the interns who are poorly and irregularly paid. In an attempt to conserve funds, Aceng as minister has accused some universities of graduating too many substandard doctors, although both the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC) and the East African Community Medical and Dental Practitioners Boards and Councils disagree with her. These are the statutory government agencies in the East African Community which are mandated to maintain the standard of medical and dental training and physician and dentist competency.

Perhaps the most controversial of all her proposals is the new requirement that interns take a new national examination, before the health ministry can assign them an internship slot. This has not gone well with the 2016/2017 intern class, prompting a lawsuit that is still winding through the legal system.

Research works
She has participated and published widely in the field of medicine and some of her works are outlined below;
 2021: The Ugandan Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Model: A Data Driven Approach to Estimate Risk
 2020: Estimating the Effect and Cost-Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Uganda

He participated in the Lancaster House Conference in London prior to Uganda's independence from Britain which was granted on 9 October 1962. Abu Mayanja resigned in April 1964 after the Speaker, Mr Eriasafi Kalule insulted him during a session of the Lukiiko (Parliament of Buganda). He was, however, later that year elected by the Lukiiko as MP in September 1964 following the resignation of Jimmy Simpson as representative of Kyaggwe North East.

 The Uganda Ministry of Health (UMoH) announced it has started vaccinating frontline health workers against the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).
In vaccinating frontline health workers against EVD, Uganda health authorities are cautiously hoping to prevent another outbreak.
It is highly likely that Uganda may import EVD from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) given the closeness of the current epicenter, the high population movements due to trade, social-cultural connections and easy accessibility of health services in Uganda.
This preventive exercise has begun in the Ntoroko district which is located in central Africa.
The UMoH said in a press release that the Ebola vaccination program will be expanded to the 5 high-risk districts: Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Kasese, Ntoroko, and Bunyangabu bordering the DRC.
Uganda’s Minister of Health, Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng said she believes that the administration of the Ebola vaccine to frontline healthcare workers has been the missing link in the country’s EVD preparation and readiness efforts.
A total of 2,100 doses of Merck’s ‘rVSV-Ebola’ vaccine candidate will be administered to the health workers to protect them against the type of Ebola virus strain that is currently circulating in some parts of the DRC.
The rVSV-Ebola vaccine is currently being administered in the DRC and is demonstrating positive protective results and potency against the Ebola virus-Zaire type.
Although the ‘rVSV-Ebola’ vaccine is not commercially licensed, it is being used under “expanded access” or what is also known as “compassionate use” in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC.
As of October 29, 2018, Ebola vaccination totals have reached 24,142 people in the DRC.
To alert international travelers of the expanding Ebola situation in the DRC, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upgraded its Travel Alert to Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions, on October 19, 2018.
As of November 7, 2018, the CDC had not issued a Travel Alert for Uganda.
This Merck vaccine candidate rVSV-Ebola was also used in the Ebola outbreak in Equateur province in May-July 2018.
In 2015, the rVSV-Ebola vaccine was given to more than 16,000 volunteers involved in several studies in Africa, Europe and the United States where it was found to be safe and protective against the Ebola virus.
Although several studies have shown that the vaccine is safe and protective against the Ebola virus, more scientific research is needed before it can be licensed.
“Therefore, the rVSV-Ebola vaccine is not available to the general population at this stage. This is targeted vaccination,” Dr. Aceng emphasized.
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there is not enough valid research to risk the health of pregnant women nor their future child with the investigational vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV.

Career
She began serving as a medical officer in the health ministry. At the time she was appointed Director General of Medical Services, she was serving as executive director of Lira Regional Referral Hospital.

Other considerations
Aceng is a member of the board of directors of the Infectious Diseases Institute. She also served as a member of the board of Uganda National Medical Stores, the pharmaceutical procurement and distribution arm of the health ministry, from 2005 until 2016.

Although the ‘rVSV-Ebola’ vaccine is not commercially licensed, it is being used under “expanded access” or what is also known as “compassionate use” in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC.
As of October 29, 2018, Ebola vaccination totals have reached 24,142 people in the DRC.
To alert international travelers of the expanding Ebola situation in the DRC, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upgraded its Travel Alert to Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions, on October 19, 2018.
As of November 7, 2018, the CDC had not issued a Travel Alert for Uganda.
This Merck vaccine candidate rVSV-Ebola was also used in the Ebola outbreak in Equateur province in May-July 2018.
In 2015, the rVSV-Ebola vaccine was given to more than 16,000 volunteers involved in several studies in Africa, Europe and the United States where it was found to be safe and protective against the Ebola virus.
Although several studies have shown that the vaccine is safe and protective against the Ebola virus, more scientific research is needed before it can be licensed.
“Therefore, the rVSV-Ebola vaccine is not available to the general population at this stage. This is targeted vaccination,” Dr. Aceng emphasized.
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there is not enough valid research to risk the health of pregnant women nor their future child with the investigational vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV.

  Shinola is an American luxury goods retailer based in Detroit, Michigan. It produces watches, bicycles, and leather goods, among other products. Founded in 2011, Shinola takes its name from the defunct Shinola shoe polish company. The company was founded by Tom Kartsotis and is owned and operated by Texas-based investment group Bedrock Brands.

  Shinola's leather goods and leather watch straps are made using leather predominantly supplied by the Chicago-based tannery, Horween Leather, which has been in operation since 1905. The tanning of the leather takes months, using a process that showcases the natural characteristics of the leather. Shinola leather watch straps were once made by Hadley-Roma in Key Largo, Florida, but are now produced at their factory in Detroit. A partial list of Shinola leather goods includes iPad and iPhone cases, wallets, portfolios, backpacks, and more. In 2014, Shinola opened its own leather factory in Detroit, and has begun manufacturing leather watch straps under the leadership of Braloba, a Swiss-based, family-owned company run by Thomas Schori. The leather factory is equipped with custom-designed machines produced by Galli S.P.A. The company will also begin producing small leather goods and accessories in-house. Shinola also sells watch straps individually; leather straps come from Hadley Roma in Largo, Florida and  Horween Leather in Chicago, and rubber watch straps made in partnership with Stern Manufacturing of Staples, Minnesota. The company also revived production of shoe polish in 2013, albeit in a different formulation and tin can packaging.

This is the finest and last surviving of three grand theatres formerly located in Okmulgee. The Orpheum's architecture, which is an elegant derivation of Spanish Baroque Revival, includes a colorful lobby which is the finest example in Oklahoma of the interior use of polychrome terra cotta. The historic Okmulgee County Courthouse, at 314 W. 7th, was built in 1916 and is also NRHP listed. The Creeks initially built a two-story log council house to serve as their capital.

  The courthouse building was built in 1911, the courthouse was designed by the architecture firm of Layton, Smith & Hawk and constructed by Oklahoma Quarries & Construction Co. The courthouse sits on a 1 acre parcel of land in downtown Sayre, at the intersection of Third and Walnut Streets. It is a three-story building measuring 66 feet in the east-west direction and 99 feet in the north-south direction. It is faced with tan bricks and stone. The east and west entrances to the courthouse each feature two Tuscan columns which span the second and third floors; the columns are flanked by brick pilasters. A dentillated cornice and a brick parapet encircle the building at its roof line. Although the NRHP application did not list a particular style of architecture, another source claims that the building blends Neo-Classical and Second Renaissance Revival styles. A large dome supported by twelve Doric columns rises from an octagonal base on the roof of the courthouse. A smaller dome, similarly styled and supported by twelve columns, rises from the top of the main dome. The large dome has flat panels for clocks facing four directions.

  First National Bank is a historic building located in downtown Ottumwa, Iowa, United States. It is significant for its architectural design and its use of terra cotta for the exterior, the only bank in town so clad. Chicago architect H. H. Stoddard designed the building in the Neoclassical style. It was built by the Blackhawk Construction Company in 1915. The building replaced the original 1868 bank building rebuilt after a fire in 1881, also at this location. The two-story structure features a pediment and two columns flanking the main entrance. The exterior is composed entirely of cream colored terra cotta. Dentil ornamentation is found across the top of the building. Initially the building was a single story with 25 ft ceilings, but it was altered to its present form in 1956. The glass wall of the main facade was also added at that time. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

  The stem of the T extends northeast to the rear of the building. Arches and other decorative elements are shaped out of ashlar granite in alternating light and dark colors. The building's roof is slate; the front portion is hipped, with the center interrupted by the front-facing gable. The rear section ends in a gable. Inside the hall, the front houses town offices, and a space that was originally used as a GAR meeting space, and the rear of the building houses an auditorium with stage. Interior spaces have not been significantly altered since the building's construction was completed, and most continue to be used for their original purpose. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and was included as a contributing property in the Monson Center Historic District in 1991.

  The Sayre Downtown Historic District is a commercial historic district located in downtown Sayre, Oklahoma. The district comprises a three-block area of Main and 4th Streets; it includes 39 buildings, of which 24 are contributing buildings. The oldest buildings in the district date from between 1903 and 1909, when a building boom replaced Sayre's frame downtown buildings with brick Commercial style structures. By the 1920s, the downtown area had reached its current size, and most of the buildings in the district had been built. In the 1920s, U.S. Route 66 was routed through the district, increasing traffic for local businesses. Sayre's Classical Revival post office, a contributing property, was constructed in 1938; the post office includes a Works Progress Administration mural painted in 1940. The downtown remained prosperous until the 1950s, when population decline and the bypassing of Route 66 led to a decrease in commercial activity.

  The Terry Hutchens Building is a historic office and apartment building in Huntsville, Alabama. The seven story structure was originally constructed in 1925 for the Tennessee Valley Bank, with office space rented to other tenants. In 2002, the upper floors were renovated into condominiums. The structure is of steel reinforced concrete faced with brick, giving a Gothic Revival appearance. The ground floor façade has large display windows separated by brick piers, and has a central, arched entry covered in masonry. The Jefferson Street façade was originally treated the same way, but was modified with a flat wall of thin brick above two storefront entrances. A decorative band with rowlock course brick and terra cotta panels separate the ground floor from the rest of the building. Above, the piers divide each bay containing a pair of one-over-one sash windows; on the seventh floor, a green terra cotta frog sits on the sill, between the windows. Each bay of the cornice is divided by terra cotta decorated with Gothic shapes and medallions on panels of brick. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

  Nye was born in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. He attended the University of Pennsylvania. He was noted for his striking appearance which consisted of dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. After many years of stage acting, he settled in Los Angeles where he lived with his father, U.S. Grant Nye, in the Sunset Junction section of the Silver Lake neighborhood of town according to the 1920 census reports. On October 3, 1929, at age 40, Nye walked into his apartment to find his father had committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. He also found an apology letter written by his father explaining that he was sorry for taking his own life and he couldn't "bear this physical condition." At 67 years old the elder Nye was suffering from the effects of three paralytic strokes. Nye would continue to appear in films until the 1950s.

Many scientists were critical of Nye for accepting Ham's invitation, claiming his participation in the debate gave Ham's views undeserved legitimacy, but two humanist groups &ndash; the American Humanist Association and the Center for Inquiry &ndash; praised Nye's decision. Scientists, both Christian and non-Christian, generally agreed that Nye won the debate, at least in terms of the science presented, although they debated how convincing the victory was. Ham later announced that the publicity generated by the debate had spurred fundraising for AiG's planned Ark Encounter theme park, allowing the ministry to begin construction. Both Ham and Nye have since released books on the debate.

['Claude Monet, a French impressionist painter, is famed for his paintings of the water lilies in his garden. Monet\'s series of water lily paintings, known as the "Water Lilies," were created over a period of 30 years, from 1899 to 1926. The series consists of over 250 oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and pastels, depicting the water lilies in his garden at Giverny, France. Monet\'s use of light and color in these paintings is particularly noteworthy, as he sought to capture the changing moods and atmospheric conditions of the garden. The "Water Lilies" series is considered one of Monet\'s most significant and influential works, and it has had a profound impact on the development of modern art.', 'Which artist was famed for his paintings of the water lilies in his garden?']

  The Water Lilies is a 1919 painting by impressionist Claude Monet, one of his Water Lilies series. The painting, the left hand panel of a large pair, depicts a scene in Monet's French pond showing light reflecting off the water with water lilies on the surface. It is on display in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. One of Monet's larger paintings, it shows the beauty of the sunset reflecting off the water.

Two fountains were the centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both taken from the myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668–70) designed by André Le Nôtre and sculpted by Gaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents the story of how the peasants of Lycia tormented Latona and her children, Diana and Apollo, and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis's mother, Anne of Austria, during the uprising called the Fronde in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of water pour

  The Beach at Honfleur is an oil-on-canvas painting by French impressionist Claude Monet. The painting depicts a beach on the Côte de Grâce with sailboats, the hospital of Honfleur, and a lighthouse in the distance. In the foreground, a solitary figure in a blue smock stands on the beach. The painting was created with short, thick brushstrokes, typical of Impressionism. Monet painted The Beach at Honfleur in the summer of 1864, when he and Frédéric Bazille were staying at nearby Sainte-Adresse, where Monet's parents kept a summer house. Monet painted several scenes of the harbor, jetty, and town of Honfleur during this time period, including A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur. A painting reminiscent of The Beach at Honfleur is depicted in Studio on Rue Furstenberg (1866) by Bazille. Monet and Bazille shared this studio in Paris from 1864–1866.

Greenery is everywhere and numerous trees can be seen in the background. In 1886 van Gogh left Holland for Paris never to return. His brother Theo, a successful Parisian art dealer, provided van Gogh the support and connections for an immersion in modern art. In the two years, from 1886 through 1888, van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. During 1886 van Gogh was introduced to Impressionist artists and their works, such as Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In 1887 van Gogh continued to make important connections with other artists who he befriended and exchanged paintings with, such as Louis Anquetin, Émile Bernard, Armand Guillaumin, Lucien Pissarro and Paul Signac. Having been introduced to Impressionism and Pointillism in Paris, van Gogh began experimenting with related techniques. Van Gogh also utilized complementary colors to allow the formation of vibrant contrasts which enhance each other when juxtaposed.

Giverny and more specifically Claude Monet, inspired Perry to work with en plein air forms, impressionistic brushstrokes, soft colors, and poppy red. In the window of La Petite Angèle, II we see the beginnings of what would become Perry's love affair with the Impressionist's handling of the landscape theme. By the fall of 1889 Perry had departed from Giverny to tour Belgium and the Netherlands and she had returned to Boston with her family in 1891 with a painting by Monet and a series of landscapes by John Breck.

   Decorative Impressionism is an art historical term that is credited to the art writer Christian Brinton, who first used it in 1911. Brinton titled an article on the American expatriate painter Frederick Carl Frieseke, one of the members of the famous Giverny Colony of American Impressionists, "The Decorative Impressionist." However, use of the term has been revived in recent decades by the influential and prolific art historian William H. Gerdts to describe the figurative works of not only Frieseke, but some of his Giverny compatriots including Richard E. Miller, Louis Ritman and Robert Reid. The same term has been applied to other Giverny school painters who painted the figure including Guy Rose, Karl Anderson and Karl Albert Buehr. Decorative Impressionism describes a way of

["The mirror crack'd from side to side;\n'The sage is dead,' said the bystander,\n'And all we learn of him is here,\nIn this frail glass, you which one was he?'\n\nQuoth she, 'The beauty is no more;\nThat dream, that shapely shadow, gone.'\n\nThe line 'The mirror crack'd from side to side' comes from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem 'Kubla Khan'. The poem is a fragment, and the line is the opening line. The poem is a dream-like vision, and the mirror cracking is a symbolic representation of the dream's disruption. The speaker is describing a scene in which a bystander is commenting on the death of a sage, and the speaker is reflecting on the loss of beauty and the fleeting nature of dreams. The line is significant because it sets the tone for the rest of the poem, which is filled with surreal and dreamlike imagery.", "The line 'The mirror crack'd from side to side' comes from which poem?"]

  In Tennyson's poem, the Lady of Shalott is confined to a tower on an island near Camelot, cursed not to leave the tower or look out of its windows. She weaves a tapestry, viewing the outside world only through reflections in a mirror behind her. The painting depicts the pivotal scene in the third part of the poem: the Lady spies "bold Sir Launcelot" in her mirror. The sight of the handsome knight and the sound of him singing draws her away from her loom to the window, yarn still clinging around her knees, bringing down the curse upon her as "the mirror crack'd from side to side". She leaves the tower to take a boat across the river, but meets her death before she reaches Camelot.

  The poem begins with the act of looking in a mirror, and the act of noticing the passage of time – which operate exactly as a memento mori: the medieval tradition of contemplating one's own mortality. The poem turns from that and ends with a model of creative productivity through observation, contemplation and writing — in a collaboration of the poet's offices and the mind's imprint on the young man. George Steevens and Edmond Malone consider the poem may be referring to the gift of a blank-book or book of tablets, perhaps given to the young man. Edward Dowden hypothesized that the poem relates to the Rival Poet: knowing that he has lost favor, the speaker makes a present of this blank book

 Out flew the web and floated wide- ; The mirror crack'd from side to side; ; "The curse is come upon me," cried ; The Lady of Shalott. He said, "She has a lovely face; ; God in his mercy lend her grace, ; The Lady of Shalott." The title comes from the poem The Lady of Shalott by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The Lady of Shalott weaves in a tower near Camelot and may only see the outside world reflected in a mirror. She will be doomed if she looks directly; when Lancelot appears, she looks directly at him and Camelot and the mirror cracks. This poem is referred to several times in the novel, with these lines quoted:  At the end, Miss Marple quotes the last three lines in referring to the dead actress:

 Sometimes you see a man ; With such irresistible cheekbones ; You feel an urge to raise your hand ; And touch them ; Simply to know how they feel ; To your skin. ; And then he looks full in your face ; And dazzles you with a reckless, innocent smile, ; Not of invitation, merely inviting. And then, ; All those years of prudent upbringing, ; Your religion, your values, ; The stern concern of your father ; The hushed chiding of your mother, ; The sour wisdom of generations ; The hardened core of civilisations ; Rise in indignation within you And quash the cave-woman ; Mercilessly ; So that you give him ; A grim, ladylike glare ; And turn your face away in disgust. And then, ; The next day you take care ; Without really thinking why, ; Not to get into the same bus.

  metaphorical, not references to actual objects, but metaphors for observation, time and the act of writing. Sonnet 77 is the midpoint in the sequence of 154 sonnets. The fact that it is about a mirror may be relevant to its placing. Edmund Spenser mentions mirrors at the midpoint of his sequence, Amoretti, Sonnet 45 of 89: "Leaue lady in your glasse of christall clene, / Your goodly selfe for euermore to vew". The original quarto's "blacks" in line 10 is usually emended to "blanks", following Alexander Dyce. Some critics have defended "blacks" as referring to printer's type, or to slate notebooks. If it refers to printers type it allows the reference to the quarto itself as a gift to the young man.

['The legendary Jerry Lee Lewis, known as "The Killer," is an American singer-songwriter and pianist, often known as one of the most significant figures of the golden age of rock and roll. Born in Ferriday, Louisiana, in 1935, Lewis began his career in the 1950s, and his first hit, "Crazy Arms," was released in 1956. However, it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin\' Goin\' On" that propelled him to fame and established him as a major force in the music industry.\n\nLewis\'s unique style, which combined elements of country, rock, and blues, set him apart from his contemporaries. He was known for his high-energy performances, which often included wild piano playing and acrobatic dance moves. Some of his most popular songs include "Great Balls of Fire," "Breathless," and "High School Confidential."\n\nIn addition to his musical achievements, Lewis\'s personal life has been the subject of much controversy. He was married to his first cousin, Myra Gale Brown, when she was just 13 years old, and the marriage was annulled in 1958. Lewis\'s reputation as a wild and unpredictable performer has also been well-documented, with stories of his onstage ant', 'who sang rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu']

  Gary Lewis is the son of Jerry Lewis and singer Patti Palmer. His mother, who was performing at the time with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra, intended to name him after her favorite actor, Cary Grant, but her son became "Gary" as the result of a clerical error. He received a set of drums as a gift for his 14th birthday in 1960. When he was 18, Lewis formed the band "Gary and the Playboys" with four friends. Joking at the lateness of bandmates to practice, Lewis referred to them as "playboys", and the name stuck. Lewis was the drummer, but the group was fronted by singer-guitarist Dave

  reach that chart's top 10. In addition to "This Diamond Ring", his hits include "Count Me In," the only non-British Commonwealth record in the Hot 100's top 10 on May 8, 1965, (number two); "Save Your Heart for Me" (number two); "Everybody Loves a Clown" (number four); "She's Just My Style" (number three); "Sure Gonna Miss Her" (number nine); and "Green Grass" (number eight). Of "Everybody Loves a Clown", Lewis says he composed the song as a gift for his father's birthday. He believed the song was too good, so instead of giving it as a gift, he recorded it. By 1966, Lewis was exclusively singing, replaced on the drums by, among others, Jim Keltner. His career was put on hold when he entered the U.S. Army as a

  Lewis attended Ysgol y Creuddyn in Conwy, where he formed a cover band called Bluewood. He participated in Cân i Gymru in 2007, the 38th edition of the competition. He came second in the competition with the song Llosgi (Burning), jointly composed by Lewis and Arwel Lloyd Owen. In 2007, Lewis released his first Welsh language EP entitled Byw Mewn Breuddwyd. Lewis appeared at the Wakestock Festival, alongside Mark Ronson, and at the inaugural Sŵn Festival in Cardiff. In June 2009, Lewis released his first Welsh language album, Sawl Ffordd Allan, reaching number one in the C2 Radio Cymru Welsh language chart, and

  Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on the Lewis name, Garrett put the band into the studio to develop, still financed by Gary's mother. Garrett pushed Lewis to improve his drumming skill, even getting Buddy Rich to tutor him, and, more importantly, made Lewis the singer, and therefore the focal point of the group. By Lewis' own admission, his natural singing voice was not one of his strengths, and Garrett employed overdubbing techniques in the studio to enhance it. "This Diamond Ring" hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 20, 1965, making Lewis an instant star. Lewis was Cash Box magazine's 1965 "Male Vocalist of the Year". Besides The Lovin' Spoonful, the group was the only artist during the 1960s to have its first seven Hot 100 releases

In April 1963, Lewis recorded his solo single "Baby I Dig Love" along with the B-side "I've Loved You So Long". The record was released the following month, but never reached the charts. He was a member of the Drifters from late 1960 until his untimely death in 1964. In 1988, Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Drifters.

  The album featured Lewis's hit "High School Confidential", but producer Sam Phillips did not include Lewis's bigger hits such as "Great Balls of Fire" and "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On." The album is sometimes referred to as High School Confidential. The back cover of the LP feature a large picture of Sun Records President Sam Phillips admiring Lewis at the piano in the famous studio at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee.

  Royal Fly-GH was founded as Fly540 Ghana, a subsidiary of Fly540, on 11 November 2008. It began operations in November 2011, flying to Accra, Tamale, Kumasi, and Takoradi. In June 2012, Fly540 and its subsidiaries were acquired by Rubicon Diversified Investments, which intended to absorb the airlines into its new venture Fastjet. However, in May 2014 Fastjet decided to suspend Fly540 Ghana's operations, as it needed to transition the airline's full-service model to Fastjet's low-cost one. In addition, Fastjet then sold off Fly540 Ghana's fleet, a single ATR 72-500. In June 2015, Fastjet sold Fly540 Ghana to DWG-G Co Ltd for only USD1.00. Within a week of the decision, the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) announced the airline would be rebranded as Royal Fly-GH and would soon resume operations. The resumption of service was expected to occur in October 2015, and then was thought to have been possible by the third quarter of 2016. However, Citi Business News reported in June 2016 that the resumption might be delayed as Royal Fly-GH had yet to complete the processes for further clearance from the GCAA.

['Malt whisky is made by distilling the grain barley. The process of making malt whisky involves several steps, including malting, mashing, fermentation, and distillation. During the malting process, the barley is soaked in water and then allowed to germinate, which converts the starches in the grain into sugars. The resulting malt is then dried and ground into a fine flour, known as grist. The grist is then mixed with hot water in a process called mashing, which releases the sugars from the grist. The resulting liquid, known as wort, is then fermented with yeast, which converts the sugars into alcohol. The resulting liquid, known as wash, is then distilled twice to produce malt whisky. The first distillation, known as the wash still, produces a low-wine spirit, which is then redistilled in a second still, known as the spirit still, to produce the final malt whisky. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels for several years, which adds flavor and complexity to the whisky. Malt whisky is typically aged for at least three years, but can be aged for up to several decades, depending on the desired flavor profile. The aging process also allows the whisky to develop a smooth and mellow character, which is a hallmark of high-quality malt whisky.', 'Malt whisky is made by distilling which grain?']

  The standard blend is 40% ABV. The blend goes through a marrying process for up to six months at 46% ABV. It is known that in order to call a whisky "Blended Scotch", the youngest malt in the blend needs to be matured for at least three years. However, they do not state how old the youngest malt in their blend is. Rather, they optimize the standard taste by blending casks of varying ages among batches. The aging is done in oak casks.

This process purifies it and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly known as alcohol by volume, ABV). As distilled drinks contain more alcohol they are considered "harder" - in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones, which are implicitly weaker.

During this period, Stewart and James Chivas decided to respond to their affluent customers' demands for better whisky, by blending select malts to create a proprietary blend. The firm's first blended Malt Scotch whisky, the Royal Glen Dee, was launched in 1854. Stewart left in 1857, making way for John and the company could now be named Chivas Brothers. In 1863, they launched a proprietary Blended Scotch whisky, a smoothly crafted blend of 10 year old malt and grain Whiskies, Royal Strathythan. The May 8, 1890, edition of Scotland Magazine described Chivas Brothers as "undoubtedly the finest purveying business in the north of Scotland".

  Deanston Distillery looks very unlike a traditional Scotch whisky distillery and has a number of unique production features which contribute to its distinct character in taste and look. The spirit is handmade by a small team of local craftsmen who rely on traditional distilling techniques; no technology or computers are used. Deanston uses only Scottish-grown barley and in 2000, was one of the first distilleries in Scotland to start producing organic whisky, certified by the Organic Food Federation and using barley grown in specially selected sites, free from pesticides and chemicals. The distillery also uses an 11-ton open-topped mash tun - the only one of its size in Scotland - and four unique pot stills with upwards sloping lyne arms and boiling balls, which help give the whisky its light character. The spirit is matured in the original weaving shed built in the 1830s, which holds a capacity of 45,000 casks.

  Barley, yeast, and water are the only ingredients required in the production of (barley-based) single malt whisky. The barley used to make the whisky is "malted" by soaking the grain in water for two to three days and allowing it to germinate. This process releases enzymes, which convert unfermentable starch (which is insoluble in water and not available for fermentation by yeast) to fermentable sugars. Traditionally in Scotland, each distillery had its own malting floor where the germinating seeds were regularly turned. The "pagoda roof" (many now false) which ventilated the malt kiln can still be seen at many distilleries both in Scotland and in other countries. However, most of the distilleries now use commercial "maltsters" to prepare their malt.

Hot water (known as "liquor" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are then washed in a process known as "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible.

According to an ESPN article, "His leadership of the Marshals Service included early decisions in the attempt to arrest Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, the greatest disaster in the history of federal law enforcement, a fiasco that led to a grand jury investigation (Hudson was called to testify) and misconduct charges against 12 federal agents." According to a Congressional report on the Ruby Ridge incident, "based on his desire to avoid creating discoverable documents that might be used by the defense in the Weaver/Harris trial and his understanding that the FBI would conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident, [Hudson] decided to conduct no formal internal review of USMS activities connected with the Weaver case and the Ruby Ridge incident."

The United States Senate confirmed the nomination on March 3, 1801, and Marshall received his commission the same day. However, President Adams had already lost the election for a second term, so these nominations became controversial and the Judiciary Act of 1801 (a/k/a the "Midnight Judges Act") was repealed by the Judiciary Act of 1802 following the inauguration of President Adams' opponent as President Thomas Jefferson. Marshall's brother also failed to deliver some of the commissions, which led to the famous Supreme Court case of Marbury v. Madison. Meanwhile, this Judge Marshall resigned and his federal judicial service terminated on November 16, 1803.

  The federal court system in the United States is organized into 94 federal judicial districts, each with a court (and one or several judges), a United States Attorney with assistants such as prosecutors and government lawyers, and one marshal, appointed by the president, in charge of federal law enforcement. The courts are part of the independent judicial branch of the government, while the marshals and U.S. attorneys are part of the Department of Justice in the executive branch. In actual practice, the U.S. marshal for the district primarily oversees court security, and has a unit of appointed deputies and special deputies. (Other law enforcement operations and the federal prison system are handled by a variety of federal police agencies.) The United States Marshals Service is a professional, civil service unit of federal police, part of the system of marshals, made up of career law enforcement personnel rather than the appointed district marshals. The U.S. Marshals Service assists with court security and prisoner transport, asset forfeiture, serves arrest warrants and seeks fugitives.

 1 -8.29703  The federal court system in the United States is organized into 94 federal judicial districts, each with a court (and one or several judges), a United States Attorney with assistants such as prosecutors and government lawyers, and one marshal, appointed by the president, in charge of federal law enforcement. The courts are part of the independent judicial branch of the government, while the marshals and U.S. attorneys are part of the Department of Justice in the executive branch. In actual practice, the U.S. marshal for the district primarily oversees court security, and has a unit of appointed deputies and special deputies. (Other law enforcement operations and the federal prison system are handled by a variety of federal police agencies.) The United States Marshals Service is a professional, civil service unit of federal police, part of the system of marshals, made up of career law enforcement personnel rather than the appointed district marshals. The U.S. Marshals Service assists with court security and prisoner transport, asset forfeiture, serves arrest warrants and seeks fugitives.

The devices are operated out of at least five U.S. airports, "covering most of the U.S. population". It is unclear whether the U.S. Marshals Service requests court orders to use the devices. The Marshals Service has used dirtboxes in the Mexican Drug War, tracking fugitives in coordination with Mexico's Naval Infantry Force and flights in Guatemala. Dirtboxes are also used by the United States Special Operations Command, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. According to procurement documents, the U.S. Navy bought dirtboxes to mount on drones at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, its research and development facility in Southern California. The Pentagon Washington Headquarters Services bought dirtboxes in 2011.

The following year, this force was officially named the Bureau of Investigation by Attorney General George W. Wickersham. In 1935, the bureau adopted its current name. ; Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) – the Three Prisons Act of 1891 created the federal prison system.

  The librettist Alan Jay Lerner and the composer Frederick (Fritz) Loewe collaborated on a succession of musicals, beginning in 1942. Their first three shows were unsuccessful, but Brigadoon in 1947 and Paint Your Wagon in 1951 fared better. In 1956 the collaborators triumphed with My Fair Lady, their musical version of Shaw's Pygmalion, which broke the Broadway record for longest-running show. Their MGM musical Gigi became the most honored film musical ever, winning nine Academy Awards, including Lerner's Oscar for best screenplay and both partners' award for the title song. The partners' last collaboration was Camelot (1960).

  "On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)" is a song written by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics) for the 1965 musical On a Clear Day You Can See Forever. It was subsequently performed by American actress and vocalist Barbra Streisand in the 1970 film adaptation of the musical. Three variations of the song appear in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack album produced by Wally Gold: the initial version sung by co-star Yves Montand, a reprise version sung by Streisand, and an orchestral version performed alongside a live chorus. The Streisand rendition was released by Columbia Records as a promotional single on 7" vinyl (with a stereo mix on one side and mono on the other) in July 1970. The track received positive reviews from music critics, with many of them listing it as a highlight of the soundtrack.

  "On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)" was introduced by John Cullum in the 1965 Broadway musical of the same name. It was subsequently used in the 1970 film adaptation of the musical, in which Streisand appears as the main character. The song was recorded in early 1970 while filming the movie at Samuel Goldwyn Studios in West Hollywood, California. Three versions of the song are used in the film, and all appear on the accompanying soundtrack album. The song is initially performed in the film by Streisand's co-star Yves Montand, whereas the reprise version is sung by Streisand and the orchestral version is performed with a live chorus. The reprise rendition was released as a promotional single on 7" vinyl in July 1970 by Columbia Records.

  Frederick Loewe (, originally German Friedrich (Fritz) Löwe ; June 10, 1901 – February 14, 1988 ) was an Austrian-American composer. He collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on a series of Broadway musicals, including Brigadoon, Paint Your Wagon, My Fair Lady, and Camelot, all of which were made into films, as well as the original film musical Gigi (1958), which was first transferred to the stage in 1973.

Most biographers blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as Neil Simon did with Mike Nichols or Stephen Sondheim with Harold Prince.

In that same year Lerner also wrote the Oscar-winning original screenplay for An American in Paris, produced by Arthur Freed and directed by Vincente Minnelli.

  A military democracy is a war-based society that practices democracy. The category is often applied to historical peoples. An example is Frederick Engels' characterization: "The military commander, the council, and the popular assembly formed the organs of military democracy, military because war and the organization of war were now the regular functions of life of the people. The wealth of their neighbors excited the greed of the peoples, who began to regard acquisition of wealth as one of the main purposes in life. They were barbarians: plunder appeared to them easier and even more honorable than productive work. War, once waged

  Benedek was a staunch believer in the concept that the army was the chief guardian of the Habsburg monarchy and needed to protect it from liberal and nationalist forces; loyalty to the dynasty and monarch were paramount and suspicion of the civilian professional and business classes followed. In a circular to his officers in March 1861 he warned against "international revolutionaries, lawyers and doctors without practices, ambitious and money-hungry journalists, dissatisfied professors and schoolteachers" as well as "debt-ridden nobles and cowardly magnates" who threatened the monarchy. A year later he further stated in Verona that the army's purpose was "to serve, fight, and if necessary die with honor for the emperor and supreme warlord." Benedek believed in a traditional concept of war where valor and courage were of chief importance, where "simple rules" were superior to "complicated calculations". Following in this vein, he opposed the notion of a national, Prussian-style general staff of officers selected for their education and intellect.

 — Baron De Jomini Military geography is a sub-field of geography that is used by the military, as well as academics and politicians, to understand the geopolitical sphere through the military lens. To accomplish these ends, military geographers consider topics from geopolitics to physical locations’ influences on military operations and the cultural and economic impacts of a military presence. On a tactical level, a military geographer might put together the terrain and the drainage system below the surface, so a unit is not at a disadvantage if the enemy uses the drainage system to ambush it, especially in urban warfare. On a strategic level, an emerging field of strategic and military geography seeks to understand the changing

Reid's in-depth descriptions of Lobos early in the novel are reflective of his time in Mexico. The poignancy with which he describes the natural setting and the shifts in climate suggest he relayed similar information back to the United States while simultaneously working as a wartime correspondent for the New York newspaper, Spirit of the Times. An article from the Spirit from May 1850 states, "While campaigning in the south of [Mexico] his mind was forcibly impressed with its wild and picturesque scenery, as well as by a thousand interesting peculiarities in the character, costumes, and customs of its inhabitants." Reid's participation in the siege of Vera Cruz also explains the profound recollection Cpt. Haller has as the city is being destroyed in the novel. Reid resigned his position in 1848 after suffering a wound at the Battle of Chapultapec, which explains Cpt. Haller's return to New Orleans at the end of the war.

  Citizenship is a relationship between an individual and a state to which the individual owes allegiance and in turn is entitled to its protection. (quoted) Each state determines the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. Recognition by a state as a citizen generally carries with it recognition of civil, political, and social rights which are not afforded to non-citizens. In general, the basic rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country and to work there. Some countries permit their citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless, while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.

Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit.

['In the classroom, the interaction between teacher and students creates a zone of proximal development, a concept introduced by Vygotsky. This zone is the distance between the level of performance a learner can achieve without assistance and the level of performance they can achieve with the assistance of a more capable peer or teacher. In this zone, the teacher provides guidance and support to help the student reach a level of understanding that they would not be able to achieve on their own. This guidance can take many forms, including modeling, questioning, and scaffolding.\n\nModeling involves the teacher demonstrating a skill or concept to the students. This can be done through a lecture, a demonstration, or a video. The teacher models the skill or concept, and then the students practice it themselves.\n\nQuestioning involves the teacher asking questions to help students think critically and problem-solve. This can be done through open-ended questions, which encourage students to think deeply about a topic, or through closed-ended questions, which help students clarify their understanding of a concept.\n\nScaffolding involves the teacher providing support and guidance to help students reach a level of understanding that they would not be able to achieve on their own. This can be done through providing hints, asking leading questions, or breaking a task into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nIn addition to these strategies, the teacher can also provide feedback to help students improve their understanding of a concept', 'the interaction between teacher and students creates a zone of proximal']

Inquiry-based learning is generally used in field-work, case studies, investigations, individual and group projects, and research projects. ; Peer-Based Evaluation: In peer based evaluation students are given the opportunity to analyze, critique, and provide constructive feedback on the assignments of their peers.

  Constructivist psychology when applied to education emphasizes that students are always engaged in a process of actively constructing meaning—a process which "the teacher can only facilitate or thwart, but not himself invent". Jean Piaget's theory describes how children do not simply mimic everything that is part of the external environment, but rather that developing and learning is an ongoing process and interchange between individuals and their surroundings, a process through which individuals develop increasingly complex schemas. According to Angela O'Donnell and colleagues, constructivism describes how a learner constructs knowledge via different concepts: complex cognition, scaffolding, vicarious experiences, modeling, and observational learning. This makes students, teachers, the environment and anyone or anything else in which the student has interaction active participants in their learning.

  Collaborative pedagogy stems from the process theory of rhetoric and composition. Collaborative pedagogy believes that students will better engage with writing, critical thinking, and revision if they engage with others. Collaborative pedagogy pushes back against the Current-Traditional model of writing, as well as other earlier theories explaining rhetoric and composition; earlier theories of writing, especially current-traditional, emphasizes writing as a final product (completed individually). In contrast, collaborative pedagogy rejects the notion that students think, learn, and write in isolation. Collaborative pedagogy strives to maximize critical thinking, learning, and writing skills through interaction and interpersonal engagement. Collaborative pedagogy also connects to the broader theory of collaborative learning, which

  Teachers can also identify open areas outside of the classroom that could work for activities and group work (such as the schoolyard). In addition to open spaces, a quiet area where the teacher can speak directly to students one-to-one allows for debriefing of behavioural issues and for students to feel safe to discuss sensitive issues, away from the other students.  Teachers should adopt participatory teaching methods to allow students to benefit from active learning and practical activities. Using role-playing and the creative arts can assist students to understand and appreciate different experiences and points of view. These methods develop learning outcomes such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

  Instructional scaffolding is the support given to a student by an instructor throughout the learning process. This support is specifically tailored to each student; this instructional approach allows students to experience student-centered learning, which tends to facilitate more efficient learning than teacher-centered learning. This learning process promotes a deeper level of learning than many other common teaching strategies. Instructional scaffolding provides sufficient support to promote learning when concepts and skills are being first introduced to students. These supports may include resource, compelling task, templates and guides, and/or guidance on the development of cognitive and social skills. Instructional scaffolding could be employed through modeling a task, giving advice, and/or providing coaching. These supports are gradually removed as students develop autonomous learning strategies, thus promoting their own cognitive, affective and psychomotor learning skills and knowledge. Teachers help the students master a task or a concept by providing support. The support can take many forms such as outlines, recommended documents, storyboards, or key questions.

 The key components of Gagne's nine events of instruction for teaching dental students local anesthesia application techniques are as follows:

1. Gaining attention: Capture the students' attention and create a positive learning environment by using attention-grabbing strategies such as presenting a challenging or interesting scenario related to local anesthesia application.

2. Defining learning objectives: Clearly state the specific learning objectives that the students are expected to achieve during the session. This helps set the direction and purpose of the learning experience.

3. Stimulating recall of prerequisite learning: Activate the students' prior knowledge and help them recall the relevant information they have learned previously related to local anesthesia application techniques. This helps build upon their existing knowledge.

4. Presenting the stimulus material: Introduce the instructional material and present it to the students in a clear and organized manner. This may include lectures, demonstrations, videos, or interactive multimedia.

5. Providing learning guidance: Offer support and guidance to the students as they engage with the instructional material. This can include providing explanations, answering questions, and offering additional resources for further understanding.

6. Practice: Provide opportunities for the students to practice the local anesthesia application techniques. This can involve hands-on practice with dental mannequins, simulation models, or supervised clinical practice on patients.

7. Providing feedback: Offer constructive feedback to the students regarding their performance during the practice sessions. Feedback helps them understand their strengths and areas for improvement.

8. Assessing performance: Evaluate the students' performance to determine if they have achieved the desired level of proficiency in local anesthesia application techniques. This can be done through written exams, practical assessments, or clinical evaluations.

9. Enhancing retention and transfer: Reinforce the students' learning by providing opportunities for them to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in different contexts. This can be done through case studies, patient simulations, or real patient encounters.

Peyton's four-step approach for teaching dental students the local anesthesia application techniques includes:

1. Demonstration: The instructor demonstrates the correct technique of local anesthesia application, highlighting key steps and important considerations.

2. Deconstruction: The instructor breaks down the procedure into smaller components or steps, explaining each step in detail. This helps the students understand the underlying concepts and rationale behind each step.

3. Explanation: The instructor provides a thorough explanation of the principles, theories, and scientific background related to local anesthesia application. This helps students develop a deeper understanding of the technique.

4. Performance: The students are given the opportunity to practice and perform the local anesthesia application technique themselves under the supervision and guidance of the instructor. This hands-on practice allows them to develop their skills and gain confidence in the application technique.

By incorporating both Gagne's nine events of instruction and Peyton's four-step approach, dental educators can create a comprehensive and effective teaching plan for dental students to master local anesthesia application techniques.

 The role of a tutor is to provide academic support to students by offering personalized instruction and guidance in specific subject areas or skills. A tutor is typically an expert teacher who possesses deep knowledge or expertise in a particular subject or set of subjects. They work closely with students on a one-on-one basis, spending dedicated time with them on a regular basis, whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly.

Tutors can provide academic support in various settings, such as private tutoring centers, schools, universities, or even online platforms. Their primary goal is to help students improve their understanding and performance in the subject matter they are seeking assistance with.

Tutors tailor their teaching methods and strategies to suit the individual needs of each student. They may use different instructional techniques, such as explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, providing additional practice materials, offering step-by-step guidance through problem-solving processes, and giving constructive feedback on assignments or assessments.

In addition to helping students grasp challenging concepts and improve their academic performance, tutors also play a crucial role in building students' confidence and motivation. By providing personalized attention and support, tutors create a supportive learning environment that encourages students to ask questions, engage actively in the learning process, and develop effective study habits.

Overall, tutors serve as mentors and guides for students seeking extra help outside of the traditional classroom setting. Through their expertise and dedication to individualized instruction, tutors can significantly contribute to a student's academic success and overall educational experience.

 The Socratic method of teaching is a pedagogical approach that focuses on stimulating critical thinking and promoting active learning. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts.

Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments.

Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently.

While the Socratic method is commonly associated with dialogues, it can be adapted to various settings, such as classroom discussions, group activities, or even one-on-one interactions. This teaching approach is widely employed in fields such as law, philosophy, and education, as it nurtures a deeper understanding and helps students become more proficient in analytical thinking and problem-solving.

In conclusion, the Socratic method of teaching is an interactive and inquiry-based approach that challenges students to think critically and actively participate in the learning process. By asking thought-provoking questions, teachers promote analytical reasoning, foster intellectual growth, and facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

  children found the answers and explanations inadequate for their understanding, and as a result, they begin to create their own theories, particularly evident in children's understanding of religion. This theory also plays a part in Vygotsky's social learning theory, also called modeling. Vygotsky claims that humans, as social beings, learn and develop by observing others' behavior and imitating them. In this process of social learning, prior to imitation, children will first post inquiries and investigate why adults act and behave in a particular way. Afterwards, if the adult succeeds at the task, the child will likely copy the adult, but if the adult fails, the child will choose not to follow the example.

 1 2.67665 The key components of Gagne's nine events of instruction for teaching dental students local anesthesia application techniques are as follows:

1. Gaining attention: Capture the students' attention and create a positive learning environment by using attention-grabbing strategies such as presenting a challenging or interesting scenario related to local anesthesia application.

2. Defining learning objectives: Clearly state the specific learning objectives that the students are expected to achieve during the session. This helps set the direction and purpose of the learning experience.

3. Stimulating recall of prerequisite learning: Activate the students' prior knowledge and help them recall the relevant information they have learned previously related to local anesthesia application techniques. This helps build upon their existing knowledge.

4. Presenting the stimulus material: Introduce the instructional material and present it to the students in a clear and organized manner. This may include lectures, demonstrations, videos, or interactive multimedia.

5. Providing learning guidance: Offer support and guidance to the students as they engage with the instructional material. This can include providing explanations, answering questions, and offering additional resources for further understanding.

6. Practice: Provide opportunities for the students to practice the local anesthesia application techniques. This can involve hands-on practice with dental mannequins, simulation models, or supervised clinical practice on patients.

7. Providing feedback: Offer constructive feedback to the students regarding their performance during the practice sessions. Feedback helps them understand their strengths and areas for improvement.

8. Assessing performance: Evaluate the students' performance to determine if they have achieved the desired level of proficiency in local anesthesia application techniques. This can be done through written exams, practical assessments, or clinical evaluations.

9. Enhancing retention and transfer: Reinforce the students' learning by providing opportunities for them to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in different contexts. This can be done through case studies, patient simulations, or real patient encounters.

Peyton's four-step approach for teaching dental students the local anesthesia application techniques includes:

1. Demonstration: The instructor demonstrates the correct technique of local anesthesia application, highlighting key steps and important considerations.

2. Deconstruction: The instructor breaks down the procedure into smaller components or steps, explaining each step in detail. This helps the students understand the underlying concepts and rationale behind each step.

3. Explanation: The instructor provides a thorough explanation of the principles, theories, and scientific background related to local anesthesia application. This helps students develop a deeper understanding of the technique.

4. Performance: The students are given the opportunity to practice and perform the local anesthesia application technique themselves under the supervision and guidance of the instructor. This hands-on practice allows them to develop their skills and gain confidence in the application technique.

By incorporating both Gagne's nine events of instruction and Peyton's four-step approach, dental educators can create a comprehensive and effective teaching plan for dental students to master local anesthesia application techniques.
 2 -1.97963 The Socratic method of teaching is a pedagogical approach that focuses on stimulating critical thinking and promoting active learning. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, this method involves a teacher asking questions to prompt students to reflect, reason, and articulate their thoughts.

Instead of simply providing answers, the Socratic method encourages students to actively engage in the learning process and develop their intellectual abilities. The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding the conversation and challenging students to analyze their assumptions, compare different viewpoints, and defend their arguments.

Through this method, students are encouraged to think deeply about complex concepts, consider alternative perspectives, and actively participate in their own learning. By fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging the exploration of ideas, the Socratic method aims to enhance students' understanding, promote intellectual growth, and develop their ability to think more independently.

 3 -4.26560 The role of a tutor is to provide academic support to students by offering personalized instruction and guidance in specific subject areas or skills. A tutor is typically an expert teacher who possesses deep knowledge or expertise in a particular subject or set of subjects. They work closely with students on a one-on-one basis, spending dedicated time with them on a regular basis, whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly.

Tutors can provide academic support in various settings, such as private tutoring centers, schools, universities, or even online platforms. Their primary goal is to help students improve their understanding and performance in the subject matter they are seeking assistance with.

Tutors tailor their teaching methods and strategies to suit the individual needs of each student. They may use different instructional techniques, such as explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, providing additional practice materials, offering step-by-step guidance through problem-solving processes, and giving constructive feedback on assignments or assessments.

In addition to helping students grasp challenging concepts and improve their academic performance, tutors also play a crucial role in building students' confidence and motivation. By providing personalized attention and support, tutors create a supportive learning environment that encourages students to ask questions, engage actively in the learning process, and develop effective study habits.

Overall, tutors serve as mentors and guides for students seeking extra help outside of the traditional classroom setting. Through their expertise and dedication to individualized instruction, tutors can significantly contribute to a student's academic success and overall educational experience.

['Cain and Abel are two of the most significant figures in the Bible\'s Old Testament. They are the sons of Adam and Eve, and their story is recounted in the book of Genesis.\n\nCain was the firstborn son of Adam and Eve. He was a farmer, and he offered some of his produce as a sacrifice to God. Abel, on the other hand, was a shepherd, and he offered some of his sheep as a sacrifice. When God accepted Abel\'s sacrifice but rejected Cain\'s, Cain became angry and killed Abel.\n\nThe story of Cain and Abel is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the importance of faith and obedience to God. Cain\'s sacrifice was not accepted by God because it was not offered in faith. Abel\'s sacrifice, on the other hand, was accepted because it was offered in faith.\n\nSecondly, the story of Cain and Abel highlights the consequences of sin. Cain\'s anger and jealousy led him to commit murder, and as a result, he was cursed and forced to live a life of wandering.\n\nThirdly, the story of Cain and Abel highlights the importance of forgiveness. After Cain killed Abel, God asked him where Abel was. Cain responded, "I do not know. Am I my brother\'s keeper', 'who are cain and abel in the bible']

  Abel is a Biblical figure in the Book of Genesis within Abrahamic religions. He was the younger brother of Cain, and the younger son of Adam and Eve, the first couple in Biblical history. He was a shepherd who offered his firstborn flock up to God as an offering. God accepted his offering but not his brother's. Cain then killed Abel out of jealousy. According to Genesis, this was the first murder in the history of mankind.

  According to the narrative in Genesis, Abel (הֶבֶל Hébel, in pausa Hā́ḇel;  Hábel; هابيل, Hābīl) is Eve's second son. His name in Hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a root meaning "breath". Julius Wellhausen, have proposed that the name is independent of the root. Eberhard Schrader had previously put forward the Akkadian (Old Assyrian dialect) ablu ("son") as a more likely etymology. In Christianity, comparisons are sometimes made between the death of Abel and that of Jesus, the former thus seen as being the first martyr. In Jesus speaks of Abel as "righteous", and the Epistle to the Hebrews states

  "The blood of sprinkling ... [speaks] better things than that of Abel". The blood of Jesus is interpreted as bringing mercy; but that of Abel as demanding vengeance (hence the curse and mark). Abel is invoked in the litany for the dying in the Roman Catholic Church, and his sacrifice is mentioned in the Canon of the Mass along with those of Abraham and Melchizedek. The Alexandrian Rite commemorates him with a feast day on December 28. According to the Coptic Book of Adam and Eve (at 2:1–15), and the Syriac Cave of Treasures, Abel's body, after many days of mourning, was placed

  Though it is up for debate, it has been said that Eve went through 120 pregnancies with Adam and each of these consisted of a set of twins: a boy and a girl. In some other traditions, their first child was a girl, born alone, called ʿAnāq. According to several sources, God took all of Adam's progeny from his back while they were still in heaven. He asked each of them "am I not your lord?" as read in verse 7:172 and they all replied yes. For this reason, it is believed that all humans are born with an innate knowledge of God. The most famous of Adam's children are Cain and Abel. Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain. As Adam grieved his son, he would preach to his other children about God and faith in Him. When Adam's death grew near, he appointed his son Seth as his successor.

  Cain is a Biblical figure in the Book of Genesis within Abrahamic religions. He is the elder brother of Abel, and the firstborn son of Adam and Eve, the first couple within the Bible. He was a farmer who gave an offering of his crops to God. However, God was not pleased and favored Abel's offering over Cain's. Out of jealousy, Cain killed his brother, for which he was punished by God with the curse and mark of Cain. He had several children, starting with Enoch and including Lamech. The narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive for murdering his brother, God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, or details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and the first murderer.

  The Book of Genesis does not give a specific reason for the murder of Abel. Modern commentators typically assume that the motives were jealousy and anger due to God rejecting Cain's offering, while accepting Abel's. The First Epistle of John says the following: "Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous."" Ancient exegetes, such as the Midrash and the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, tell that the motive involved a desire for the most beautiful woman. According to Midrashic tradition, Cain and Abel each had twin sisters; each was to marry the other's. The Midrash states that Abel's promised wife, Aclima, was more beautiful than Awan, Cain's promised wife. And so, after Cain would not consent to this arrangement, Adam suggested seeking God's blessing by means of a sacrifice. Whoever God blessed would marry Aclima. When God openly rejected Cain's sacrifice, Cain slew his brother in a fit of jealousy and anger. Rabbinical exegetes have discussed whether Cain's incestuous relationship with his sister was in violation of halakha.

  According to Rashi, Tubal-cain's name literally means "Cain's-Spices", with the Hebrew word Tū́ḇal (תובל) deriving from the word Tū́ḇlin (תבלין) meaning spices. Rashi states that he was named this, because he "seasoned and improved the work of Cain". In other words, because he was a blacksmith, who helped to make weapons which could be used to kill more efficiently, he invokes his ancestor Cain's sin of murder. Furthermore according to Tanhuma bar Abba, one day, Tubal-cain and his father, Lamech, were hunting together with Tubal-cain serving as an aid for his blind father. In the distance is Cain who Lamech believes to be an animal. He checks with Tubal-cain to see if it is an animal, but Tubal-cain deceives his father, and lets him shoot and kill his forefather Cain, possibly because of Tubal-cain's blood lust. When Lamech realizes what he has done, he throws his hands up in a fit of mourning, accidentally killing his son Tubal-cain. However Genesis Rabbah disagrees with this narrative. In Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus says that "Tubal exceeded all men in strength, and was very expert and famous in martial performances, ... and first of all invented the art of working brass."

  The first character, Abel, performed an 'acceptable sacrifice', and died as a martyr. Abel's choice of superior quality of offering compared to Cain's second rate one (Philo, ''Sacr. AC 52, 57, 88) is related to the presence of "faith", which attests Abel to be "righteous" or "just" (Josephus, Antiq.'' 1.2.1 §53). Enoch 'pleased God' ( LXX version; Masoretic text: 'walked with God') and 'translated to heaven' according to Jewish tradition (such as Sirach 44:16; Philo, Mutat. 38; Josephus, Antiq. 1.85; 1 Enoch; 2 Enoch; 3 Enoch), indicating that having faith in God leads to the transcendence of death (cf. verses 4-6, 11-12, 17-19, 35). Noah believed in the 'unseen' event of divine judgment, and 'condemned' the world that didn't believe his preaching of repentance. The LXX version of introduces Noah both as "righteous" and "pleasing to God", thus connects naturally with "righteous" Abel and Enoch, who "pleased God".

Cain witnesses Abraham trying to save the two doomed cities, as recounted in the Bible, and getting God to agree to spare Sodom if there were even Ten Righteous People to be found there. Abraham finally concedes that there were none such, and that therefore God was right to pour fire and brimstone on the two cities and annihilate their inhabitants. However, Cain considers Abraham a gullible fool. In Cain's view, God was determined all along to destroy the two cities, had made no real effort to look for Righteous

  A question arising early in the story is why God rejected Cain's sacrifice. The text states that "In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor." Genesis 4:3-5a. Noteworthy is the difference in the type of sacrifice: fruits of the soil are renewable and bloodless. Fat-portions are set apart for the Lord [see Leviticus 3:16], and came from the firstborn - which point to an act of faith, since it is not

According to Midrashic tradition, Cain and Abel each had twin sisters; each was to marry the other's. The Midrash states that Abel's promised wife, Aclima, was more beautiful than Awan, Cain's promised wife. And so, after Cain would not consent to this arrangement, Adam suggested seeking God's blessing by means of a sacrifice. Whoever God blessed would marry Aclima. When God openly rejected Cain's sacrifice, Cain slew his brother in a fit of jealousy and anger. Rabbinical exegetes have discussed whether Cain's incestuous relationship with his sister was in violation of halakha.

["The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) is a yacht club based in Auckland, New Zealand. It was founded in 1871 and is the oldest continuously operating yacht club in New Zealand. The club is located in the suburb of Westhaven, on the waterfront of the Waitematā Harbour.\n\nThe club is best known for its role in organising the America's Cup, which it has hosted twice, in 1983 and 2003. The RNZYS won the America's Cup for the first time in 1995, when it was represented by the syndicate Team New Zealand. The club's second America's Cup victory came in 2003, when it was represented by the syndicate Alinghi, which was based in Switzerland.\n\nThe RNZYS has a long and proud history in yachting, and has produced many notable sailors over the years. Some of the most famous include Peter Blake, who skippered the New Zealand team in the 1983 America's Cup, and won the race in 1995; and Russell Coutts, who was the skipper of the Swiss team Alinghi in 2003, and won the America's Cup for the second time.\n\nThe club's current commodore", "When did the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron win its first America's Cup?"]

Although the New York Yacht Club yacht Constellation won the America's Cup off Newport, Rhode Island, Sovereign was much admired for her graceful lines and teak deck. In addition to the financial losses building the two RAF Pinnaces, the much anticipated work following the three high-profile 12-metre projects failed to materialize. The Robertson family finally sold the yard in 1965 for £27,750, and it became a subsidiary of the Auchinleck Investment Co of Glasgow (comprising a syndicate of 5 well-known Clyde yachtsmen), essentially ending wooden boat-building there.

  The America's Cup Match is always raced between two yachts from different countries. This means that any syndicate from the country of the defending yacht club would not be participating in the challenger series. The yacht club defending the America's Cup staged a series of races to select the yacht to defend and race against the challenger for the America's Cup. For many years a defender series had been a part of the defender selection process and in 1992 Citizen Watch offered the Citizen Cup to be awarded to the winner of the defender selection series. In parallel the challengers competed for the Louis Vuitton Cup and the winner went on to challenge for the America's Cup. The 1995 Citizen Cup regatta was won by the yacht Stars & Stripes, entered by the "Sail America" syndicate. The defending San Diego Yacht Club opted to have the crew of Stars & Stripes, skippered by Dennis Conner, use the second-place yacht Young America in the America's Cup Match against Challenger Black Magic representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. Young America had been entered by John Marshall's PACT95 syndicate. Black Magic won the 1995 America's Cup Match 5-0.

['The first Australian football competition was held in 1867, just two years after the formation of the first football club in Melbourne. The competition, known as the Victorian Football Association (VFA), was established by a group of prominent football enthusiasts who sought to promote the sport and establish a governing body for the game.\n\nThe inaugural season of the VFA saw eight teams compete for the championship, with the first match taking place on May 15, 1867. The teams that participated in the first season were:\n\n1. Melbourne Football Club\n2. South Melbourne Football Club\n3. Hotham Football Club\n4. Richmond Football Club\n5. Carlton Football Club\n6. Geelong Football Club\n7. Albert Park Football Club\n8. St Kilda Football Club\n\nThe first match of the season was played between Melbourne and Hotham, with Melbourne emerging as the victors. The season was a success, with the final being played between Melbourne and South Melbourne, with Melbourne winning the championship.\n\nThe VFA continued to grow in popularity, with more teams joining the competition in subsequent seasons. The competition eventually evolved into the Victorian Football League (VFL), which later became the Australian Football League (AFL), the premier football competition in Australia.\n\nToday, the VFA still exists as a lower-level competition, with teams from across Victoria competing for the championship.

  In 1896, delegates from six of the wealthiest VFA clubs—Carlton, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne and South Melbourne—met to discuss the formation of a breakaway professional competition. Later joined by Collingwood and St Kilda, the clubs formed the Victorian Football League (VFL), which held its inaugural season in 1897. The VFL's popularity grew rapidly as it made several innovations, such as instituting a finals system, reducing teams from 20 to 18 players, and introducing the behind as a score. Richmond and University joined the VFL in 1908, and by 1925, with the addition of Hawthorn, Footscray and North Melbourne, it had become the preeminent league in the country and would take a leading role in many aspects of the sport.

   Following Melbourne's lead, Geelong and Melbourne University also formed football clubs in 1859. While many early Victorian teams participated in one-off matches, most had not yet formed clubs for regular competition. A South Yarra side devised its own rules. To ensure the supremacy of the Melbourne rules, the first-club level competition in Australia, the Caledonian Society's Challenge Cup (1861–64), stipulated that only the Melbourne rules were to be used. This law was reinforced by the Athletic Sports Committee (ASC), which ran a variation of the Challenge Cup in 1865–66. With input from other clubs, the rules underwent several minor revisions, establishing a uniform code known as "Victorian rules". In 1866, the "first distinctively Victorian rule", the running bounce, was formalised at a meeting of club delegates chaired by H. C. A. Harrison, an influential pioneer who took up football in 1859 at the invitation of Wills, his cousin. The

  Then in 1912, Railway originally won the final by three points, but Yarraville successfully protested one of Railway's second quarter goals on the grounds of goal umpire error, and the match was reversed to a three-point Yarraville victory; as minor premier, Railway still had the right to challenge for the premiership, but refused as its own act of protest, forfeiting the premiership to Yarraville and almost being kicked out the association as a result. The VJFA eventually transitioned to become the VFA Second Eighteens during the 1920s. This began in 1924, when the competition expanded from twelve teams to eighteen in two divisions – one

  premiership. At its peak in the early 1890s when it was the only top junior football competition, more than twenty-five clubs competed, and from 1892 until 1894 the competition ran in two divisions to manage its numbers. The establishment of other junior football competitions – including the Victorian Second-Rate (1890), Third-Rate (1892) and Fourth-Rate (1893) Junior Football Associations and the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (1892) – saw numbers in the VJFA premiership decline rapidly through the 1890s, and by 1899 only seven clubs competed in the VJFA. Eight to twelve teams typically contested the premiership thereafter. The competition typically featured smaller clubs from districts already

  A rift in the VFA led to the formation of the Victorian Football League (VFL), which commenced play in 1897 as an eight-team breakaway of the stronger clubs in the VFA competition: Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne. The first season concluded with Essendon finishing as the premiers (winners). Another four VFA clubs joined the VFL later, as Richmond joined the VFL in 1908. Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne joined in 1925, by which time VFL had become the most prominent league in the game. University also joined the VFL in 1908 but left in 1915.

Four successful VJFA clubs from growing districts – West Melbourne, Preston, Northcote and Yarraville – ultimately went on to play senior football in the Victorian Football Association. In 1905, John Wren donated a silver shield to serve as a semi-perpetual trophy for the VJFA premiers; like many trophies of the era, it was held temporarily by the reigning premiers, then won permanently by the first team to win it three times. A total of five Wren Shields were awarded during the trophy's history. Strong rivalries resulted in some rough and controversial finals. Two notable finals

  James Munroe Aitken (15 May 1872 – 27 August 1944) was an Australian rules footballer who played in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Aitken was Carlton's inaugural VFL captain when the league formed for the 1897 season, replacing Tom Blake. He had been the club's vice-captain the previous season when they competed in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), and was elected captain before the start of the season, with a twelve to eight majority vote. After a disappointing run of form, just making the side to play against South Melbourne and Melbourne, he was left out of the team and replaced by Ernie Walton. Aitken left the Blues midway through the 1898 season and joined Melbourne. He played four games for Melbourne before leaving the game. He was the first player in the VFL to play senior premiership matches for two clubs in the same season.

["On August 11, 1997, Major League Baseball retired the number 42 in honor of Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in 1947. The ceremony took place at a game between the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers, where Robinson's former team retired his number in 1972. The league-wide retirement of the number was a historic moment, as it was the first time a number had been retired in honor of a player who was not a Hall of Famer.\n\nRobinson's impact on the game of baseball and society as a whole cannot be overstated. Born on January 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia, Robinson grew up in Pasadena, California, and attended UCLA. After serving in the Army during World War II, he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers and made his debut on April 15, 1947. Robinson faced intense prejudice and hostility from fans, players, and even his own teammates, but he persevered and became one of the greatest players in baseball history.\n\nIn his first season, Robinson hit .297 with 12 home runs and 31 stolen bases, and he was named the Rookie of the Year. He went on to win six consecutive batting titles and helped lead the Dodgers to six pennants", 'Every major league baseball team has retired the number 42, in honor of what player who was born on January 31, 1919?']

  On April 18, 1946 — opening day of the International League season — Robinson, the 26-year-old second baseman, took the field for the Montreal Royals against the Jersey City Giants, a Class AAA affiliate of the New York Giants, thus becoming the first African American player to break the baseball color line in the modern era of segregated professional baseball. The game took place at Jersey City's since-demolished Roosevelt Stadium (Droyer's Point at the foot of Danforth Avenue at Route 440). The Giants sold 52,000 tickets (more than double the stadium's capacity of 23,000). Robinson was heckled mercilessly during his first plate appearance, but went on to have four hits including a 3-run homer, with 4 RBI, 4 runs scored, and 2 stolen bases in Montreal's 14–1 win. A year later, Robinson would again break the color line when he debuted with the Major League Baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.

  On March 19, 2013, Entertainment Weekly announced that Shailene Woodley would play Hazel Grace Lancaster. Director Josh Boone said, "We read close to 150 actresses for the role, and I saw about 50 of those. Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. She held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them." On May 10, 2013, Ansel Elgort was cast as Hazel's love interest, Augustus Waters. On July 23, Laura Dern was cast as Hazel's mother Frannie Lancaster, and Nat Wolff as Issac, Augustus' best friend. Wolff told HuffPost Live, "It's exciting, I feel really lucky.

Anna Smith of Empire said it was a, "touching romance and Shailene Woodley's best performance yet." Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy wrote "The Fault in Our Stars is a sharp and emotionally-sophisticated weepie that imbues its teenage characters with rare intelligence, and tackles its bleak subject matter with acerbic wit and tenderness."

  The Fault in Our Stars premiered to 300 guests at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on June 2, 2014. At the premiere, Green said: "I didn't want to sell it, because Hollywood sucks at making unsentimental movies about illness." The film was released on June 6, 2014. After the New York premiere, Evangeline Earl, a student, announced that Green's book, from which the film was adapted, had been inspired by her sister Esther Earl, who had also been an author. Esther had thyroid cancer and died in 2010. Evangeline said Esther had met Green at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter convention held in Boston in 2009. Green said, "I could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without knowing Esther. Every word on that book depends on her." Green said he used the word "okay" in the book and the film because Hazel and Augustus used it to express their love for each other.

  Esther Earl inspired the character Hazel Grace Lancaster in Green's 2012 novel, The Fault in Our Stars, as well as its 2014 film adaptation. Shailene Woodley portrayed Lancaster in the novel's film adaptation. Although Earl inspired the novel and the character of Hazel Grace, the novel is not intended to be biographical. Green dedicated the novel to Esther but also found inspiration through others, including his son and wife, as well as his experience as a children's hospital chaplain. Green wrote on his Tumblr blog, "I don't want people conflating Esther with Hazel (they're very different), and it's extremely important to me that I not claim to be telling Esther's story."

['The Japanese word maru, which means "round" or "circle," is commonly used in martial arts to describe a technique that is executed in a circular motion. This technique is often used in striking and blocking maneuvers, as it allows for a more fluid and efficient movement. In karate, for example, the maru dachi stance is a basic position that involves standing with the feet shoulder-width apart and the toes pointing outward at a 45-degree angle. This stance allows for a strong and stable base, while also providing the flexibility to execute circular movements. In judo, the maru kaiten nage technique involves spinning the opponent around in a circular motion, which can be used to throw them off balance and gain control. Overall, the maru concept is an important part of Japanese martial arts, as it emphasizes the importance of circular movements and the use of the entire body in executing techniques.', 'what does the japanese word maru mean in english']

  Keijutsukai Aikido and Keijutsu (a specialized method of defensive tactics for law enforcement personnel), emphasize rational and practical approaches, incorporating the Principle of Compatibility; Circular (marui) and Proper Operational Distance (maai). Movements and techniques are taught to flow naturally without force. Maai (Proper Distance) and Marui (Circle) concepts are shared with other Aikido styles. To develop coordination and balance; to control movements with the hips, while maintaining a stabilized center of gravity at the lower half of the body are also important and fundamental concepts. The techniques consist in throws, locks, and the application of nerve pressure points designed to constantly keep an opponent off-balance and under control.

  More recently kata has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense, referring  to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practised to various levels of mastery. In Japanese language kata (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.” The goal of a painter's practising, for example, is to merge their consciousness with their brush; the potter's with their clay; the garden designer's with the materials of the garden. Once such mastery

  Kata is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning "form". It refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be practised alone. It can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training. It is practised in Japanese martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the movements being executed. Korean martial arts with Japanese influence (hapkido, Tang Soo Do) use the derived term hyeong (hanja: 形) and also the term pumsae (hanja: 品勢 hangeul: 품새). Kata are also used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like kabuki and schools of tea ceremony (chadō), but are most commonly known in the martial arts. Kata are used by most Japanese and Okinawan martial arts, such as iaido, judo, kendo, kenpo, and karate.

  closer fighting distances. Hapkido emphasizes circular motion, redirection of force, and control of the opponent. Practitioners seek to gain advantage over their opponents through footwork and body positioning to incorporate the use of leverage, avoiding the use of brute strength against brute strength. The art was adapted from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu as it was taught by Choi Yong-Sool (최용술) when he returned to Korea after World War II after having lived in Japan for 30 years. This system was later combined by Choi's disciples with kicking and striking techniques of indigenous and contemporary arts such as Taekkyon, and Tang Soo Do; as well as various throwing techniques and ground fighting from Japanese Judo.

  Also referred to as a round kick, this is the most commonly used kick in combat sports due to its power and ease of use. In most traditional martial arts, the instep is used to strike, whereas in Muay Thai, kickboxing and mixed martial arts the shin is used. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent MMA use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.

 Today more than ever, runners are aware of how weakness in the “core” of the body can negatively influence lower extremity biomechanics and running performance. The “core” is made up of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip region. Optimal core function involves both mobility and stability. When the core is functioning efficiently, advantageous length-tension relationships are maintained, which allow the runner to produce strong movements in the extremities. More importantly, proper core stability can help maximize running performance, maintain the center of gravity over the base of support, control lower extremity limb motion while running, and help prevent running-related injuries.
If injury occurs, a specific treatment strategy needs to be employed. More often than not, the old treatment prescription of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) is not sufficient to effectively treat, eliminate, and prevent running injuries. This is where Active Release Technique® (ART®) comes into play. A movement-based treatment for the soft tissues, this technique has become world renown in the elite running and triathlon crowds. ART® is unique in that it involves manipulation of the muscles, ligaments, fascia, tendons, and nerves using a manual contact. It is known for its ability to quickly improve tension and motion of the affected tissues and produce fast pain relief and performance improvement. Chiropractors often endorse this form of treatment because it is highly effective and stays consistent with the desire to treat the whole body.
Running injuries are typically chronic due to improper running biomechanics that result in the buildup of scar tissue. Over time, through the repetitive stress of training, the scar tissue becomes thicker and stronger. This can quickly lead to injury and performance deficits. ART® helps break up that scar tissue and restore normal function. By allowing the muscles to function more efficiently, the athlete becomes faster and gains stability.
Since endurance athletes hate to be sidelined, regular physical maintenance and injury prevention is an important aspect of the athletic lifestyle. Think of ART® as massage’s crazy cousin that works harder, faster, and more efficiently. ART® involves intense, active, movement-based massage treatments, which set it apart from passive massage techniques. There’s ample evidence to show that ART® promotes faster recovery, promotes restoration of normal tissue function, and prevents injury when compared to other forms of manual therapy.
There are more than 500 established treatment protocols for the entire body; however, ART® is anything but standard. It’s quite literally an art. Instead of treating a general area, the provider uses his hands to feel for abnormal or damaged tissue in muscle, fascia, tendons, ligaments, or nerves. Damaged tissue, namely scar tissue, has two causes: acute trauma, such as a tear or pull, and overuse or chronic injury, which is an accumulation of micro traumas, or small tears that occur repeatedly.
Abnormal tissue can go unnoticed by an athlete or it may manifest into injury. Symptoms of damaged tissue are tightening and shortening of the muscle. This impairs performance due to a loss of mobility, restricted range of motion, and loss of strength. Other side effects include poor biomechanics, overcompensation in other body parts, nerve entrapment, tendonitis, and lack of oxygen supply to an affected muscle.
Once the problem areas are exposed, the fun begins. The ART® provider applies intense and repetitive movement-based massage techniques to release the buildup of dense scar tissue, restore normal function, and decrease intense pain. Incorporating movement allows tissue to heal in the correct patterns. Still, every patient responds differently to ART®. Some heal quickly, while some experience soreness after treatments.
The glutes are necessary in every movement. They are a prime mover, propelling the body forward while stabilizing the back and hip during trunk and shoulder movements. The glutes are essential for good posture, lifting, walking, throwing, sitting, running, standing, squatting, lunging, climbing, and even sleeping. They are almost constantly in use.
Gluteus Maximus—The largest muscle of the body. Used for power, strength, and upright walking. When the g. max is weak, pain is often felt in the low back, anterior hip, and the calf/Achilles.
Gluteus Medius—The “rotator cuff” of the hip. Its main function is to provide lateral stability of the hip and knee. When it’s weak it will lead to Iliotibial band syndrome, medial knee pain, peroneal tendonitis, and plantar fasciitis.
Gluteus Minimus—Important for walking and used for balance stabilization. Problems with this muscle can lead to a limp, hip pain, knee pain, and loss of balance.
A complete running strategy includes more than getting into enough shape to run a specific race. Take a look at the athlete as a whole system. The athlete needs the correct fuel in the form of good nutrition. The athlete needs a sturdy foundation with a strong core musculature. The system needs to be coordinated properly by the brain and nervous system to provide balance and optimal proprioceptive feedback. The system has to be trained properly with the goal of peaking at just the right time to excel at the targeted endeavor. Finally, the system has to be maintained and occasionally overhauled to keep it healthy so that it can perform at a high level for a long time. An athlete is a high-performance machine that requires a lot of work, but has the potential to do some amazing things.

  Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (kata) rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the tori (取り), or shite (仕手) (depending on aikido style), also referred to as nage (投げ) (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique. Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are considered essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.

 There are several different types of massage techniques, each with their own specific benefits. Here are a few examples:

1. Deep Tissue Massage: This technique is focused on releasing chronic tension in specific areas of the body. It uses various muscle release techniques to target tense and painful areas, providing relief.

2. Hot Stone Massage: This ancient therapy involves using smooth, heated basalt river rocks and massage techniques to deeply relax the body. The warm stones help melt away tension and stress, promoting deep relaxation.

3. Swedish Massage: This classic massage technique uses long, flowing strokes to relieve muscle tension and improve circulation. It is a gentle and relaxing massage that helps you ease into a state of relaxation.

4. Myofascial Release: This specialized technique focuses on unlocking key areas of the body to allow the muscles and fascia to release and heal. It can decrease pain, improve flexibility, range of motion, posture, and create freedom of movement.

5. Neuromuscular Massage: This type of massage is often beneficial for injuries and chronic pain. It aims to soften the muscles, allowing the therapist to deeply work on breaking up adhesions. This can help free the body of spasm and pain, increase range of motion, and prevent further injuries.

6. Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD): This gentle massage technique is intended to encourage the natural drainage of lymph, which carries waste products away from the tissues. It uses specific pressure and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow, supporting the body's immune system and promoting detoxification.

7. Chair Massage: If you have limited time, you can enjoy a relaxing chair massage. This technique involves sitting in a custom-designed chair while your therapist focuses on massaging your back, neck, shoulders, and arms.

It's important to note that these are just a few examples of massage techniques, and there are many more out there. The specific benefits of each technique may vary, but overall, massages can help reduce stress, relieve muscle tension, improve circulation, promote relaxation, and support overall well-being.

Answer: 
2024-06-14 10:34:42 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:More often than not, the old treatment prescription of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) is not sufficient to effectively treat, eliminate, and prevent running injuries. ART® is unique in that it involves manipulation of the muscles, ligaments, fascia, tendons, and nerves using a manual contact. Since endurance athletes hate to be sidelined, regular physical maintenance and injury prevention is an important aspect of the athletic lifestyle. Think of ART® as massage’s crazy cousin that works harder, faster, and more efficiently. ART® involves intense, active, movement-based massage treatments, which set it apart from passive massage techniques. It’s quite literally an art. The glutes are essential for good posture, lifting, walking, throwing, sitting, running, standing, squatting, lunging, climbing, and even sleeping. They are almost constantly in use. Used for power, strength, and upright walking. Its main function is to provide lateral stability of the hip and knee. Finally, the system has to be maintained and occasionally overhauled to keep it healthy so that it can perform at a high level for a long time.

Ice skating: Motor skills are necessary for maintaining balance, executing turns, and performing jumps and spins on ice. 6. 7. Martial arts (such as Muay Thai): Martial arts require precise motor skills for striking, blocking, and dodging techniques. 8. 9. Cycling: Motor skills are needed for pedaling, maintaining balance, and controlling the bike at various speeds and terrains. 10. Dance: Various forms of dance, such as ballet or breakdancing, involve complex motor skills for precise movements, balance, and coordination. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the tori (取り), or shite (仕手) (depending on aikido style), also referred to as nage (投げ) (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique. Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are considered essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. Tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in

"Darvish...keeps you riveted throughout." "Darvish sustains the illusion right till the end in bravura fashion." The show moved to the Triad Theater (also in New York City) in January, 2004. Darvish has appeared on several television shows, including: Spin City, NYPD Blue, Law & Order, and most recently TV You Control: Bar Karma.

  Lewis, an older professional actor who is appearing in a West End production of Shakespeare's King John. Freddie’s is to provide two child actors who will play the young Prince Arthur in King John. Mattie Stewart will take the part at the start of the run, handing over to Jonathan Kemp later. Although a competent actor, Mattie struggles in the role, and his fear of heights makes it particularly difficult for him to be convincing in the scene in which he has to jump from the castle battlements to his death. Jonathan is the more naturally talented actor, and realises that if the scene is to be realistic he will have to practise the jump repeatedly.

  Over ten years of the Round Earth Theatre Company at Strahan, and work on Sarah Island as a guide, Davey's work has had significance in helping tourists understand the penal station and its context, where previously there had been scattered and not very accessible research. The Ship that Never Was, written by Davey, is Australia's longest-running play, with over 5,000 performances and continuing to be performed nightly at Strahan; it is about the Frederick escape, the successful escape of 10 convicts from Sarah Island to Chile. His book The Sarah Island Conspiracies: Being an account of twelve voyages to Macquarie Harbour and Sarah Island, which was short listed for a major prize in Hobart in 2005, complements the work of Richard Flanagan's Gould's Book of Fish. They both use the painting by William Buelow Gould of the Weedy sea dragon on the covers of their books. Davey's long lasting interest in Shakespeare's King Lear saw production in November 2007 of an adaptation The Madness of King Lear in Hobart, Tasmania. Davey died on 13 March 2013 after a long battle with illness.

  Carry On Cabby is a 1963 British comedy film, the seventh in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). Released on 7 November 1963, it was the first to have a screenplay written by Talbot Rothwell (although the first screenplay "Tolly" submitted to Peter Rogers was developed as Carry On Jack) from a story by Dick Hills and Sid Green (script writers for Morecambe and Wise). Regulars Sid James, Hattie Jacques, Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey are all present. Liz Fraser makes her third appearance (and last for more than a decade) and both Bill Owen and Esma Cannon make their final (and in both cases, fourth) appearances. This was the first film in the series to feature Carry On regular Jim Dale. Carry On Cabby was originally planned as a non-Carry On film, called Call Me A Cab (after a stage play) but midway through development it became part of the Carry On series. The film is notable from others in the series for its dramatic plotline of a troubled marriage.

  Carry On Cruising is a 1962 British comedy film, the sixth in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). It was based on an original story by Eric Barker. P&O – Orient Lines were thanked in the credits. Regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Kenneth Connor appear in the film, whereas Joan Sims and Charles Hawtrey do not. Sims took ill shortly before filming began and was replaced by Dilys Laye, making her Carry On debut, at four days' notice. Hawtrey was dropped for demanding star billing, but returned for the next entry, making this the only entry during Hawtrey's 23-film run which he missed. Sims returned two years later in Carry On Cleo. Liz Fraser notches up the second of her four appearances here. Lance Percival makes his only appearance in the series in Carry On Cruising, playing the ship's chef, the role originally designated for Hawtrey. The Australian actor Vincent Ball also makes his first, of two, Carry On appearances. This was the last film to have its screenplay written by Norman Hudis. This film was notable for being the first in the series to be filmed in colour.

  Carry On Up the Khyber is a 1968 British comedy film, the 16th in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). It stars Carry On regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Bernard Bresslaw and Peter Butterworth. It is the second of two Carry On film appearances by Wanda Ventham; and Roy Castle makes his only Carry On appearance, in the romantic male lead part usually played by Jim Dale. Angela Douglas makes her fourth and final appearance in the series. Terry Scott returned to the series after his minor role in the first film of the series, Carry On Sergeant a decade earlier. The film is, in part, a spoof of Kiplingesque movies and television series about life in the British Raj, both contemporary and from earlier, Hollywood, periods. The title is a play on words in the risqué Carry On tradition, with "Khyber" (short for "Khyber Pass") being rhyming slang for "arse".

  to a direct-drive helium gas turbine which in turn drives a generator for the production of electricity. The nuclear core design is based upon a new conversion technique in which an initial "starter" section of the core provides the neutrons to convert fertile material (used nuclear fuel, thorium or depleted uranium) into burnable fissile fuel. First generation EM2 units use enriched uranium starters (approximately 15 percent U235) to initiate the conversion process. The starter U235 is consumed as the fertile material is converted to fissile fuel. The core life expectancy is approximately 30 years without refueling or reshuffling the fuel.

  lowers costs for electricity and fuel usage. Brownouts and rolling blackouts are more easily prevented. Grids that use cogeneration can enable auxiliary customer equipment when the generators are being run to generate heat rather than electricity. An annoyance for customers is that sometimes the code to turn equipment on is lost, or load shedding is inconvenient or dangerous. For example, during a party, a dangerous heat wave or when life-preserving medical equipment is on-site. To handle these cases, some equipment includes switches to circumvent load shedding. Some meters switch into a higher billing rate when the "party switch" is flipped.

  Conventional controls, including Building and Energy Management Systems and state-of-the-art refrigeration controls, often operate only on reaching pre-programmed static values to switch compressors off and on or adjust capacity. When the measured medium is within the dead band, the system and controllers remain idle. The "energy saving module" is a computer that records the switching values of the primary controller and also measures the 'rate of change' of both the rise and fall of temperatures during the operating cycle. With this data the "energy saving module" computes a reference heat load to match the cooling capacity and then calculates operating parameters. This calculation is used to minimize compressor operation within the switching values, with a resultant reduction in refrigeration and air conditioning compressor run time and reduced electricity consumption. By dynamically measuring the heat load and adjusting the control differential in proportion to the cooling demand it's possible to dynamically control the cycle rate of the compressors. This is achieved while maintaining the desiredoperating temperature.

  A power processing unit (PPU) is a circuit device that convert an electricity input from a utility line into the appropriate voltage and current to be used for the device in question. They serve the same purpose as linear amplifiers, but they are much more efficient, since the use of linear amplifiers results in much power loss due to the use of a resistor to change the voltage and current. Instead of using a resistor, PPUs use switches to turn a signal on and off quite rapidly in order to change the average current and voltage. In this way, they could be conflated with DC-AC converters, but the frequency at which they switch the signal on and off is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of AC signals. They are used to convert the current and voltage of both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) signals.

   In electrical engineering, a protective relay is a relay device designed to trip a circuit breaker when a fault is detected. The first protective relays were electromagnetic devices, relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current, overvoltage, reverse power flow, over-frequency, and under-frequency. Microprocessor-based digital protection relays now emulate the original devices, as well as providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays. Electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indication of the location and origin of a fault. In many cases a single microprocessor relay provides functions that would take two or more electromechanical devices. By combining several functions in one case, numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays. However, due to their very long life span, tens of thousands of these "silent sentinels" are still protecting

Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of leakage reactance.

['A muscle fiber is a long, cylindrical cell that is specialized for contraction. Muscle fibers are multinucleate, meaning that they contain multiple nuclei. They are also highly specialized for the production of contractile proteins, such as actin and myosin.\n\nA group of muscle fibers that are under the control of a single motor axon is called a motor unit. Motor units are essential for the coordination of muscle contractions. They allow for the precise control of muscle movement, as each motor unit can only activate a small number of muscle fibers.\n\nThe number of muscle fibers in a motor unit varies depending on the muscle and the type of muscle fiber. In slow-twitch muscles, such as those found in the soleus muscle, each motor unit may only activate a few muscle fibers. In fast-twitch muscles, such as those found in the quadriceps muscle, each motor unit may activate hundreds of muscle fibers.\n\nThe size of a motor unit is also important for muscle function. In general, larger motor units are associated with faster and more forceful muscle contractions, while smaller motor units are associated with slower and more controlled muscle contractions.\n\nThe coordination of muscle contractions is essential for the proper functioning of the body. Motor units allow for the precise control of muscle movement, which is essential for activities such as walking, running, and jumping.

  Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle, and are more usually known as muscle fibers because of their longer threadlike appearance. A single muscle such as the biceps brachii in a young adult human male contains around 253,000 muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers are the only muscle cells that are multinucleated with the nuclei usually referred to as myonuclei. This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus to the newly formed muscle cell or myotube. Fusion depends on muscle-specific proteins known as fusogens called myomaker and myomerger. A striated muscle fiber contains myofibrils consisting of long

  the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in muscles that contract during locomotor activity. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction,

  A muscle cell is also known as a myocyte when referring to either a cardiac muscle cell (cardiomyocyte), or a smooth muscle cell as these are both small cells. A skeletal muscle cell is long and threadlike with many nuclei and is called a muscle fiber. Muscle cells (including myocytes and muscle fibers) develop from embryonic precursor cells called myoblasts. Myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated skeletal muscle cells known as syncytia in a process known as myogenesis. Skeletal muscle cells, and cardiac muscle cells contain myofibrils and sarcomeres and form a striated muscle tissue. Cardiac muscle cells form the cardiac muscle in the walls of the heart chambers, and have a single central nucleus. Cardiac muscle cells are joined to neighboring cells by intercalated discs, and when joined together in a visible unit they are described as a cardiac muscle fiber. Smooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the esophagus and stomach. Smooth muscle has no myofibrils or sarcomeres and is therefore non-striated. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus.

  the fibers in each of those muscles will fire at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon&mdash;the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body. In multiple fiber summation, if the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are

  around each sarcomere and are filled with Ca2+. Excitation of a myocyte causes depolarization at its synapses, the neuromuscular junctions, which triggers action potential. With a singular neuromuscular junction, each muscle fiber receives input from just one somatic efferent neuron. Action potential in a somatic efferent neuron causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When the acetylcholine is released it diffuses across the synapse and binds to a receptor on the sarcolemma, a term unique to muscle cells that refers to the cell membrane. This initiates an impulse that travels across the sarcolemma. When the action potential reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum

  chains of myofilaments. There are three types of myofilaments: thin, thick, and elastic that work together to produce a muscle contraction. The thin myofilaments are filaments of mostly actin and the thick filaments are of mostly myosin and they slide over each other to shorten the fiber length in a muscle contraction. The third type of myofilament is an elastic filament composed of titin a very large protein. In striations of muscle bands, myosin forms the dark filaments that make up the A band. Thin filaments of actin are the light filaments that make up the I band. The smallest contractile unit in the fiber

 The orderly recruitment of motor units helps the CNS generate a large range of forces and also maintain relatively precise control at the different force levels.The most powerful such motor units are typically recruited only for tasks requiring large amounts of force (e.g., sprinting, jumping, and lifting a heavy weight), tasks that people can perform for only for short periods of time.However, in a proximal limb muscle, such as the quadriceps femoris, a single α motor neuron may innervate thousands of muscle fibers. The muscle fibers that belong to a given motor unit are called a muscle unit. All the muscle fibers in a muscle unit are of the same histochemical type (i.e., they are all either slow-twitch [type I] or fast-twitch [type IIA or IIB] fibers). For an in-depth description of muscle fiber types, see . Of importance in this chapter is that a number of physiological properties are correlated with this histochemical classification scheme. In particular, slow-twitch fibers, which contract and relax slowly as implied by their name, also generate low-force levels but essentially never fatigue. In contrast, the fast-twitch fiber contract and relax rapidly, generate higher levels of force, and fatigue at varying rates. The first motor units to be activated in many cases, either by voluntary effort or during reflex action or just

CHAPTER 9 Organization of Motor Function to maintain posture, are those with the smallest motor axons. These motor units contain slow-twitch fibers and thus generate the smallest contractile force, allowing the initial contraction to be finely graded. These units tend to be active much of the time, if not continuously, and so their lack of fatigability makes good functional sense. As more motor units are recruited for a motor act, motor neurons with progressively larger axons become involved, and these axons synapse onto the fast-twitch fibers. Thus they generate progressively larger amounts of tension. The most powerful such motor units are typically recruited only for tasks requiring large amounts of force (e.g., sprinting, jumping, and lifting a heavy weight), tasks that people can perform for only for short periods of time. The orderly recruitment of motor units helps the CNS generate a large range of forces and also maintain relatively precise control at the different force levels.The size principle depends on the fact that small motor neurons are activated more easily than are large motor neurons.Recall that if an excitatory synapse is active, it opens channels in the postsynaptic membrane and causes an excitatory postsynaptic current.

  When contracting, thin and thick filaments slide with respect to each other by using adenosine triphosphate. This pulls the Z discs closer together in a process called sliding filament mechanism. The contraction of all the sarcomeres results in the contraction of the whole muscle fiber. This contraction of the myocyte is triggered by the action potential over the cell membrane of the myocyte. The action potential uses transverse tubules to get from the surface to the interior of the myocyte, which is continuous within the cell membrane. Sarcoplasmic reticula are membranous bags that transverse tubules touch but remain separate from. These wrap

The sarcoplasm also contains glycogen which provides energy to the cell during heightened exercise, and myoglobin, the red pigment that stores oxygen until needed for muscular activity. The sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, forms a network around each myofibril of the muscle fiber. This network is composed of groupings of two dilated end-sacs called terminal cisternae, and a single T-tubule (transverse tubule), which bores through the cell and emerge on the other side; together these three components form the triads that exist within the network of the sarcoplasmic reticulum,

 The relationship between α motor neurons and muscle fibers within a motor unit is that the α motor neuron innervates and controls multiple muscle fibers. A motor unit consists of an α motor neuron and all the skeletal muscle fibers that its axon supplies. Each α motor neuron's axon branches to innervate multiple muscle fibers within a specific muscle, but each muscle fiber is supplied by only one α motor neuron. This means that when an α motor neuron discharges, all the muscle fibers of the motor unit contract, making the motor unit the basic unit of movement.

The number of muscle fibers innervated by an α motor neuron varies depending on the muscle and the level of fine control required. In muscles that require precise control, such as the eye muscles, an α motor neuron may supply only a few muscle fibers. On the other hand, in larger muscles like the quadriceps femoris in the proximal limb, a single α motor neuron may innervate thousands of muscle fibers.

The α motor neuron's axon terminates by synapsing onto the extrafusal muscle fibers at neuromuscular junctions or end plates. These extrafusal fibers are large muscle fibers responsible for generating the contractile force of the skeletal muscle. It's important to note that a muscle also contains intrafusal fibers, but their functions are beyond the scope of this discussion.

In summary, α motor neurons play a crucial role in controlling muscle contraction by innervating and activating multiple muscle fibers within a motor unit. The organization of motor units allows for coordinated and efficient movement throughout the body.

 3 -6.92347  A muscle cell is also known as a myocyte when referring to either a cardiac muscle cell (cardiomyocyte), or a smooth muscle cell as these are both small cells. A skeletal muscle cell is long and threadlike with many nuclei and is called a muscle fiber. Muscle cells (including myocytes and muscle fibers) develop from embryonic precursor cells called myoblasts. Myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated skeletal muscle cells known as syncytia in a process known as myogenesis. Skeletal muscle cells, and cardiac muscle cells contain myofibrils and sarcomeres and form a striated muscle tissue. Cardiac muscle cells form the cardiac muscle in the walls of the heart chambers, and have a single central nucleus. Cardiac muscle cells are joined to neighboring cells by intercalated discs, and when joined together in a visible unit they are described as a cardiac muscle fiber. Smooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the esophagus and stomach. Smooth muscle has no myofibrils or sarcomeres and is therefore non-striated. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus.
 4 -8.20867  Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle, and are more usually known as muscle fibers because of their longer threadlike appearance. A single muscle such as the biceps brachii in a young adult human male contains around 253,000 muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers are the only muscle cells that are multinucleated with the nuclei usually referred to as myonuclei. This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus to the newly formed muscle cell or myotube. Fusion depends on muscle-specific proteins known as fusogens called myomaker and myomerger. A striated muscle fiber contains myofibrils consisting of long

In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in muscles that contract during locomotor activity. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction,

The relationship between α motor neurons and muscle fibers within a motor unit is that the α motor neuron innervates and controls multiple muscle fibers. A motor unit consists of an α motor neuron and all the skeletal muscle fibers that its axon supplies. Each α motor neuron's axon branches to innervate multiple muscle fibers within a specific muscle, but each muscle fiber is supplied by only one α motor neuron. This means that when an α motor neuron discharges, all the muscle fibers of the motor unit contract, making the motor unit the basic unit of movement. The number of muscle fibers innervated by an α motor neuron varies depending on the muscle and the level of fine control required. In muscles that require precise control, such as the eye muscles, an α motor neuron may supply only a few muscle fibers. On the other hand, in larger muscles like the quadriceps femoris in the proximal limb, a single α motor neuron may innervate thousands of muscle fibers. It's important to note that a muscle also contains intrafusal fibers, but their functions are beyond the scope of this discussion.

  "Part of Me" is a song by American singer Katy Perry, released as the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection. It was written by Perry and Bonnie McKee, with production and additional writing by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. The song was not included on the original edition of Teenage Dream because Perry felt that it did not fit the composition of the album. A demo of the song leaked online in late 2010, amid speculation that the lyrics were directed to the singer's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy. "Part of Me" was re-worked and officially released on February 13, 2012, through Capitol Records with artwork by art director Gavin Taylor and photography by Mary Ellen Matthews. A dance-pop

  form. After listening to the demo, Anastacia agreed to further work on it alongside Watters and co-producer Louis Biancaniello. In an interview discussing the development of the song, Anastacia revealed that they had adopted Massey's approach while writing it, aiming for a song "like "It's Raining Men" and "I Will Survive", one that makes you move and makes you happy." Answering a question on British music show Later... with Jools Holland regarding if this song was about anybody in particular, Anastacia later replied, "It's about a lot of people in particular, not just one but probably many in my life who I wanted to have a love thing with but it wasn't there."

  'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC."

Perry declared it was not about Brand, stating: I wrote it two years ago, which is funny because everybody is like "God, it sounds so current," and some people that I work with were like "You should just say you wrote it a couple of weeks ago." I'm like "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [but] it didn't feel right on the record.

  "My Friends Over You" is credited to all five members of the band: Jordan Pundik (vocals), Chad Gilbert (guitar), Ian Grushka (bass guitar), Steve Klein (rhythm guitar), Cyrus Bolooki (drums). The group had nearly completed recording their third album, Sticks and Stones, before deciding to develop a song that might match the popularity of their previous biggest single, "Hit or Miss". It was the last song written for the album, and evolved from a sole riff to a full song within a day or two. The song lyrically revolves around a relationship where one partner chooses their close friends over romance. "You're with a girl and she wants to take that next step. And though you think the girl's awesome and you're having so much fun with her, because of experiences in the past with other relationships and things that are going on in your life at the current time, you're just not ready to make that step," said Gilbert. Jon Wiederhorn at MTV described the storyline as "angst-ridden teenage memories about awkward relationships and peer pressure."

  "Even Now" is a 1978 song by American adult contemporary and pop music singer Barry Manilow. It is the title track from his 1978 album, and Manilow wrote the music and co-produced the track with Ron Dante. The words were written by Marty Panzer. Released as the second single from the album, "Even Now" became a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1978, peaking at No. 19. It became Manilow's ninth song to reach number one on the Billboard easy listening chart, spending three weeks atop the chart beginning May 27, 1978. Billboard Magazine described "Even Now" as "one of Manilow's classiest efforts." In his autobiography Sweet Life, Manilow said that the song was "one of my personal favorites, which never fails to move me. It reminded me of the great times I had collaborating with" Marty Panzer, with whom the singer had worked previously. The lyrics of this song describe the remorse and regret felt by the lyricist over leaving a woman with whom he had a great relationship with for a much better life with a different woman, even though his instincts told him that it wasn't the right move to make.

  "Save Me" is a song by American rock band Shinedown. The song was released as the first single in promotion of the band's second studio album, Us and Them. "Save Me" was the theme song for WWE's No Mercy 2005 pay-per-view event, and is their second most commercially successful single to date, reaching number one on the U.S. mainstream rock chart (and remaining there for 12 weeks). It is also Shinedown's third-highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 (behind "Second Chance" (number 7) and "If You Only Knew" (number 42), peaking at number 72. The foundations of the song came around when the band's singer, Brent Smith, was just 16 years old and beginning to make demo tracks. At the time the single was released to radio, the band was still working to complete the album which had not yet been mixed or mastered. According to Brent Smith, "when the first single, 'Save Me', hit the radio, I still hadn't written lyrics for four of the songs nor had sung four others on the album. I was in the studio working my ass off to get finished".

This was one of the band's most commercially successful singles, peaking at no. 4 in Canada, no. 6 in the UK Singles Chart and no. 8 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The song subsequently became one of their biggest worldwide hits as well. The 12" release was also available in white vinyl. Two different promotional videos were filmed for the single, a recording studio version shot on 35mm film, minus the band's three string players and a video-taped version made for the Discovery video album, featuring the full touring line-up. A bit of a disco beat on this one, and quite a lot of things going on, forty piece string section and all. It's very jolly and bouncy and I must have been in a very good mood when I wrote it! Billboard praised the song's " catchy melody," "intricate musical techniques, special effects and its "tight, cohesive sound."

['The director of Pay Box Adventure, a film about a group of people who must navigate a dangerous world to find a cure for a deadly virus, was born in the small town of Oakville, Connecticut. Growing up, he was fascinated by movies and spent countless hours watching them and dreaming of one day making his own. After graduating from film school, he worked as an assistant director on several low-budget films before finally getting his big break with Pay Box Adventure. The film, which was shot in a post-apocalyptic setting, was a critical and commercial success, earning the director numerous awards and accolades. Despite his success, however, the director remains humble and grounded, always putting the needs of his cast and crew first.\n"""', 'Where was the director of film Pay Box Adventure born?']

  After graduating, Hedden worked for around seven years for Universal Studios. He wrote and directed his first feature film Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989), which polarized critics, with Leonard Maltin dubbing it "The best film in the Friday series, imaginatively directed and written by Hedden" yet Entertainment Weekly labeling the film the eighth-worst sequel ever made. Hedden is known for such films as You May Not Kiss The Bride, The Condemned, and Clockstoppers, which he co-produced. He also wrote and directed the TV movies The Colony, Alien Fury: Countdown To Invasion (2000), directed and co-wrote Dying To Live (1999) and directed the USA TV Movies Any Place But Home (1997) and Kidnapped In Paradise (1999).

  Warren Sonbert (June 26, 1947 – May 31, 1995) was an American experimental filmmaker whose work of nearly three decades began in New York in the mid-1960s, and continued in San Francisco throughout the second half of his life. Known for the exuberant imagery of films such as Carriage Trade and especially for their intricate and innovative editing, he has been described as "the supreme Romantic diarist of the cinema" as well as "both a probing and playful artist and a keen intellect reveling in the interplay between all the creative arts." "Critics have tried to pin down Sonbert's cinema with catchy formulations," wrote David Sterritt, but "his works are not really diary films, since their carefully shaped contours are determined more by aesthetic insight than daily experience, and to compare them with 'explosions in a postcard factory' is to acknowledge their boisterous variety while missing their ecstatic precision."

 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Production

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role".

  Principe was born in Warwick, Rhode Island and raised in Providence, Rhode Island. He moved from Providence to Los Angeles, California in hopes of playing monsters in films. He has cited Kane Hodder, Nick Castle, Boris Karloff as his inspiration for this desire. Principe discovered that most monsters are played by stunt performers. Already having a black belt in kenpō, and experienced in mixed martial arts fights, he started studying how to become a stuntman. Three months after moving to Los Angeles, Principe was working in a music store and noticed a film production crew across the street. He approached a crew member, and was asked if he was a "PA", or production assistant. Ignorant of the term's meaning, Principe said that he was, and started working on the set. He ended up talking to the stunt coordinator and started doing stunt work in the film industry.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

 2 2.19823 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Cast

Production

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. by Bloody Disgusting. Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million. See also

Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. ", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. by Bloody Disgusting. Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million. See also

The award was presented to him by the International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) in recognition of his outstanding work on the film\'s score. The ceremony took place in Brussels, Belgium, and was attended by some of the biggest names in the film music industry. Arnold\'s score for Timerider, which was his first major film project, was praised for its innovative use of synthesizers and its ability to capture the film\'s adventurous spirit. The award was a significant achievement for Arnold, who went on to become one of the most sought-after film composers in Hollywood, working on films such as Independence Day, Stargate, and Godzilla.\n"""', 'What is the award that the composer of film Timerider: The Adventure Of Lyle Swann won?']

  Paul Sawtell (3 February 1906 – 1 August 1971) was a Polish-born film score composer in the United States. Sawtell began his career with RKO, and eventually joined Universal Pictures. Sawtell worked on many western and horror films, and also scored the Sherlock Holmes films The Pearl of Death and The Scarlet Claw. In the late 1940s, Sawtell returned to RKO. He also worked for various independent producers, including Eagle-Lion Films' production of T-Men (1947). He also composed and arranged the uncredited music for the Venice, Italy sequences in This is Cinerama (1952). In the late 1950s, Sawtell struck up an alliance with fellow film composer Bert Shefter and they produced many film scores together, including those of classic science fiction and horror films such as Kronos, It!

  later, Stoloff brought Gruenburg on to compose to the completed film, as was the usual practice. Stravinsky, never one to let work go to waste, refashioned his unused score into "Four Norwegian Moods," and Gruenberg was nominated for another Oscar. His next film job, An American Romance, was a heart-breaking failure for its director, King Vidor, a $3 million Technicolor tale of a steel industrialist that nobody saw; an uncredited composer was brought in to patch up the half-hour that was lopped out of it after its first screenings, before it lost a million dollars. It ended director King Vidor's long career at MGM.

The Terminator theme is played over the opening credits and during certain scenes at varying tempos, including a piano version during the love scene and a slowed-down version when Reese dies.

  David Arnold, who is best known for composing scores for films, such as Independence Day, Stargate, and Godzilla, completed his journey from the film genres of action-adventure to art house. Amazing Grace is based on the 20-year crusade of William Wilberforce to end slavery in the British Empire, as Arnold includes the scores of quasi-folk songs to Negro spirituals; his basic material, however, remains unchanged from earlier projects. Arnold's tone for this project is far more earnest than before, one that hears distant echos of "Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem" and "Four Sea Interludes" at times, but his score has the merit of being the music that solely functions as an adjunct with an imaging enhancement on the screen, as a medium, not the message.

  Gidget centers on the father-daughter relationship between Frances "Gidget" Lawrence and her widowed father Russell Lawrence. Episodes follow Gidget's adventures in school, at home, and at nearby beaches. Russell Lawrence guides his fifteen-year-old daughter, while married sister Anne and husband John offer often unsolicited child-rearing tips. Gidget's friend Larue sometimes takes part in her escapades. More often than not, Gidget receives moral instruction from her father and gains wisdom from her experiences. Each episode is narrated by Gidget; on occasion, she breaks the "fourth wall" and directly addresses her audience, usually reflecting on what she has learned from the evening's story, sometimes ending with "Toodles!" (an expression Field improvised during production). It was explained in the pilot that her boyfriend called her Gidget because of her demure, petite build and short stature: girl midget, gidget !

In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. Pluk, a young red-haired boy, lives alone in a little room on the top floor of the Petteflet, an apartment building. He has no parents, but he does have a little tow truck. He quickly makes friends, such as Zaza, a cockroach, and Mr. Penn, who operates a bookstore.

She works well with her field friend, wild oats, when there has been any trauma or damage to the brain/central nervous system. She is good to turn to for help in opening your physical self to the bright sunshine of love, life, and spirit. St. J's leaves are dotted with tiny perforations. If you hold one up to the sun, you can see the light shine through it. This is a signature of what she can do—she offers her help to let the light of love shine through your body as she aids you on your healing journey. There are many more physical, chemical, clinical details that could have been added to these briefest of plant biographies, but this was the information I chose to provide my friend with. I came up with this idea of introducing him to each plant in this way because he had never responded well to herbal recipes or simples no matter how appropriate they were; or, rather, he'd respond beautifully for one or two days, and then they would stop helping him. This was the first time that herbs had helped him on a long-term basis. I think this was because they had become spiritual allies rather than mere physical substances. He'd always felt more at home in the realm of spirit. Jim took two droppers of the blend in boiled water or tea, three times daily, for about nine months.

 Tumors of the nose and sinus in dogs are often difficult to diagnose at first. These tumors are located inside the nasal passages, invisible to the naked eye, at least in the earlier stages.
Many times a guardian will notice that their four legged family member starts to sneeze more often. The first thought can be,”Does my dog have a cold?” Sometimes there will be a bit of a cough. Discharge or blood from a nostril are not rare. Finally, there can be changes (a swelling or a indentation) in the outward appearance of the muzzle or around the eye.
Oftentimes, a veterinarian will simply dispense some antibiotics to see if it clears up. The reason for this is that sinusitis (infection of the sinuses) is more common than tumors in the nose.
However, if a dog has a tumor in the nasal passageways, any positive effect of the antibiotics will be short lived. The antibiotics won’t cure the tumor.
The reason why antibiotics may work for a while is that there is a little infection on the surface of the tumor. This is common in nasal tumors. The antibiotics deal with the infection and things get better, but it does not last.
Sometimes guardians will be upset that the tumor was missed initially. This feeling is natural since nasal tumors are serious.
We also need to remember the big picture though. If every dog that arrived at a veterinary hospital with a runny nose was taken for a skull X-ray under anesthesia and sent for a CT scan, most would say this did not make sense.
If 9 out of 10 dogs received the diagnosis of a simple nasal infection after all this testing, most guardians would be unhappy due to overly aggressive testing.
So we have to strike a balance.
How does one actually diagnose a nasal cancer? Typically, in private practice, an X-ray is done as the first step. This allows us to see if there is a proliferation that would not be there normally, within the sinus. Sometimes one can see bone loss in the area of the tumor.
Unfortunately, this is often not enough. A vet may not be able to say definitively that the X-ray changes are due to a cancer in the nose.
A biopsy is often needed. This can be done most of the time with a small scope that has a little grasping arm (bronchoscopy). Sometimes the sinuses can be flushed out to collect some tumor cells that will give us a diagnosis.
These procedures are done under anesthesia.
In considering treatment, to really tell how far along these types of tumors have progressed, a CT (can scan) should be done. X-rays are not very good at telling the extent of tumor spread in the nasal sinuses.
More information about these important cancers can be found in The Dog Cancer Survival Guide.
Hi I was wondering what breeds are prone to nose cancer?
According to Dr. Dressler in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, there are certain breeds at a higher risk for developing nasal tumors including Airedale Terriers, Basset Hounds, Collies, German Shepherds, German Short-Haired Pointers, Keeshounds, and Olde English Sheepdogs.
You can read more about nasal cancer in Chapter 36 of The Dog Cancer Survival Guide, which starts on page 360. We hope this helps.
Hello Mike, Any attempt at giving you a number on which to focus, would not be responsible and would only distract you from enjoying your girl’s joy. 15 is a wonderful age… never enough of course, but it sounds like she is having a grand time. When my very senior dog was becoming very senior, I learned to take my direction from him instead of trying to guide things with my human will. When our dogs get to a good age they surpass us in wisdom. You know your dog better than anyone. If she is enjoying her life so much you see it in her eyes and her behavior. Sure she’s slowing down. Just give her the best nutrition you can, respect her choices, and really be with her. She will tell you, in your heart, if and when she needs help. Give her a wonderful cuddle for me please.
Barbara, There is no danger to your children from Lexis cancer itself, but if you do treat with chemotherapy drugs you may need to isolate her at times, and keep the children away from any of her waste. That’s the “if” you will need to hear from your vet if you do use conventional treatment. Other than that, the joy they have in being together is healing for Lexi as well as your children. Help the children understand her journey and hold her in their hearts rather than being afraid of this strange situation. It will help you all.
Does anyone know if it’s safe for my 3 and 7 year old kids to be around my dog lexi. She has been diagnosed with a cancer tumor in her nose and is sneezing blood. She sleeps in th kids room. I hate to move her because I don’t want her to get upset with a major change. But I am worried about the kids and the cancerous blood when she sneezes.
Is this tumor in a location which means that surgery is not an option? Radiation? https://www.dogcancerblog.com/video/nasal-tumors-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-dogs-cancer/ Sometimes it is, even though it sounds like an extreme action to take. It’s great that Mario is still active and has a great appetite. He doesn’t know or care that the “c” word is part of his life. He just knows how he feels every day and how much you love him. I hope you’re getting him on the Dog Cancer Diet to really optimize that appetite and give him the foods that will help him stay strong. The main points of the diet are available in a free download at the top right of this blog, or at http://www.dogcancerdiet.com. Also in Dr Dressler’s book The Dog Cancer Survival Guide. About your questions, by all means reach out to the people in this blog, but also ask these questions to your vet. They are ideal. “What can I expect” “are there side effects” why does the vet recommend one treatment over another. Take notes. It’s easy to forget some details amongst the emotion of the vet office. While Mario is wagging his tail and enjoying his food, he knows that life is good and sweet. Please make sure you celebrate the days with him and don’t get trapped in the emotions of what may come. Worry is a prayer for what we don’t want. If things don’t go well, Mario will tell you when he’s had enough. In the meantime you have a gorgeous boy who just happens to have a fight to fight, and you can help. All the best to you both, and a special cuddle to Mario.
Our faithful companion, Mario, 11 year old Weish Terrier, was just diagnosed with a sinus tumor. He had a CT scan which confirmed our Vets initial thinking. Mario is experiencing nose bleeds (not severe) & some trouble breathing. We have tried prednisone, antibiotics to try to keep him comfortable. Being a Terrier, Mario is still active, has great appetite & somehow I get the sense that he is hiding how uncomfortable he really is. We are at the point we where need to make some tough decisions. Our options are limited but we are considering Piroxicam to see if that calms things down. We absolutely don’t want Mario to suffer uneccessarily for our selfish reasons but he is a big part of our family & the thought of not doing all we can is not an option. Question that I have for anyone out there is to tell us your experience with this drug & what we can anticipate & what we can do to keep Mario comfortable or are we at the point to where the memories will be our best supportive option? Thank you for any help & to all you folks who are pet lovers like us, may there always be a Mario in your life!
I’m sorry to hear about your boy’s diagnosis. Prednisone is often used as part of a cancer protocol. It’s a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, and it’s also used outside of cancer for many other situations. Does it lengthen a life? There would be no way to have data on that. Does lessening inflammation lengthen life overall? Probably not significantly all by itself. You’re looking at a bigger issue. We have some wonderful blogs on oral and nasal tumors and the possible treatment protocols. Please get your boy on the best nutrition you can (www.dogcancerdiet.com) and work with your vet for the best options for him. Good luck!
Our 2 1/2 year old golden lab mix was diagnoised last november with a nasal tumor. We had done the CT scan, rhinoscopy and surgery……a great cost but with much hope that we would have our pup for a long time. after surgery the Dr. told us that she got everything and we should have him for another 8 years, recently he has been exhibiting the symtoms once again that he had in the beginning. I have been in contact with the Dr that did the surgery and she had advised us to go back to our local vet and they can advise on how to keep him “comfortable” since the cost of the surgery was extravagant and we are unable to provide that again. Any advice on what to ask our local vet when we go next Tueday?
My 6 year old golden retriever was informally diagnosed with a nasal tumor 10 months ago after many months of testing which all showed nothing. At one point, we thought we were going to lose her because she was so sick and had lost so much weight. She was put on several different antibiotics and an appetite stimulant. Everything was good for a while and then she started showing signs of lethargy again, coughing, sneezing, bloody nose and not eating. After more inconclusive testing at a very expensive teaching hospital, I took her back to my regular vet who diagnosed her with the nasal tumor. That was last April and she has been on prednisone ever since and appears to be doing great, although we know her prognosis is not good! This is our 2nd golden with cancer, and having been through it already and seeing what the treatment did to our other dog, we decided to just ride this one out.
We got a diagnosis of a nasal tumor in our beautiful Pepper, a 10-year-old Great Dane, after a biopsy that cleared much of the obstruction in her right nostril……Right now she is exhibiting signs that may say she is in pain…tucking herself in to the corner dog bed (her pal Moose, a 9-year-old Dane uses whatever bed is available)…and when Moose goes upstairs to sleep on the memory foam bed all day…Pepper has been uncharacteristically staying on the corner bed downstairs…ALL DAY. So her energy is not great, but she is as sweet as ever, and very much welcomes a massage and fussing over her…I have just read almost the entire Dog Cancer Survival Guide over the past two days. Before reading the book we had decided to have an x-ray done to get an idea of how extensive the tumor may be, but if i read things correctly, this may be pointless? What I would like to know is whether it makes sense in a Dane of this age to do a CT scan…or whether we should just go forward with the homemade diet, Apocaps….she is taking Tramadol and Rimadyl for hip dysplasia and perhaps arthritis so not sure if that precludes certain treatments or perhaps we could replace Rimadyl with something else (another inflammatory)? I would like to make our sweet girl as comfortable as she can be, while understanding that she has already outlived her life expectancy and that it might be basically cruel to put her through radiation treatment…though I get the impression that if we could get a CyberKnife radiation treatment (we are near to Dr. Ettinger) this might ease her pain somewhat? We have an x-ray scheduled for this week, but it would be wonderful if we get another thought on this..as to whether a CT scan would make more sense…or if we should forego all of these? Perhaps we will try to contact Dr. Ettinger to see if she can give us any advice regarding further diagnostics…and perhaps treatment…But any help would be greatly appreciated.
sorry to hear about your Pepper. I think a consult with Dr. Ettinger would be a good idea, and imaging would be a part of the cyberknife work-up if you plan to go that route, so it would follow logically.
In the end, as a guardian, the decision will be yours, and will be correct as long as you have done your homework.
An alternative to Ck radiation is palliative radiation, which can address pain but does not kill and treat tumor cells the way CK radiation can.
We can go over all the options as they relate to Pepper at an appointment. You can then decide what seems best for you and him.
I look forward to meeting and helping you and Pepper.
My husband’s 4 year old Brussels Griffon, also service dog, was diagnosed with sinus cancer. We were told there is nothing to be done. I can’t figure this out, as I read this cancer usually appears in older, male dogs, with long snouts. Has anyone ever heard of this happening to such a young dog?
My 6 year old puggle has become congested (cloudy mucous) from his nose for the last 8 months. His reverse sneeze has also become much more frequent. After numerous trips to the vet, his sneezing and mucous as only got worse. At first they thought it was nasal mites and he had shots every week for 6 weeks -it seemed to help a bit but didn’t cure it. They did a nasal flush and found nothing. Then a rhinoscopy with biopsy and found nothing so have assumed it is allergies. He is now on Vanectyl – 5 days in – and his sneezing and mucous is the same or worse. Any ideas if it could be anything else? His demeanor and eating habits are the same – should I push for a CT Scan?
Was a cytology done on the fluid to check for cancer cells?
Was a bacterial culture and sensitivity done to check for resistant bacteria?
Was a fungal culture done to check for fungal growth?
Once these items are addressed, the choice will be to absorb the cost for imaging for nasal masses, and/or a nasal biopsy. Sometimes a practice with a very small endoscope can help with nasal biopsies and visualization of some of the nasal cavity.
Sometimes you just need the right medication for allergic rhinitis and a different one might help, along with the proper antibiotic. Don’t forget immune support etc.
I was seeking for more information about Nanodiamond treatment. I know there should be only one vet in Singapore that will recommend you this but what I would really like to know is that was your nanodiamond binded with?
Thank you for your response. It really means a lot to us!
Her current vet is the one who gave us hope when another vet we went to gave us none. But now, even the current vet is giving up on treatment for her because of the metastasis..
We are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. For supplements, she is taking salmon fish oil, astragalus and colostrum with immune factors. We recently ordered K9 immunity and K9 transfer factors online, the shipment delivery should be within these few days. We will also be ordering the Dog Cancer Survival Guide and Apocaps from Amazon as soon as we get our next paycheck. I have read up on artemisinin from your previous blog post. Should we include this as well?
Thank you so much for your advice, Dr. Dressler!
I’d hold off on the Artemisinin until the other steps are in place..
Within a week’s time from my post above, things just went downhill fast..
Last Friday when we brought Precious in for her weekly chemo injection, another vet (hervet was on leave) told us they would discuss about the option of freezing the tumor when her vet is back seeing her tumor growing bigger despite on chemo treatment. We asked if there are other chemo drugs that could be more suitable and the vet replied us that other drugs will do more harm for the dogs than to their cancer. The vet wanted to give her steroid anti inflammation pill but we opted for NSAID and so the vet gave her serrazyme.
On Monday, we noticed her jaw trembled on and off and on Wednesday night, we discovered a new lump at her neck near to her jaw.. Off to vet again the very next day. Her vet just took a look at the new lump and said her cancer is spreading and there’s nothing much they can do for her. They will also stop the current chemo treatment for her, reason being it will do her more harm than good.. Vet also asked us to be mentally prepared for her time to come..
Should I insist for the vet to do a surgery to remove the new lump or biopsy? He did says that if we want surgery to remove it, he could do it but it will come back and he don’t see any point in putting Precious through GA, surgery, recovery, etc. as it will weaken her further..
it is never a bad idea to test to see if indeed we are dealing with a metastasis, in spite of the fact that the odds are higher that it is…but just so we know. I’m wondering…have you read the Dog Cancer Survival Guide? Is Precious on the diet? Apocaps? Immune support? Have you also considered Neoplasene, orally, at low doses, along with mirtazapine? Have you considered other chemo protocols, perhaps seeking a second opinion with an oncologist or at least another vet?
My 7 year old Silky Terrier, Precious, was diagnosed with nasal tumor after a CT scan was performed in December 2012. No biopsy was carried out as her vet advised us that it will be very risky for her due to bone loss showed in the scan.
Since we are living in Singapore, radiation is not an option at all, hence, her vet put her on weekly low dose chemo injection (vincristine) that has been ongoing for 5 weeks now. Prior to this, she was on a new oral drug called nanographite that we are going to discontinue with after her current batch finishes. A very expensive treatment to us, we have to scrimp and save all our money to buy the prescribed dosage. Sadly, it doesn’t do any effect to her tumor which is growing bigger and pushing towards her left eye socket.. Despite her illness, we are thankful that she is still pretty much playful, happy and sniffing everything when we go for our daily walks.
We are feeding Precious a full home cooked diet prepared accordingly to the guide. We add fish oil and (trying to add) coconut oil to her meals. The problem is she is very picky on supplements. If she smells anything different with her food, she refuses eating it even after we prepared another supplement-free portion for her. The only supplement she takes without much fuss is fish oil given at a low amount of 500mg daily.
Well we lost our Ellie yesterday. We did everything we could to keep her happy in her last day. She did have the Nasal tumors but her body ultimately shut down from the over use of Prednisone. She lost her appetite and wouldn’t eat. It is not something I would ever recommend anyone using for any length of time. The all natural things I used really did keep her alive and doing well for over 2 months until her body just was too tired to keep going. She was great Saturday morning out running around and by that evening she couldn’t even get up…so she went fast and did not appear to be in any pain. Good luck to all of you and I wish you all the best with your pets.
Sorry for your loss of Ellie. May memories of the good time ease your pain.
Our 7 year old black lab TJ has been dealing with sneezing with clear mucous since March. Antibiotics didn’t help and was just taking Benadryl. Until one day I came from work to notice he now had green mucous and some blood in his snot. We then had him sedated and had x-rays taken, a culture of his snot was taken and found nothing. X-rays showed nothing and we were refereed to U of M Vet. Clinic. There they suggested a CT and Rhinoscopy which would be $2,500. There thoughts were a foreign object lodged in his nose, fungal infection, or a tumor. We don’t have the money to invest in Chemo and radiation for TJ so we opted to just continue being his normal self until otherwise. The vet did however suggest Proxicam for TJ, I was just wondering if anyone else had used Proxicam alone with out the chemo or radiation treatments and if they think it is worth having our pet take.
I’m sorry to hear that you and TJ are going through this. It’s hard to know what will help without a diagnosis. If there is a nasal tumor, piroxicam may help for a period of time (but as you learned, radiaton is the treatment of choice). Remember this medication is an NSAID which can causing liver and kidney toxicity and stomach ulcers, so I recommend blood work before starting and monthly. If it is fungal, the NSAID is not likely to help. For inflammatory rhinitis, a different anti-inflammatory is typically used (prednisone).
Thank you for your response. I am trying the chinese herb and others things such as tumeric with Bromelain, and flax oil mixed with cottage cheese…etc. We are not able to afford radiation and such for our dog. So I am trying to do all I can. The bleeding finally stopped and she just has that snuffled snoring sound for a few days and now her nose is running mucous again but not as bad. I am sure I am fixing to go another round with the bleeding as I see a bit of color again in the mucous.
@ Joey’s Mom…it is terrible and so stressful going through this, and poor Max is still doing everything he wants to do. I can see signs that are worse some days than others. Especially the discharge from the nose. I dont know alot which is even more frightening too.. However we are taking each day and we will see how it goes as long as he is enjoying life and until that stops and we have to make decisions..
I may try the supplement too, I will try and look into it today..
Love to you and Joey….
My dog Ellie has a nasal tumor. She has had slight bleeding (a little pink in her mucus) I started giving her the Yunnan Bayaio 3 days ago. Last night it was like the tumor broke loose..she is bleeding bad now. What can I do? The vet will do nothing more than give her antibiotics and prednizone which she is already taking.
Sorry about Ellie’s tumor and that you are not getting more help from your vet. There are treatment options for nasal tumors. If your vet is not offering treatment options or a referral, I recommend finding an oncologist. Check at http://www.ACVIM.org, and click on find a specialist. The main treatment is radiation. Check out these blogs.
Also I wrote a chapter on nasal tumors in the Guide, plus there are more non-conventional options for tumors and a lot of good emotional support. Good luck. I am glad you found our blog!
@ Loulou Spencer, I’m glad my comments, for what they were worth, were of some help to you. It’s just so terribly sad we have to deal with this. And if Max is anything like Joey at this time, I’m sure he has no clue the horror that’s growing inside him. All I want to do is cry. I went to Amazon again, thanks to Dr Sue’s suggestion, and purchased some of those Apocaps. Wow! What great reviews this supplement has been given, and some great stories of hope as well. The very best of luck in this nightmare we all find ourselves in. God bless you as well..
@ Dr Sue, thanks so very much for that little tidbit of information. I am having some of those Apocaps sent overnight. Time is of the essence here. The stories people wrote in their reviews of the produce were very encouraging. Thanks so much again.
However your comments have been helpful.
This is a follow up to my comment left last week, with regard to my dog Joey, and the prognosis of his nasal cancer. It is worse than hoped, the cancer he has is aggressive and we’ve decided not to subject him to any more anxiety, and let nature run it’s course. He has problems breathing and the thought of him suffocating makes me panic……..does anyone know if this is a possibility? I will leave you all with one more piece of infomation you can hopefully use. Joey was given a prescription of a medicine (in addition to the Yunnan Baiyao), and that was Piroxocam 10mg capsules, to be given once a day. This is an anti-inflammatory medication that can help with pain but also can slow the growth of some nasal tumors. I was told by my vet he can remain on this, but should have his kidney function checked if he is on it longer than 2 months. Some side effects to look for would be GI upset (vomiting, diarrhea) or ulceration (black tarry stool). If any of these side effects occur stop and contact your vet. I leave this site with the hopes that my experience can help another family deal with this horrible situation a little better. Your in my heart…..
I recommend Yannan and use it regularly for dogs with nasal tumors when there are bleeding episodes.
I also recommend Apocaps (with and without radiation). Also check our the Guide for more suggestions on supplements.
My 7 year old Brussel Griffons “Bug” has been to Auburn University for a CT scan and biopsy of the mass in her left nasal passage. There is bone loss and she has trouble breathing. More so now that she has had the biopsy. Bug has had problems with her left nostil for at least a year, clear mucus and a wheez. I never worrried to much about it and neither did the vet. 9Griffons have the short nose and snort like a Bulldog anyway. 3 weeks ago she started having seizures, first every few nights apart then everynight. She is now taking Predrisone, Phenabarbatol and an antahystamine. She is not the same dog. She is high on the drugs and is still seizing almost every night. The results from the biopsy and cultures wont be back for a week. I’m broken hearted and want her to get better.
My Ellie has been bleeding from her nose more this week. The vet decided she most likely has a tumor since her nasal passage/throat/larynx all look good. Lungs are clear. He scoped her nose and could not find anything. When breathing she sounds as if she is snoring. Lots of mucus. Now her nose is bleeding again. Has anyone tried to use any herbs? Ginger? Curcumin? Has anyone had any success with anything like that?
I want to thank all of you ( with the exception of Shenaz) for your helpful and informational posts. My black lab, Jake, has had severe sneezing for the past couple weeks. I noticed a few noosebleeds as well as discharge. I am taking him to the vet tomorrow and pray that it is nothing more than sinunitis or allergies. However, if the news is bad I will do whtever it takes to ensure he is comfortable. I will keep you all posted of the outcome. Thanks again.
this is very sad for me that my 15 year old mixed female dog has a nose tumor. we thought for sure it was allergies but it is not. she is having many nose bleeds and getting a little swollen on her nose. she eats well and still is the same old cheyenne we had for years. my life would not be perfect if it wasn’t for my cheyenne. she has been wonderful and my family. i would do anything for her. at this stage there is nothing we can do for her , only make her comfortable and love her. iam sorry shenaz that you can NOT understand how the love of one animal brings so much joy to you. i hope you can find that love one day with a pet of your own.
And thank you for helping all of us, who are trying to deal with thine enemy, “CANCER”, in whatever form it takes, for our furry loved ones. Be they canine or feline, they are members of our families.
If you feel that way about dogs, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why you would bother to post on this site. I would bet that anyone who posts on this site to Dr. D., are aware of the “starving child” situation. The difference between you (including people like you) and us is that we were born with the “compassionate” gene. You have insulted me, and anyone else who is legitimately, seeking help and advice for a situation that involves both people and animals. That is cancer. And it know no bounds. People who have cancer or people who love someone or something that has cancer, are in enough grief and pain, that you really have no business posting anything here. A good part of the process of dealing with cancer is to have a positive attitude. And the hope to find a solution to help someone or something to battle this horrible disease. I personally would like to know what charities or how many children you’ve help to feed, or have had them sit at your table and shared your dinner with. I’ve done it. And I came to this site, hoping to get answers about fighting the disease that, Sam, my little Jack Russell/Schauzer mix has, and who I adopted from an abusive and neglected situation back in 2001. He is more loyal and non-complaining than most people that I know. My heart goes out to anyone, who reads your comment, because it is really not meant to be here, since it is a real ‘slap-in-the-face’ to anyone who’s facing their dilemna with a loved, four- legged, furry companion, who is a member of their family.
Dr. D. (or whoever monitors your site, I do NOT have a problem with you deleting my post or the post above.) I’m appreciating any info/advice I can get to help my little guy, Sam. He deserves it.
many care, although you don’t care about non-human animals…many of us do. It is a shame you have not had the opportunity to enjoy a connection or a relationship with non-human animals.
Oh these stories sound so familar to what iam going through with my collie Lassie.She has been a sneezer most of ther adult life.As soon as i seen the green bloodish discharge we went straight to the vet.They started with taken xrays that showed a grayish area around the teeth area an where the spot was on her face under her eye an antibotics for 10days.That didnt work so we tried a strong one for 5 days no better after that.So i took her back an they took a sample from her an sent it off.The results came back 3 days later that it was nasal cancer.I was broken hearted to find this out but i know that i was very aggressive with the vet to get to the bottom of this.She is now on piroxicam until the end.My big question now is how long do i have with her?
I am sorry this is happening to your Lassie. I wish I could give you a number for how long you have with her. None of us, including vets, are able to tell when someone will pass.
So you are not alone in this question.
Hang in there. Hopefully you are using the exercises in the Guide?
All of the above is very consistent with Hunny’s nasal tumor. She had radiation to help shrink the tumor, and is currently taking Chinese herbs and piroxicam. Both really seem to be helping. I knows that there is no cure. About how long do most dogs have with a nasal tumor?
Since I am going through exactly what the doctor describes in this nasal tumor blog I want to contribute some of my thoughts.
Then in February, another bleed happens. But ends quickly so we carry on. Then another in March so I bring her to her vet. We get sent home with a course of antibiotics for sinusitis, just as the doctor states in his article.
Things clear up and so all is well – or is it?
Short story, more green mucous shows up in April and more antibiotics are called for. But the mucous goes and returns so I take Jett to some vets I know who are able to get x-rays of Jett’s head without requiring Jett to be put under.
These pictures show opacity in the left nostril and we send these pictures off to a radiologist for analysis. The report comes back saying a CT scan is needed to definitively diagnose the nostril.
So, on May 20th, we get a CT and I learn Jett has a nasal tumor and a mass on the right atrium.
Well, this rocks my whole world.
What I haven’t shared is that in the month of April, Jett survived emergency abdominal surgery for bloat (stomach twists- torsion). She also has subsequent visits to vets for the nasal discharge when I thought she got an infection while in hospital. The surgeon also told me of an opacity in her lungs, which they could not diagnose but her abdomen and her organs were free of any observable cancer. That news is good but I know I need to learn what the lung issue is.
So, in a very short span of time Jett as been through the ringer and my pocketbook was now short nearly five figures. So getting news about the cancer and learning treatment is costly – and Jett’s age – I was hurting because I want to help her live as long as she wants to.
I found The Dog Cancer Survival Guide and began reading. The doctor’s book really helped me get organized and get control of a lot of unknowns and my emotions. But he also informed me of alternatives to the Big Three that gave me some hope I could help Jett.
To close I must say a few things, first, I think my vet whiffed, that is swung and missed by prescribing antibiotics instead of saying, Mike- she’s eleven years old, a large breed and the chances for cancer being in that nose are high. And sadly Mike, we are seeing a high incidence of cancer in our pets these days. Let’s get some pictures.
Secondly, for most of us, our choices of vets are limited for whatever the reason. And so we need to become the boss of our pet’s care. And we need to carefully consider the toxins we, ourselves introduce into our pets’ lives. Their food, their vaccinations, and the pesticides we put on their bodies. And if we can, we need vets who are educating themselves in the broad view when comes to treating cancer in our pets. Because there is power in the plants around us. The bottom line is-most vets today will not countenance nutraceuticals in their plan to fight pet cancers. This is slowly changing and Dr. Dressler is an example of the change for our pet’s betterment.
Lastly, if you have a pet who is a senior, pure breed, but otherwise in what seems good health – review everything and don’t be passive. My vet should have added up all that was working against Jett in this moment. In Jett’s case, I think it was time to take a chance and call for more aggressive analysis.
Look at the reality of our world and get familiar with cancer. What it is. How it comes about. How it lives and how it can be made to die. You’ll also be helping yourself prepare for cancer on the human side too.
Vets should become cancer proactive and talk frankly about cancer, we’re adults, we can take it. There is guidance on prevention that must be applied in the present. Our medical professionals have to get busy and have more to offer us than just slashing, burning and poisoning.

In a small 2003 study by Drs. Vedat Sar, and Turgut Kundakci (MD), two hundred and forty (240) consecutive patients who presented to a university outpatient psychiatry unit were screened. Twenty-five (25; 10.4%) of the participants tested positive for BPD and 33 participants (13.8%) tested positive for dissociative disorder in the final evaluation. Sixteen participants or 64.0% with BPD also tested positive for a dissociative disorder (i.e., dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, depersonalization disorder). The findings demonstrate that a significant part of psychiatric outpatients who fit the criteria of BPD have a DSM-IV dissociative disorder on Axis I. The presence of dissociative symptoms as a part of BPD could lead to overlooking the possibility of a co-occurring dissociative disorder.
Here's my take... .Horrible childhood abuse tends to create mental illness, especially with family histories of drug/alcohol addiction or mental illness. Sometimes kids make it through basically sane. But most do not, and most when they are enduring the abuse, must dissociate to survive it. I think there are a lot of variables involved, and this early dissociation can continue to be used as a coping mechanism and potentially morph into DID (dissociative identity disorder) or BPD. Or other mental illnesses.
My dBPDso has the Jekyll and Hyde thing - most of the time she's sweet and child-like, thoughtful and generous and accepting and loving. And then when she dissociates so badly that she has a full psychotic break, her face literally gets darker, her eyes deeper and scary, and her voice changes, the way she speaks is different. The nice, self-effacing person is replaced by an abusive b_tch. I know it's her, it's not a different personality--it's part of her personality that only wakes up when the working part of her brain is triggered in particular ways and stops working right.
My partner remembers everything that happens during these times. She says it's like a dream where she's watching herself from above, unable to control herself, unable to really feel that it's her doing the things she's doing.
Sometimes she fears that it is DID, most of the time she says she knows it's not. (She knows what's going on. She has all 9 diagnostic criteria of BPD, plus PTSD, PMDD, and panic attacks. But not the symptoms of DID.
Like DID, though, BPD is often developed during childhood abuse as protection. The horrors are too great for the little mind to cope with, and cause it to split, to separate the awful things into compartments in a way that allows a part of the mind to remain sane--as opposed to someone who becomes full-time psychotic. So in that way, the diseases have similarities--DID creates different personalities to handle various and/or triggering things, while BPD creates different behaviors to handle triggering situations and emotions. Point is, there's a vulnerable person that's protected by a tougher personality (DID) or an a$$hole persona (BPD).
I don't know a ton about DID, and I base my opinions on BPD on my readings and my experiences with my partner. BPD has lots of other criteria, the DID-like aspects are only a part of this disorder, and I imagine that DID has lots of stuff BPD doesn't have, like there are a bunch of different personalities that handle different situations and they all have different names--note the name of the disease was changed from "personality" to "identity" implying that those with DID do have these separate identities with different conciousnesses and experiences.
And again, this is my theory for those who got these diseases as a partial result of childhood abuse. I know that they can develop without the abuse, but I don't know how that works.
My husband's ex-wife would dissociate to violence or near-violence but swear later that she did not do it, say it, or remember it. This included telling him that if he ever left her, she would burn down the house with the children in it.
I truely beleive there is a connection between the BPD and MPD. Prior to leaving a 20 year relationship with a BPD, the last year and a half I keep a journal of all her chaotic and bizarre moments, which I recorded her behaviours, anger outbursts, rages, ect... .I journaled and audio recorded these occurances for court proceedings, per my lawyer, because children were involved. In a nine month period, I recorded 56 pages of arguements and 40 hours of audio. Referring to Hurricanes, these arguements were Category 4 and 5 range. My BPD wife, after a cool down period and when asked, did not remember one single incident. When asked in court about these arguements, she stated se could not remember, when certain arguements and the issues of those arguements were brought up, she stated they did not happen.
The strange and awe inspiring part of the arguements I still have trouble with, is she looked directly over the top of my head while raging frantically, her face white as a ghost, not bulging red like one would think and her eyes were glassed over.
I do believe there is similarity between DID and any of the other dissociative disorders, including BPD and even severe depression. The difference is that in someone with full blown DID, the dissociation is much more severe and dramatic. Whereas someone with BPD has the classic "Jekyll and Hyde" dynamic, someone with DID is literally harboring different people within themselves. Each of the dissociated parts has a different name, different abilities (including being able to speak languages the other alters cannot), and different relationships with the outside world of which the other "alters" are usually totally ignorant. Someone with DID might be named Jane on her birth certificate, but at work she is known as Mary because that is the alter who got the job. She might lose the job because Denise, a three year old alter, comes on the scene one day and bursts into tears in the middle of an important meeting. Typically, in someone with DID there is one core alter who has all the dirt about all the others. Getting this alter to participate fully in therapy is usually required to achieve any sort of effective treatment.
Though there is some debate as to whether or not DID had its glory day as the "mental illness du jour" in the mid eighties and is nowhere near as prevalent as once was thought. Recent revelations that the two most famous media portrayals of DID, "Sybil" and "The Minds of Billy Milligan," were both fabricated didn't help on the credibility front either.
BTW, it is commonly believed that people who end up having DID suffer the worst kind of ritualistic abuse, such as Satanic cults, etc. It takes a LOT of very intense, very evil and prolonged abuse to produce DID, from what I understand.
I did a research paper for first yr college english course on MPD in mid 90's. It was very difficult to find info on the subject. Cult, the info you just provided on MPD is how I understood the mental illness. The one thing that has always stuck in my mind about the dissociation and going into other personalities are the headaches they get as they are about to go into another personality. Therapist in fact go by the headache before change in personality as an indication that they may be MPD. My exBPD had headaches (migraines) frequently.
I'm definitely with you Bitdawg!
I am a new member but have been involved with someone who has BPD and DID.
My experience and understanding is that the two conditions are often comorbid or co-exist.
My BPD person experienced terrible childhood abuse and still dissociates to this day when under any kind of stress. I think it makes the experience for the non even harder because not only do you get the classic BPD push pull, etc but also the fragmentation of DID.
I am taught that it is a matter of degree. A multiple personality doesn't usually remember one from the other as they transition.
My stbxbph has been dx with both BPD and DID, the explanations I have read here on this thread are pretty accurate. I have avoided talking about his DID problems on this site so that it wouldn't get confusing and I am actually glad that someone brought it up.
On a personal level dealing with someone with both is so difficult that I actually envy some of the stories I have read on this site. My stbxbph is currently in a personality that can't remember any of the bad things that he has done and can not understand why I won't work it out with him and thinks that I have not allowed him to see his daughter over the last 4 years (even though I took her to see him on 3 separate occasions), when in reality he hasn't made any effort to see her and when he has made an arrangement to come see her he always changed his mind (personality), he also doesn't understand why she (D) doesn't want anything to do with him.
It seems to be an age thing for him, each personality has an age that is anywhere from 3 to 50, and different people and circumstances bring out different personalities, so his friends know one person and his work another and his family knows the rest, either of the two people he is when he is at work or with his friends, I could live with, but at home aarrrggghhhhh!
I can tell which personality he is in by how he talks, what vocabulary he uses, his writing changes, his memories change and more so than just changing something to be better than it actually was, he doesn't even remember that something happened, I have had to break up with him numerous times. It has taken me 4 years to get to the legally separated stage, because every time I get him to realize that we are not getting back together, he switches personality and starts talking to me as though everything is fine.
He has to keep everything very simple, He has to write everything down to keep track of what he is supposed to be doing and when he does forget to do something or loses something it is always my fault (more so than just with the BPD), and he really is convinced that it was me, because he can not remember having anything to do with it.
Wow, this is just too much right now, to talk about, as I wasn't prepared to discuss the DID, if you all are interested in knowing more, I will be happy to share... .but not tonight.
My friend is diagnosed as DID and BPD as well. I agree with notmyproblem's comments about the age thing. My friend has about 5 personalities, each at a different age - supoosedly they are ages when traumas happened, major or minor, and the person couldn't cope so split off into another personality. The worst part is the person I knew so well is the one that never comes out anymore and she's forgotten about. That persona was the one I fell in love with and then spiralled out of control as what I now know as BPD. She described it as there being too much pain and darkness so she put her to sleep for a very long time. She says that persona is locked away some where way down deep inside her and may never come back because it hurts too much. my friend has changed her name and doesn't remember things that happened before, right down to interests and core values. The original used to be a passionate reader, confident and a great leader - she was training to be a teacher and would have been darn good at it. When everything happened she gave up on that goal, I once made a comment saying it's a shame she would have been good at it and she replied with no x would have been good at it, she's alseep now, y has no interest in anything like that. the other personalities are also used to split things off from herself that she doesn't like. She has one character who is sick with bullimia and anorexia, one that represents her sexuality who she doesn't like, one that represents her anger etc. It makes it hard because when she behaves in BPD ways she either doesn't remember them because it was a different persona or separtes herself from responsibility, saying it's not my fault i needed to cut you made character y come out. Or you made character z feel threatened and about to be abandoned so she lashed out at you with intense anger to protect the main persona. How i didn't end up in a mental hospital myself from dealing with it I don't know. Having both is incredibly difficult.
Dissociative identity disorder (DID), also known as multiple personality disorder, is "a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a condition in which a single person displays multiple distinct identities or personalities (known as alter egos or alters), each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment." According to wikipedia's page on BPD, it is suggested that if a patient meets all 9 diagnostic criteria for BPD, they be tested for DID.
This is pure speculation on my part, but it seems like BPD and DID may be related through the same mechanisms of brain function. I think DID is a more severe form of BPD. Here is how I'm thinking of it: those with BPD have a split "emotional memory" of other people who are close to them. They are unable to integrate the positive and negative emotions about a loved one, so they are either "all good" or "all bad" depending on whatever they are triggered towards at the time. They may dissociate often, and they also unconsciously mirror their new partner in the early stages of a relationship taking on what seems to be a whole new personality.
I believe that DID simply takes this process a step further, and those with DID are unable to integrate ANY aspects of their memory and their different personalities. Their multiple personalities have completely different attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions. And they often have associated memory loss such that they can't remember things when the other personality takes control.
My experience with those who seem to have BPD is that they can take on vastly different personalities, depending on who they are around and what mood they are in. And SOMETIMES they don't even remember the details of what happened when they were triggered -- they are either denying it, distorting events, or are outright delusional about what happened. In general, they do have a memory of events but the one thing they seem to lack is the emotional memory of people or events. I know from my experience I feel like those with BPD can become "completely different people" when they are stressed out and triggered. It's like you don't even know what happened to the person you knew. It seems like nearly everyone else on these boards feels the same way at some time in their relationship with someone with BPD.
So what do you guys think: is it possible DID is a more severe form of BPD? Such that the patient with DID doesn't have the ability to integrate any, or nearly any, aspect of their personality or memory, while the person with BPD cannot integrate their positive/negative perceptions of themself and others and can't integrate their emotional memory? Basically, BPDs can't integrate emotional perception, while DIDs can't integrate any perception (hence the complete split in personalities) of themself/others.
Actually, my T would agree with this assesment as she has told me that that BPD and DID are on what T's call a 'continum' of the psycholgoical state of mind and that DID is much further down the line from the personality disorders like BPD or NPD.
I have been a member for quite some time, but haven't been here or posted in a long time. OK... so I have/had several people with BPD in my life... .my late partner, was the only one who actually really made progress(with treating BPD, he was willing, as tough as it was for him, and made progress), we had individual AND couples therapy... .but I'm digressing. This board helped me out so much in the past, so I want to at least add in what I know.
I have DID... and yes, there are some commonalities... like dissociation continuum... and the depression, anxiety, self destructive at times... etc. goes along with DID(and BPD, but varies person to person in severity) ... but not in the same way... .the personality splits, but for different reasons... DID develops in early childhood years from chronic, sustained abuse too traumatic to deal with, parts are made to hold the memory away from consciousness... .a coping skill to continue carrying on at the time, keeping one more sane than not. It becomes dysfunctional in adulthood, when the danger is no longer persent, and for many other reasons... .
There are differences in both BPD and DID depending on the individual... but I can say illicting pity or admiration is not a part of who I am... I do have a stronger sense of self... and there are varying levels of perception. DID people can be super high functional for a long time, and spend an average of 7 years in the mental health system until the read diagnosis is found. It often might at first look like BPD, or bi-poloar... .but honestly, the bare bones of it... .they are really different things... .totally. I have been healing and in treatment for myself a long time... I do have co-consciousness unless it's a certian kind of situation, or a certain altar out... .but this is worked on in therapy... .any one of my neighbors would be shocked to find out I had DID if I were to tell... I can say that! LOL. The system I have has been made to "blend in", and mostly we want to hide, not be the focus of attention.
Basically... there can be personalities that might have a leaning towards several BPD components(separate personalities can have their own separate mental health issues, along with other things), but at least none of mine fit that bill truly and totally... .and actually... .the ones I'm aware of are not BPD. There's the whole manipulations, and... .OK... .maybe it's easier to concentrate first what seems similar, this is a topic close to my heart... .b/c if I had been treated all along as BPD... I would not be well or as well as I am right now... .so... there's dissociation... .DID is more extreme in that... but the reasons for are usually different. Seeming like a different person, I can only speak personally, and with the BPD's in my life, it's really exposing what their fears and distortions look like, up close and personal. These things are always lurking in there but often controlled or hidden, like a "slip" into true feelings... instead of triggering into an altar personality that was formed a long time ago, and has their own distinct history, ones I don't know all of, often... but we've learned how to work together,... and that is our integration... .OK... this is a lot at once, sorry. The other things... .depression, well, that is not uncommon for severly abused peoples and in BPD's... but even though I'm having more than one "personality state"... .I have a stronger "sense of self"... than most BPD's I've met. Anxiety... .usually with me related to PTSD... .Often there are diagnosis's that have many things in common... .but are fundamentally different. I think the strongest common denominator would be dissociation... and that varys person to person in either dx as well. I can have altars that fear being abandoned, usually child altars, but for totally different reasons... and abandonment as a fear is not near number one... at least not for me... one of my abusers is BPD... .so I have parts that learned how to relate with her... .but we/I still dont "get it"... or am continually surprised and hurt by certain BPD behaviors to this day... even though I intellectually know it's there, and try to brace myself for it, it's always shocking to me the lines of thought and black and white thinking, to name a few... .Then with working through therapy with me and my late partner(we were together a decade) who was BPD... even though I have a splintered self(though much more managable these days)... there were separate and distinct bottom lines for both of us. The therapist that did the couples counseling, was pointing out always things about BPD for him and DID for me... .and how we played into each other to unhealthy extremes... .like he loved to BLAME... .nothing was ever truly his fault, taking responsibility... .etc... .and I loved to TAKE BLAME... even blame that was not mine to take, so our fundamental problems and how we related to people and each other were very different. Most of me takes on too much blame, so differnt parts, but same person... .with me... .even though we are several... .the same underlying personality... that is a damaged person that takes on too much, instead of the other way around... .making us a perfect target for BPD's... .or at least it used to... .we can spot things and about face now better than ever before. I loved my partner, and we "made it"... but I don't think I'd ever willingly get into that situation again... the amount of work... etc... .I have enough with just me(s)... .LOL... .
Thanks for the personal explanation, karmickiss!
Thanks, JoannaK! This is interesting. Oh the tangled web! I am endlessly fascinated with dissociation, as in how it's experienced in BPD... .even after all this time, reading, counseling... .with people with BPD and with myself with DID... .Very interesting how it's the same... .dissociation... but there are also differences in it(at least if I'm reading right, and if I understood the people that had Dx'd BPD and were willing to share about their dissociation symptoms)... in ways I'm still putting my finger on. It's been a while... .I am still friendly with the young man who was my biggest problem area last time I was here.
It's been tough, just b/c my late partner really made strides... and we had some "gift time" together, where things were finally more peaceful, loving and honest than I'd ever have imagined. But, that was the exception... .there's my mom... and then like I said, this young man, who has been my friend(and we had a fling, long time ago) but I had to put some boundaries into place. The thing is, the male figure in my kids lives. They really miss their step dad still... of course... .and this friend of mine... they just didn't want to lose all contact... .and I didn't want to "take away" another person they are familiar with... .So... .also out of love, we stay at a certain connectedness. The neat thing about my friend, vs. my mom, is that he is aware of his BPD to a surprising degree. He is unable at this time to go to counseling with it... he has the official diagnosis... .but... .
Has anyone encountered splitting so severe that they suspected DID? Is there a thread or info along these lines?
