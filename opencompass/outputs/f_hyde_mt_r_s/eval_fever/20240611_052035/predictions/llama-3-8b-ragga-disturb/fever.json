Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.\n\n"

Axons from the posterior hypothalamus descend through the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formations. The anterior hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. Damage or destruction of this nucleus causes hyperthermia. The anterior hypothalamic region is sometimes grouped with the preoptic area. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch). The axons of these second order neurons then decussate, joining the spinothalamic tract as they ascend to neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Neurons from the pre-optic and hypothalamic regions of the brain that respond to small changes in temperature have also been described, providing information on core temperature. The hypothalamus is involved in thermoregulation, the thermoreceptors allowing feed-forward responses to a predicted change in core body temperature in response to changing environmental conditions. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is involved in feeding, drinking, body-weight regulation and circadian activity. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus receives information from neurons and humors involved in feeding regulation, body weight and energy consumption, and then passes this information on to brain regions involved in sleep and wakefulness regulation, body temperature and corticosteroid secretion.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Axons from the posterior hypothalamus descend through the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formations. The anterior hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. Damage or destruction of this nucleus causes hyperthermia. The anterior hypothalamic region is sometimes grouped with the preoptic area. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch). The axons of these second order neurons then decussate, joining the spinothalamic tract as they ascend to neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Neurons from the pre-optic and hypothalamic regions of the brain that respond to small changes in temperature have also been described, providing information on core temperature. The hypothalamus is involved in thermoregulation, the thermoreceptors allowing feed-forward responses to a predicted change in core body temperature in response to changing environmental conditions. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is involved in feeding, drinking, body-weight regulation and circadian activity. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus receives information from neurons and humors involved in feeding regulation, body weight and energy consumption, and then passes this information on to brain regions involved in sleep and wakefulness regulation, body temperature and corticosteroid secretion.\n\n"

After processing, all of the raccoon pelts are perfect, and Jameson calls Feldman to arrange a sale. In 1820, Otis \"Cookie\" Figowitz is a quiet chef traveling in Oregon Country with a group of loud and aggressive fur trappers who harass Cookie for not bringing them enough food while foraging. Cookie allows Lu to hide in his tent for the night and watches him escape across the river the next day. Cookie and Lu later reunite and spend several days \n\n Nicol, a 14-year-old genius inventor and his girlfriend Stella, manage to invent a dimensional space transporting device. The Demon offers to buy the device from the couple and act out his nefarious plans. They sneak onto the Chief Factor's property at night, Cookie milking the cow and Lu keeping watch from a tree. They manage to get enough milk to bake a batch of biscuits without being caught. While Cookie is unsatisfied with the result, wishing it could be sweeter, Lu points out that it tastes better than any food the outpost has and that it could easily sell for a lot of money. When asked how they're made, Lu claims it's a \"Chinese secret.\"\n\n"

It is still unknown if the entire album, including \"Even You Brutus\" was performed and if so, why it has never been released. At the time of filming, guitarist Josh Klinghoffer was suffering from a broken foot so he was seated during the performance. Walter Giardino says about this: \"«I think it's metallic rock. Guitarist John Frusciante quit the band shortly thereafter in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall who was fired in 1993 being briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias before Dave Navarro was hired that same year.\n\n"

The film touches on an up-and-coming season at the fictional higher learning institution of Texas State University and its football team nicknamed the Fightin' Armadillos. (At the time the film was made, there was no Texas State University, but in 2003, Southwest Texas State University changed its name to Texas State University, nicknamed the Bobcats, which coincidentally was the \"season opener\" opponent of the fictional Texas State Armadillos.) The once-powerful Armadillos are forced to start the season with a host of new coaches and players after the previous staff and all but one players are banned following a scandal. This predicament is based on the \"death penalty\" handed out to the Southern Methodist University football team for violations very similar to the ones found at the fictional Texas State. Chaney and a suitably impressed Speed travel to New Orleans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds, recruiting genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin) to tend to his wounds. Chaney easily disposes of his next opponent, a Cajun hitter. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback. As Owens struggles to support his girlfriend Ruth and young daughter, he takes a job at a service station, upsetting Snyder when his job conflicts with his commitment to train. When Snyder learns Owens has a family to support, he gets him a no-show job, allowing him to focus on running. Owens goes on to break several records, including some of Snyder's, and begins a relationship with a woman whose attentions he attracts with his newfound fame.

        "context": "The film stars Scott Bakula, Héctor Elizondo, Robert Loggia, and Harley Jane Kozak. The film touches on an up-and-coming season at the fictional higher learning institution of Texas State University and its football team nicknamed the Fightin' Armadillos. (At the time the film was made, there was no Texas State University, but in 2003, Southwest Texas State University changed its name to Texas State University, nicknamed the Bobcats, which coincidentally was the \"season opener\" opponent of the fictional Texas State Armadillos.) The once-powerful Armadillos are forced to start the season with a host of new coaches and players after the previous staff and all but one players are banned following a scandal. This predicament is based on the \"death penalty\" handed out to the Southern Methodist University football team for violations very similar to the ones found at the fictional Texas State. Chaney and a suitably impressed Speed travel to New Orleans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds, recruiting genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin) to tend to his wounds. Chaney easily disposes of his next opponent, a Cajun hitter. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback. As Owens struggles to support his girlfriend Ruth and young daughter, he takes a job at a service station, upsetting Snyder when his job conflicts with his commitment to train. When Snyder learns Owens has a family to support, he gets him a no-show job, allowing him to focus on running. Owens goes on to break several records, including some of Snyder's, and begins a relationship with a woman whose attentions he attracts with his newfound fame. When Ruth threatens him with a lawsuit, Owens becomes distracted and loses a race to runner Eulace Peacock.\n\n"

The university moved out to a larger campus in the Haidian District when Mao established the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the Honglou is now a museum. Shortly after the university moved, Mao established the Central Academy of Drama, the only institution of higher education currently in the district. It is located on Dongmianhua Hutong, a short distance west of Nanluoguxiang. East China Normal University traces its roots to the formation of the St. John's College (later to become St. John's University) in 1879, and its heritage has had a deep influence in the development of Chinese modern higher education.

The university moved out to a larger campus in the Haidian District when Mao established the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the Honglou is now a museum. Shortly after the university moved, Mao established the Central Academy of Drama, the only institution of higher education currently in the district. It is located on Dongmianhua Hutong, a short distance west of Nanluoguxiang.

The Germans, commanded by Field Marshal von Moltke, began to assemble into three armies, which were to invade France and to occupy Paris. When Napoleon III arrived to take command of the French field army, he followed the urging of his generals and ordered General Lebœuf to besiege Saarbrücken. Following a vigorous defense the outnumbered Germans evacuated the city, which the French occupied without crossing the river Saar. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain.

The Germans, commanded by Field Marshal von Moltke, began to assemble into three armies, which were to invade France and to occupy Paris. When Napoleon III arrived to take command of the French field army, he followed the urging of his generals and ordered General Lebœuf to besiege Saarbrücken. Following a vigorous defense the outnumbered Germans evacuated the city, which the French occupied without crossing the river Saar. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain.
