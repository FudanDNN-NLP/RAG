The company Mercury Records launches the first stereo record on the market. The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 is a boxed set compilation comprising the Beatles' 1964 American Capitol Records releases. The set, which features the first official stereo versions of a number of tracks on CD, was released in late 2004. The CDs were mastered from submaster tapes from the Capitol Records vaults which were prepared by Capitol A&R executive Dave Dexter Jr., who added reverb to several tracks and simulated stereo (\"fake stereo\") on mono tracks. For instance, fans of folk rock, psychedelia and other genres have become ever more interested in original short-run vinyl private pressings. The first wave of classical collectors concentrated on early stereo orchestral recordings on labels such as the British Decca and EMI, and the American Mercury Records Living Presence series and RCA Victor Living Stereo series. Some of these records still sell at auction for hundreds of dollars.

However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning. Nola is the capital of Sangha-Mbaéré, an economic prefecture of the Central African Republic.\n\nQuestion: Of which African country is Niamey the capital?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Life is a musical with a book by David Newman, Ira Gasman and Cy Coleman, music by Coleman, and lyrics by Gasman. Based on an original idea by Gasman, the show explores the underbelly of Times Square's 42nd Street, inhabited by pimps and prostitutes, druggies and dealers, and runaways and street people in the era prior to its Disneyfication. The convoluted plot revolves around the misadventures of the title character (whose first name sports the extra \"a\" dropped by Barbra Streisand from her own) and her journey from a Brooklyn fish market to fame as a Hollywood gossip columnist, and then a career culminating in an Academy Award nomination and a nervous breakdown. The score is a mix of disco and typical Broadway show tunes. It featured additional songs by Warren and lyrics by Dublin and Johnny Mercer and a book by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble.

Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that only a small number of civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful. JWPC submitted a plan based on the use of nuclear weapons. On the assumption that between 100 and 200 nuclear weapons would be available, it called for 34 atomic bombs to be dropped on 24 Soviet cities; seven would be dropped on Moscow, three on Leningrad and two each on Kharkov and Stalingrad. It was reckoned that this would do massive damage to the Soviet Union's industries, and would kill or injure about one million of its citizens. The damage might well cause the Soviet Union to sue for peace. The assumption that a hundred atomic bombs were available was not correct.

Painter Alex Ross, writer Kurt Busiek and Alan Moore himself tried to \"reconstruct\" the superhero form. Acclaimed titles such as Busiek's, Ross' and Brent Anderson's Astro City and Moore's Tom Strong combined artistic sophistication and idealism into a super heroic version of retro-futurism.

A variety of other disagreements existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal of the pope to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII \n\n Many in Rome still thought reconciliation with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned and sentenced to death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England. However, \"papal restoration in England was doomed even before it was accomplished\" when Mary I married Philip II of Spain. According to Wilkie, \"the cardinal protectors had assisted in the loss of England to the papacy, and Ireland remained loyal to the papacy in spite of them\".

Upstream is a 1927 American comedy film directed by John Ford. It is considered to be the first Ford film to show some influence of German director F. W. Murnau, who began working at Fox Studios in 1926. From Murnau, Ford learned how to use forced perspectives and chiaroscuro lighting, which the American director then integrated into his own more naturalistic and direct filmmaking style. these early films are considered lost, with Anger burning much of his previous work in 1967. It was here, he met Maxine Peterson, who had once been the stand-in for Shirley Temple, and he asked her &ndash; alongside another classmate and an older woman &ndash; to appear in his next film project, which he initially called Demigods, later retitled as Escape Episode. The following year he produced another amateur film, Prisoner of Mars, which was heavily influenced by Flash Gordon. In this science fiction-inspired feature, in which he played the protagonist, he added elements taken from the Greek mythological myth of the Minotaur and constructed a small volcano in his back yard to create a home-made special effect.

In comparative mythology as well, horned dragons are generally more common than hornless ones. Based upon the chishou \"hornless-dragon head\" roof adornment, Kroll translates chi as wyvern, \"a footed winged dragon with a serpent's tail, becoming in medieval times an oft-pictured heraldic beast.\" Two other Japanese examples derive from Buddhist importations of Indian dragon myths. Comparing folklore about polycephalic dragons and serpents, 8-headed creatures are less common than 7- or 9-headed ones. He is the oldest literary representation of the wild man, a recurrent motif in artistic representations in Mesopotamia and in Ancient Near East literature. The apparition of Enkidu as a primitive man seems to be an innovation of the Old Babylonian version (1300 - 1000 BC), as he was originally a servant-warrior in the Sumerian poems. Satow and Anderson have noted that the wani is usually represented in art as a dragon, and Toyo-tama-hime … who in one version of the legend changes into a wani, as her true form at the moment of child-birth, according to another changes into a dragon. Multi-headed dragons, like the 8-headed Orochi and 3-headed Trisiras above, are a common motif in comparative mythology. For instance, multi-headed dragons in Greek mythology include the 9-headed Lernaean Hydra and the 100-headed Ladon, both slain\n\nQuestion: What mythological beast has the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail and feet of a dragon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As part of the Museum's redevelopment project, both cars were relocated by specialist haulier from their position in the Museum's Spirit of Speed Gallery to the new Biffa Award Land Speed Record Gallery which opened in 2015. Thrust2 is a British designed and built jet propelled car, which held the world land speed record from 4 October 1983 to 25 September 1997. The “Land Speed Record” (LSR), which was valid for 12 years, 11 months and 11 days at that time, was 622.407mph (1001.667kph) over one mile (with a flying start). The record was set on October 23, 1970 by the American Gary Gabelich with Blue Flame, a rocket car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Richard Noble stepped up to \"bring back this record for Britain\". The time it took Richard Noble from the idea to the first concept to the successful record attempt was nine years. In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 1,019 km/h. The date of Andy Green's record came exactly a half century and one day after Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in Earth's atmosphere, with the Bell X-1 research rocket plane on 14 October 1947.

Daley was elected to a record sixth term as mayor by a landslide 59% margin. This was the first Chicago mayoral election since the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Only one other individual (Daley's son Richard M. Daley) has matched Daley's feat of winning six Chicago mayoral elections. His tenure as mayor began in 1924, when he defeated the incumbent Seymour Farmer. Webb's candidacy was supported by the city's business community, and his support base was located in the city's wealthy south-end. He served as mayor 1925-1927 and 1930-1934. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, became mayor in 1989, and was repeatedly reelected until he declined to seek re-election in 2011. He sparked debate by demolishing many of the city's vast public housing projects, which had deteriorated and were holding too many poor and dysfunctional families. New projects during Daley's administration have been designed to be environmentally sound, more accessible and better for their occupants.

The film makes these Left-wing platitudes about the evils of big business and how technology encroaches on jobs for humans... Jane is supposed to be an intellectual, yet she has absolutely no emotional range or depth... Director Rob Cobb missed the boat with this.

Surely someone with great visual flair should have at least made the film look interesting. The homeless man enters, and is revealed to be Donald, who asks for forgiveness, and acceptance back into the family, unveiling to Mindy and Nicholas the head of a renovator he had murdered to help Mindy. The three embrace, and the film ends with Donald saying, \"Now, what do you say we clean up these dead bodies, and start a family, huh?\" She replies, \"We all will die.

Inspired by desert tortoises that dig holes in which to cool themselves, Critzer dug out a home on the north side of the rock using dynamite. He engineered a rainwater collection system and a tunnel for ventilation. The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8 m. Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.

Wendell Flint, the author (with photographer Mike Law) of To Find the Biggest Tree, measured it in 1977 as follows:\n\n back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail). That was the estimated height of the tallest conifer ever well-documented, the Mineral Tree (Mineral, Washington), measured in 1924 by Dr. Richard E. McArdle, former chief of the U.S. Forest Service. The volume of that tree was 515 m3. The tallest living individual is the Brummitt (Doerner) Fir in Coos County, Oregon, 99.4 m tall. Only coast redwood and Eucalyptus regnans reach greater heights based on current knowledge of living trees: 379 and 331 feet (116 and 101* m), respectively.

The company was merged in 1923 with Metro Pictures to become Metro-Goldwyn Pictures, then renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after Louis B. Mayer took control.

Amundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier. The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was later named after these two men. During the expedition, Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau. Their goal was \"to get as far south in a straight line on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land\". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had been associated with the Discovery Expedition's scientific work. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas. Hillary's party reached the South Pole on 3 January 1958, and was just the third (preceded by Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912) to reach the Pole overland. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base, completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person after Scott to reach the South Pole overland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the boll weevil attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, \n\n Benjamin Neeve Peach (6 September 1842 – 29 January 1926) was a British geologist.

Mark Robinson went on to promote a similar \"Newport 69\" show with Jimi Hendrix and later became an attorney, practicing law with Melvin Belli. Al and Gary teamed up with Bill Quarry, Alfie Zaner and Rich Romello and produced the San Francisco International Pop Festival at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton on October 25–26, 1968. Refreshment and rest room facilities were less than adequate and the sound system was not powerful enough to carry the sound to everyone present.\" \"The highlight of the pop fest on the first day (Saturday) seemed to come when Country Joe closed the bill. The hour was late and Orange County officials were threatening to shut off the electricity when the band went on, \n\n for the '68 show was under $50,000, while Robinson paid Jimi Hendrix alone $100,000 for the '69 event. The lawsuit was over trade names and, within the last few days before the '69 show, the court ordered that Robinson had to use \"not affiliated with the Newport Pop Festival\" disclaimers in advertising. Otherwise, he would not have been able to stage a \"Newport 70\" show using that name.

She changed the name to the \"Chateau Lobrano d'Arlington\" and began to hire foreign girls to increase the appeal to upscale customers. At this point, she began making business deals with Tom Anderson who operated a nearby restaurant which he renamed the Arlington. Anderson caught wind of Alderman Story's ordinance to create a regulated prostitution district before most did, and he and Josie acquired choice properties on Basin Street near the entrance to the future Storyville area. In the 1860s, much of the area south of Pennsylvania Avenue and a few blocks east of the White House had become a disreputable slum known as Murder Bay, the home to an extensive criminal underclass and numerous brothels. During the American Civil War, so many prostitutes took up residence in Murder Bay to serve the needs of General Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac that the area became known as \"Hooker's Division.\" The two trapezoidal blocks sandwiched between Pennsylvania and Missouri Avenues (now the site of the National Gallery of Art) became home to such expensive brothels that it gained the nickname \"Marble Alley.\" Mary Ann Conklin, also known as Mother Damnable and Madame Damnable (1821&ndash;1873) was an American madam who ran Seattle's first brothel, the Felker House, a major means of funneling money from sailors and lumbermen into local businesses.\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the brothel in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Star Peter O'Toole, who portrayed both Miguel de Cervantes and his literary creation Don Quixote in the film, was only one of several who reportedly criticized Damiani's sets as being \"too depressing\"; however, the creators of the original stage production intended the physical look of it to be rather plain, as they specified in articles written for the original souvenir program of the show, so the drabness of the film's sets may have been quite intentional.

The tournament was held from Monday 20 June until Saturday 2 July 1927. In the late 1850s, bat and ball games had started to become highly known and the sport of baseball was starting to become an establishment at U.S. universities. The first intercollegiate baseball game took place in 1859 between Amherst College and Williams College. The popularity of collegiate baseball increased from this point, and by 1870, college teams were playing extensive schedules. The first intercollegiate cricket match took place in 1860 between Franklin & Marshall College and Millersville State Normal School. Track and field also grew in popularity during this time, and the first intercollegiate track and field event occurred in 1873. This competition \n\n The first organized college sports club was formed in 1843 when Yale University created a boat club. Harvard University then followed in their footsteps, creating a similar boat club a year later.

A retrospective newspaper article about Spitalny published in 1958 noted \"ridicule from all sides in show business and ... sour comments from his musician brothers that he was 'crazy'\" as he created \"the first all-girl band of any consequence ever organized.\" AYS was founded in 1964 by conductor Mehli Mehta (father of Zubin Mehta and Zarin Mehta), then Director of the Orchestra Department at UCLA. Of his reasons for founding AYS, Mehta said: \"It takes a lifetime to learn symphonic literature...

Soundstage wrote that \"not since Gone with the Wind has a motion picture created such universal excitement as My Fair Lady\", although Hepburn's casting in the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle was a source of dispute. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, \"Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes.\" Hepburn's portrayal of Holly Golightly is generally considered to be one of her most memorable and identifiable roles. The film received five nominations at the 34th Academy Awards; Best Actress (for Hepburn), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, winning, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for \"Moon River\". The website's critical consensus reads, \"It contains some ugly anachronisms, but Blake Edwards is at his funniest in this iconic classic, and Audrey Hepburn absolutely lights up the screen.\" The film was a box-office success, and Hepburn gained critical acclaim for her portrayal, unexpectedly winning an Academy Award for Best Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama in 1953.

The bridge stands 150 feet above the Nanaimo River; over 260,000 people have jumped since the site opened in 1990. Besides bungee jumping, WildPlay parks are made up of treetop activities involving high-ropes and obstacle climbing, swinging, and ziplining. In 1990, a permanent platform for bungee jumping was established by A. J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. The first parachute tower in the United States was a 115 ft tower in Ocean County, New Jersey, built by Stanley Switlik and first used by Amelia Earhart on 2 June 1935. The 262 feet Parachute Jump ride at the 1939 New York World's Fair (later moved to Coney Island) was a parachute tower, though the United States Army parachute training centre at Fort Benning had only 34 feet towers until 1941. Major William Lee of the United States Army, in charge of the training of the first 48-man platoon of US paratroopers, saw the Parachute Jump ride and constructed a similar tower at Fort Benning. While they initially offered traditional bungee jumping from a crane, their focus was to develop an idea Kitchen had for a safer alternative to bungee jumping that could be easily installed in amusement parks.

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. Chernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years, and, upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who was seven months older than Chernenko and just over three years older than his predecessor Andropov, is reported to have remarked \"How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?\" Beria became Deputy Prime Minister and retained overall nominal control over both MVD and MGB, which were both, however, now led by \n\nGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – Mikhail Gorbachev ; Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet – Andrei Gromyko ; Premier of the Soviet Union – Nikolai Ryzhkov ; Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union – Vladimir Terebilov \n\n On the day Khrushchev left for his vacation, East German Premier Willi Stoph made a sudden visit to Moscow and commenced an intensive three-day series of talks with Kosygin and other high-level Kremlin leaders. Then in rapid succession, Suslov and Brezhnev came forward with strong statements reassuring the East German leaders about Soviet intentions toward East Germany. Suslov made a flat no-sell-out pledge in Moscow on the same day (5 October) that Brezhnev was welcomed in East Berlin by Ulbricht, who had refused to greet Khrushchev's son-in law two months earlier.\n\nQuestion: Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Spock had mothers advised to raise their infants according to their own common sense and with plenty of physical contact – a guideline that radically broke with the preceding doctrines of L. Emmett Holt and John B. Watson; the book became a bestseller, and Spock's new child rearing concept greatly influenced the upbringing of the post-war generations. She argued that infants, speaking in terms of evolution, have not arrived in the modernity yet, so that today's way of child care – with bottle feeding, use of cribs and baby carriages, etc. Mothers placed the child in the cylinder, turned it around so that the baby was inside the church, and then rang a bell to alert caretakers. In 1984, developmental psychologist Aletha Solter published her book The Aware Baby about a parenting philosophy that advocates attachment, extended breastfeeding and abstinence from punishment, similarly to what William Sears later wrote; however, the point that Solter stressed most was an encouragement of the child's emotional expression in order to heal stress and trauma. In the 1990s, T. Berry Brazelton invigorated the discussion. He contributed new research about the capacity of newborn infants to express themselves and their emotions, sensitized parents for these signals, and encouraged them – just like Spock – to follow their own judgment.\n\nQuestion: In the late 60s Owen Finlay MacLaren pioneered what useful item for parents of small chldren?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Technically, Hayabusa was not designed to \"land\"; it simply touches the surface with its sample capturing device and then moves away. However, it was the first craft designed from the outset to make physical contact with the surface of an asteroid. Junichiro Kawaguchi of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science was appointed to be the leader of the mission. Despite its designer's intention of a momentary contact, Hayabusa did land and sit on the asteroid surface for about 30 minutes (see timeline below).

On April 8, 1925, he took on a younger Ace Hudkins, perhaps underestimating his talent, and received a painful defeat. He made the decision to retire, and was quoted as saying, \"If I can't beat a young kid like Hudkins with all my skill and experience, then I have no right to be a world champion.\" Salido was also criticized for failing to make weight and some sources stipulated that he did so intentionally, as well as coming back much heavier than Lomachenko on the fight night. - Machine Levine, Punch Lines Podcast\n\n As a professional fighter Sullivan was nicknamed The Boston Strongboy. As a youth he was arrested several times for participating in bouts where the sport was outlawed. He went on exhibition tours offering people money to fight him. There is some controversy among boxing historians over whether Sullivan had sparred with black boxer James Young at Schieffelin Hall in Tombstone, Arizona in 1882. It is significant because Sullivan insisted that he never fought a black boxer. If it did occur, Sullivan possibly had a brief sparring session with the resident from Tombstone, and \n\n and Joey Gamache all win boxing titles. He was the matchmaker responsible for the early career-building fights involving Mike Tyson and Tommy Morrison, and Tyson's late manager, Jimmy Jacobs, once said of Bos (from Peter Heller's Tyson biography, \"\"Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story\"): \"There are people who are geniuses in certain areas. Johnny Bos is a genius when it comes to shit.\" This was meant as a huge compliment, testament to Bos' knack for finding just the right opponents for an up-and-coming fighter. It was with Joey Gamache that Bos' career took a bad turn; not due to anything on Gamache's part.\n\nQuestion: \"Which boxer famously said,\"\" If I can't beat this bum take my name off the record books?\"\"\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Now 35 years old, world record holder and 1995 champion Jonathan Edwards lurked in second place with a 16.84m. Early in the second round Yoel Garcia moved into the lead with a 17.40m. Christian Olsson moved into second with a 17.28m. With his next jump, Olsson took the lead with a 17.47m. In his breakthrough year of 1995, Edwards produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5 1⁄2 inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes, but it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year with a historic gold medal performance \n\n Edwards was born in Westminster, London and attended West Buckland School in Devon where his potential for the triple jump was spotted at an early age. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him, The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier with a jump of 18.16 m (59 feet 7 inches). During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards observed that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if \"he could jump as far as he needed to\".

Born in Belize City, he spent parts of three seasons (1991 to 1993) with the Baltimore Orioles, hitting 13 home runs in his rookie season and posting a slugging percentage of .514 in 216 at bats. The minor league Orioles moved into Terrapin Park, a wooden ballpark. This move began a chain of events which would eventually lead to the return of major league baseball to Baltimore. As a result, several players, including the young left-handed pitcher Babe Ruth, were offered for sale to major league teams. In 1914, Ruth began his career with the Red Sox of the rival American League. After the demise of the Federal League and the Terrapins, Baltimore would not see major league baseball again until, when the former St. Louis Browns moved into town and became the present-day Baltimore Orioles. As the Terrapins' owners were not offered any part of the buyout offer \n\n Most of the professional baseball teams in Baltimore have been called the Orioles, in reference to the Baltimore oriole bird. There was already a minor league Baltimore Orioles, and the new Federal League club built their ballpark directly across the street from the Orioles park.

Mantle swung at the first pitch from Barney Schultz, a knuckleball that failed to move, and hit it into the right field stands to win the game for the Yankees. At first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth \n\n in the lineup.

The Red Sea sits a little higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal is an intermittent tidal strait discharging water into the Mediterranean. This is the Lessepsian migration, after Ferdinand de Lesseps, the chief engineer of the canal. to China. Sea trade was an important factor not just for the coastal ports and cities like Istanbul, but also for Baghdad and Iraq, which are further inland. Long distance sea trade imported raw materials for building, luxury goods for the wealthy, and new inventions. The boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal. This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa. The Trans-Suez Interchange is a human-induced biotic interchange between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea due to the construction of the Suez canal.

The common design consists of a blue strip on the left of the plate, which has the EU motif (12 yellow stars), along with the country code of the member state in which the vehicle was registered.

Massey told Baldwin that he had his full support in his demand that the king either give up his throne or Mrs. Simpson, through he also advised Baldwin that the king was popular in Canada, and many Canadians would not understand why the king could not marry Mrs. Simpson, saying the matter had to handled very carefully least it alienate the Canadian people from the monarchy.

In 1939, because Hatten was on the Maginot Line, the authorities had arranged for the town's 1,500 inhabitants to be evacuated to Châteauponsac in the Limousin region, six hundred kilometers to the southwest. However, after July 1940, the village had survived the invasion of France undamaged; therefore, the residents were able to return to Hatten, since the whole of Alsace had then reverted to its pre-1919 status as a part of Germany. On 30 June, at a meeting at Grand-Hohekirkel, Lt. Schiesseck and Otterbiel saw relatively little action in 1940 compared to their neighbors, and surrendered to the Germans with the rest of the Bitche fortifications on 30 June 1940. Following the surrender, Simserhof was used by the Germans as a storage facility for torpedoes. The hotel was purchased by the French government in 1936 to serve as offices for the Ministry of Defence. It served as the headquarters of the German military high command in France (Militärbefehlshaber Frankreich) from October 1940 to July 1944 during the occupation of Paris in World War II.

This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the chance to enforce its vision. One of the most successful exporters was Édouard Empain, nicknamed the \"Tramway King\", whose company ran infrastructure projects across Europe, Asia and South America. The construction of an elevated line like the Stadtbahn was ruled out because of extensive building along the route, and a tunnel would have been highly problematic in the steam age. In 1911, within the framework of a much broader competition for proposals for the further development of the city of Berlin, several proposals for such a north-south railway interconnection were set forth. The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle). The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations.\n\nQuestion: Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Several established artists started their own independent labels, including The Beatles' Apple Records, and The Rolling Stones' Rolling Stones Records. These labels tended to fail commercially or be acquired by the major labels. In the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the American music business changed as people began to more quickly learn the industry. From 1940s to 1950s, R&B indie labels such as Savoy, Apollo, King, Modern, Mercury, Imperial, Specialty, Red Robin, Duke and Vee-Jay Records were founded. During the 1960s, rock label Elektra, R&B labels such as Motown, Stax records released singles and albums. Labels such as London-American (now London Records), RCA Victor and Capitol were priced at a premium. One of the earliest UK record collectors was Mike Adams, who was first known for trading in 1958 on Merseyside. In the UK, labels considered collectible, such as Atlantic Records, Sun Records, Motown, and Parlophone (EMI), turned into mainstream major record labels later on in the 1960s.\n\nQuestion: On which label did Chuck Berry record in the 1950s and 1960s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Despite living separately, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018. Dibnah met his second wife Susan Lorenz—a 28-year-old social worker—at a steam rally in Cheshire.

How noble in reason! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in apprehension, how like a god! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?\" The same as in Nietzsche, contempt for the fleeting interests of the moment, the same impulse for the eternal and for beauty: 'Do not give your love and faith to world politicians,' said Schlegel in the 1800s. For the same Schlegel, it was worth 'for the divine world of knowledge and art, to sacrifice the deepest feelings of your soul in the sacred, the fiery current of eternal perfection.'\" But this unconscious continuation never reached the surface, where the conscious \n\n \"But if the faith communicated by the Church to Christian humanity is a living faith, and if the grace of the sacraments is an effectual grace, the resultant union of the divine and the human cannot be limited to the special domain of religion, but must extend to all Man's common relationships and must regenerate and transform his social and political life.\" [...] I found my key to this oeuvre in the theatrical text of Seneca.

Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert. The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005. The song was, alongside a corresponding message from Belgrade, conveyed by Mladen Popović, aired on Wembley Stadium during Live Aid concert, between Run–D.M.C. The primary venue in the building for the concert series is the Salon Simón Bolivar, an expansive room in the building’s Neo-Federal style with wide windows, a 15-foot ceiling, and wood-paneled and silk fabric walls. The concert was a cooperative and collaborative global effort between ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, UPN, and The WB. Approximately $30 million was raised for the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army. The event was produced by Joel Gallen and followed very closely in the footprints of America: A Tribute to Heroes, which raised money for the relief efforts from the aftermath of the September 11 attacks (both telethons had the Los Angeles segments at CBS Television City). U2 participated in the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium for Ethiopian famine relief on 13 July 1985. During the performance, Bono leaped down off the stage to embrace and dance with a fan.

Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. Its crew consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, and Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans. Launched at 12:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, Apollo 17 was a \"J-type\" mission that included three days on the lunar \n\n module pilot assignment to Schmitt, a geologist. It was also the final use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose (extra Apollo spacecraft were later used in the Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz programs). The mission broke several crewed spaceflight records, including the longest Moon landing, greatest distance from a spacecraft during an EVA of any type (7.6 kilometers, a record which still stands), longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours 4 minutes), largest lunar sample return (110.52 kilograms or 243.7 lb), longest time in lunar orbit (6 days 4 hours) and most lunar orbits (75).\n\nQuestion: Which was the longest moon landing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was decided to conduct the inauguration immediately, due to the tragic and politically charged circumstances of President McKinley's death. Approximately 50 dignitaries, family members and cabinet officials gathered in the front library for the inauguration, while Federal Judge John R. Hazel administered the oath. No photographic image exists of the ceremony itself, although the room was heavily photographed after the inauguration had concluded. After short remarks, Chuck Schumer ended his speech by asking everyone to stand for the swearing-in ceremony. This was twice the amount raised by any previous inauguration committee. Observers agree that the actual inauguration expenses would have been a fraction of that amount, and the advocacy group Public Citizen has been seeking to know what happened to the remaining funds. An unspecified amount had also been used for redecorating the White House and Vice President Mike Pence's Washington residence. Thomas Barrack, the committee chair, \n\n the Trump International Hotel during the planning of the inauguration. Wolkoff was personally paid about $500,000 for the inauguration.

As a result of recommendations made by the Foulkes Commission's report on health care, titled \"Health Security for British Columbians\" released in 1973, the Government of British Columbia created the Emergency Health Services Commission (EHSC), which in turn created the BC Ambulance Service on July 4, 1974.\n\n helped 24 motorists on that first Sunday and 171 by the end of the first month.

Paddle steamers such as the Geneva Cross were used as ambulance steamers. The term \"ambulance\" at this time denoted a medical organisation that provided field hospitals, transport and surgical operations, not the more limited modern use.

The Berlin assembly operation produced 1,177 Model Ts in 1926 and a further 2,594 during 1927 which was the Model T's final year: in August 1927 Model T production in Berlin ended, and it was nearly a year before, on 20 August 1928, Ford auto-production in Berlin recommenced, now of the Ford Model A. Ernest Pfennig, a Chicago dentist, became the first owner of a Model A on July 23, 1903; 1,750 cars were made from 1903 through 1904 during Ford's occupancy of its first facility: the Ford Mack Avenue Plant, a modest rented wood-frame building on Detroit's East Side. The car came as a two-seater runabout for $800 or the $900 four-seater tonneau model with an option to add a top. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). But the engine continued to be produced and sold to various consumer, industrial, military, and marine markets throughout the world until 1941. Although Ford .. was a pacifist, he was .. happy to supply the US Army with more than 12,000 of these vehicles,..\" and: \"There was no civilian production of the Model Ts between 1917 and 1918.\" Many remained in service into the 1930s.

He was referred to as Citizen Louis Capet during the four months just before he was executed by guillotine. When this policy of hiding and ignoring the kingdom's financial woes failed miserably, Louis dismissed and replaced him in 1783 with Charles Alexandre de Calonne, who increased public spending to \"buy\" the country's way out of debt. After this, \n\n time in his previous palace came to an end on 5 October 1789, when an angry mob of Parisian working men and women was incited by revolutionaries and marched on the Palace of Versailles, where the royal family lived.

As king, Louis XVI focused primarily on religious freedom and foreign policy. While none doubted his intellectual ability to rule France, it was quite clear that, although raised as the Dauphin since 1765, he lacked firmness and decisiveness. This convocation was one of the events that transformed the general economic and political malaise of the country into the French Revolution. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution.\n\nQuestion: Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language).

The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. In the 21st century, after 58 years of non-religious use, the cathedral is once again the setting for regular liturgical celebrations in multiple languages—Russian, Polish, Korean, English, French, Spanish, Armenian and Latin—as well as benefit concerts featuring organ and church music. The cathedral is listed as a heritage building in the Russian Federation, and is a protected monument. The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a cruciform pseudo-basilica with three naves and an apse. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911.

It is located between Suomenlinna and Santahamina. Some fortifications were built on the island, but while neighbouring Suomenlinna became the main sea fort for Helsinki, Vallisaari was a supply point where cattle was grazing and firewood was collected. Sweden and Russia were at war in 1808 and the Russians besieged Suomenlinna, they used Vallisaari as their base. When ruling the Grand Duchy of Finland Russians began developing fortifications in Vallisaari. After Finland gained its independence in 1917, weaponry of the Defence Forces was stored in Vallisaari until the 21st century. North Karelia (1:614) ; 2. South Karelia (1:760) ; 3.

From 1190 to 1192, Richard the Lionheart was on the Third Crusade. He was joined by Philip II of France as each was wary that the other might invade his territory in his absence. In Richard's absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip's conquests in the period of Richard's imprisonment was the Norman Vexin and a few towns around such as Le Vaudreuil, Verneuil and Évreux. The leaders of the crusade included John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, Leopold of Austria, the Grand Masters of the Hospitallers, the Templars and the Teutonic Knights. In early November, the Crusaders launched a campaign for the Jordan River, forcing Al-Adil I, Sultan of Egypt, to withdraw without fighting; the crusaders then pillaged Beisan. ; 1274 &ndash; Edward I of England returns from the Ninth Crusade and is crowned King seventeen days later. ; 1343 &ndash; After the execution of her husband, Jeanne de Clisson sells her estates and raises a force of men with which to attack French shipping and ports. William of Nevers also escaped to Tarsus and joined the rest of the survivors there as did Raymond of Toulouse. Under Raymond's command they captured Tortosa (Tartous), with help from a Genoese fleet. By now the crusade was more of a pilgrimage. Afterwards, many of them simply went home, their vow having been fulfilled, although some remained behind to help King Baldwin I defend against an Egyptian invasion at Ramla. Richard's ally, Philip II of France, is enraged at Richard's rejection of his sister Alice, but Richard defies Philip and the other troubled allies\n\nQuestion: Which crusade was led by Philip II Augustus of France and Richard I of England?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Court was established on 1 October 1838 and sits in The Hague, Netherlands. Hence the Netherlands has no constitutional court. In 1921, van Eysinga served on an arbitral panel led by Max Huber, tasked with settling a dispute between Germany and certain Dutch banks. He was the President of the Committee of Jurists asked by the Council of the League of Nations in 1925 to provide an opinion on a dispute between Danzig and Poland. Van Eysinga was the Dutch government's representative at the 1930 League of Nations Codification Conference, which purported to codify certain aspects of international law. In 1930, van Eysinga was elected by the Assembly and Council of the League of Nations to serve on the Permanent Court of International Justice. He started his term in 1931, serving until the dissolution of the Court in 1945. He died in Leiden on 24 January 1961. It has one court of first instance: the Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg, Curaçao, and an appeal court the Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, which it shares with the other Dutch entities in the Caribbean. No appeal is possible to decisions of the Joint Court of Justice, but fundamental \"questions of law\" may be submitted to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands and the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden in cassation. The headquarters of the ICC is in Paris, France. The judiciary comprises eleven district courts, four courts of appeal, two administrative courts (Centrale Raad van Beroep and the College van beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) and a Supreme Court that has 41 judges. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court of the Netherlands, Curacao, Sint Maarten and Aruba.

Harold marched his army back down to the south coast, where he met William's army, at a place now called Battle just outside Hastings. Harold was killed when he fought and lost the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. Once the battle is over, the clouds disperse, disclosing the field of Hastings, the night after the battle. In the centre is a hillock on which lie the body of King Harold and others. Duke William approaches with his men, and Malet announces that Harold died 'as heroes die, upon the field'. His men respond enthusiastically, and the standard-bearer replaces Harold's standard with that of William, while the nuns and monks remain kneeled round Harold's body. They marched towards York, where they were confronted, at Fulford Gate, by the English forces that were under the command of the northern earls, Edwin and Morcar; the Battle of Fulford followed, on 20 September, which was one of the bloodiest battles of medieval times. The English forces were routed, though Edwin and Morcar escaped. The victors entered the city of York, exchanged hostages and were provisioned. Hearing the news whilst in London, Harold Godwinson force-marched a second English army to Tadcaster by the night of the 24th, and after catching Harald Hardrada by surprise, on the morning of 25 September, Harold achieved a total victory over the Scandinavian horde after a two-day-long engagement at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.

Habsburg Castle (Schloss Habsburg) is a medieval fortress located in what is now Habsburg, Switzerland, in the canton of Aargau, near the Aar River. At the time of its construction, the location was part of the Duchy of Swabia. Habsburg Castle is the original seat of the House of Habsburg, which became one of the leading imperial and royal dynasties in Europe. The original coat of arms to fly over Habsburg Castle, a red lion on a golden field, remained part of the Austrian arms up to the end of the imperial period. The area around the castle was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed. Habsburg Castle itself, the original seat of the House of Habsburg, was taken by Bern in April 1415. The Habsburgs had founded a number of monasteries (with some structures enduring, e.g., in Wettingen and Muri), the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war – the \"Sonderbund War\" – in 1847. The castle was built around 1020 by Count Radbot, of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and Werner, Bishop of Strasbourg. They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276.

Hills and fog obstructed the view, and the column marched straight into the bulk of the French armies. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim. That day Davidovich routed Vaubois, but it was too late. Bonaparte's victory at Arcole permitted him to concentrate against Davidovich and chase him up the Adige valley. But without his colleague's support, the Austrian commander was too weak to continue the campaign and he withdrew again. Wurmser attempted a breakout, but his effort came too late in the campaign and had no effect on the result. While the battle ended in a French victory, with the Prussians in retreat and Grouchy firmly athwart Prussian lines of communication to the east, this victory proved hollow. The Prussians had held their ground long enough to allow Blücher's transfer of 72,000 troops to Wellington’s aid at Waterloo. Thus, for the Prussians, the battle was a strategic success, as it contributed to the decisive victory at Waterloo. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again. Stripping Vaubois and Kilmaine of every available man, Bonaparte fell upon Alvinczi at the Battle of Arcola on 15–17 November and defeated the Austrians.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Instrument of Government specified the numbers of members of parliament that boroughs and counties in England and Wales would send to the Parliament, totalling 400. This was the first systematic redistribution of Parliamentary seats in English history and would not be matched for a Royal Parliament until the Reform Act 1832. It elects one Member of Parliament at least once every five years using the first-past-the-post system of voting. It is currently represented by David Linden of the Scottish National Party who has been the MP since 2017. It was once one of the safest seats for the Labour Party, the areas included in the constituency having returned solely Labour MPs since the 1930s. However, it achieved national prominence when a by-election in 2008 saw the Scottish National Party overturn a majority of over 13,000 votes to gain the seat. 395 members elected directly for a five-year term.\n\nQuestion: In which parliament has the UK 87 seats for members who are elected for a five0-year term?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It then changed its name to the more descriptive Ecology Party in 1975, and to the Green Party ten years later. In 1991 Green Party spokesman and TV sports presenter David Icke created considerable embarrassment for the Party when he revealed his extreme political and spiritual beliefs. In 1991, attempts to streamline the Party Constitution were proposed by a group called Green 2000, who wanted to \"modernise\" the Party and make it into an organised electoral force that could become the ruling party in \n\n Council. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and shared control of Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration. In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008. According to MORI in 2010, Green issues were rated as importantly as during the Green Party's previous high point in the late 1980s. These internal constitutional wranglings, and negative public statements released by supporters of both Green 2000 and decentralists who ran the recall campaigns, seriously hampered preparations for the 1992 General Election, in which 253 Green candidates received 1.3% of the vote. The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour.\n\nQuestion: What was the former name of the British Green Party?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Apart from one-party-dominant and two-party systems, multi-party systems tend to be more common in parliamentary systems than presidential systems and far more common in countries that use proportional representation compared to countries that use first-past-the-post elections. First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the legislature, whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population's views. Proportional systems may have \n\n The random ballot, single stochastic vote, or lottery voting is an electoral system in which an election is decided on the basis of a single randomly selected ballot. It is closely related to random dictatorship;  the latter is a general rule for social choice, while random ballot is an application of this general rule for electing candidates in multi-constituency bodies. Whilst appearing superficially chaotic, the system has the potential to retain the most attractive characteristics of both first past the post and proportional representation systems in elections to multi-constituency bodies. Its application to elections was first described in 1984 by Akhil Reed Amar,. William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority.\n\nQuestion: \"What is the more common name of the \"\"simple plurality\"\" system of voting?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Charles Vignoles has also been associated with Novelty, but his practical involvement is not known. He may have aligned himself with the engine because of a continuing feud with George Stephenson. Atherton was a successful instrument and engine maker, who also designed and manufactured innovative machinery for the textile machinery during the eighteenth century.

The biographical drama with music portrays the singer as a self-destructive, promiscuous alcoholic and junkie who, in one controversial scene, urinates in public. He worked with lyricist Michel Vaucaire. In 1956 they wrote Non, je ne regrette rien, recorded in 1960 by Édith Piaf. That led to more than 30 songs for her, such as Flonflons du Bal, Mon Dieu and Les Amants which Piaf and Dumont wrote and sang together in 1962. Dumont tells in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques, by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the popular French singer Rosalie Dubois. When he finished there was a big silence, as they waited for Piaf's verdict. asked Piaf in a sharp voice. \"Formidable.

Shearing also opens fresh coal surfaces exposing reactive molecular species, which participate in new bond-forming reactions and liberate some chemically trapped moisture. When applied to lignite and some sub-bituminous coals, the Coldry process produces a feedstock in the form of densified pellets that significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared \n\n The chemical and calorific values of densified coal derived from typical Victorian brown coal with a natural average moisture content of 60 per cent by weight compares well with typical high grade black coal exported from Tarong Queensland, and Newcastle New South Wales Australia. The random reflectance (%Rr) of the coals is 0.47–0.56, indicating sub-bituminous coal. The coals are generally dominated by vitrinite macerals, except for a high percentage of inertinite. Despite initial success with the brown coal firing, Rhenanus was still not satisfied. The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. Maddingley Mine near Bacchus Marsh Railway Station, Victoria, Australia contains a concentration of a particular brown coal (lignite) formation called Leonardite. A relatively high altitude formation, Maddingley brown coal is distinguished as having 60 per cent moisture content and a rich fulvic acid and humic acid content.\n\nQuestion: What type of coal is brown and fibrous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Normally glass consists of 70% to 74% silica, 16% to 22% alkali and 5% to 10% of flux. The other components and mineral compounds from glass can leach out over time, causing iridescent rainbow patterns and flaking of the outer surface of glass\n\n which the core material was scraped out. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) \n\n A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the \"working period\" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale.

Its larvae develop in truffles, a behavior exploited in the search for truffles. In the autumn, the subterranean parts of the organism bloom \"honey mushrooms\" as surface fruits. A spatial genetic analysis estimated that an individual specimen of A. ostoyae growing over 91 acre in northern Michigan, United States, weighs 440 tons (4 x 105 kg). Another specimen in northeastern Oregon's Malheur National Forest is possibly the largest living organism on Earth by mass, area, and volume – this contiguous specimen covers 3.7 sqmi and is colloquially called the \"Humongous fungus\". Approximations of the land area occupied by the \"Humongous fungus\" are 3.5 sqmi (2240 acre), and it possibly weighs as much as 35,000 tons, making it the world's most massive living organism.

In seagrasses, this polymer has also been detected, but often in lower amounts compared to angiosperm land plants. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. Although the common backbone structure of land plant \n\n Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate with accounts 20% to 30% of the wood's cell. The major structural polymer in fungal cell walls is typically chitin, in contrast to plants and oomycetes that have cellulosic cell walls. Seagrass cell walls contain the same polysaccharides found in angiosperm land plants, such as cellulose However, the cell walls of some seagrasses are characterised by sulfated polysaccharides, which is a common attribute of macroalgae from the groups of red, brown and also green algae. Another unique feature of cell walls of seagrasses is the occurrence of unusual pectic polysaccharides called apiogalacturonans.

The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may \n\n support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced. To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:  Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's third law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's second law. They are therefore 'equal and opposite', yet they are acting \n\n of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.\n\nQuestion: What is the force that opposes the relative motion of two bodies that are in contact?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (0.225 m/s). This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at 1.86 m/s or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land animal, which has been clocked at a peak of 64 mph, scores at only 16 body lengths per second. Digitigrades include walking birds (what many assume to be bird knees are actually ankles), cats, dogs, and many other mammals, but not plantigrades or unguligrades. Digitigrades generally move more quickly and quietly than other animals. There are anatomical differences between the limbs of plantigrades, like humans, and both unguligrade and digitigrade limbs. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs, like Struthiomimus, the ratio is .68, but in Deinonychus the ratio is .48.

Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. In land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy. One of the requirements for productive farmland is adequate PAR, so PAR is used \n\n Green leaf volatiles (GLV) are volatile organic compounds that are released when plants suffer tissue damage. Some of these chemicals act as signaling compounds between either plants of the same species, of other species, or even vastly different lifeforms like insects. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide.\n\nQuestion: What is the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He then introduces the anatomy of birds, separating those with a cartilaginous stomach or gizzard, and those with a membranous stomach; those that incubate their young, and the cuckoo that does not; with remarks on instincts such as carrying shell fragments away from the nest, birdsong, and feet adapted for different purposes, such as climbing or swimming. In 1831, \"J. D.\" wrote to The Magazine of Natural History, and Journal of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology, and Meteorology about James Rennie's second edition \"to point out a few of its faults\". Next, \"J. D.\" attacked Rennie's \"use of system\", declaring himself disappointed, especially by Rennie's \"abuse\" of zoologists who were systematic. It was the first comprehensive field guide to Australian birds and included full-colour paintings of each species, setting the benchmark for all Australian field guides to come. To this end, he organised the birds by habitat, which made them easy to find and identify, and included concise information on bird distribution, behaviour and breeding.

Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids. Many marine organisms also contain alkaloids. Through the mycelium, a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by facilitated diffusion and active transport. They contribute to the organic fraction of soil, and their growth releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere (see carbon cycle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. The body tissues are composed of numerous types \n\n As a building block of lignocelluloses, such as pectin and lignin, ferulic acid is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom.\n\nQuestion: What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ethologist Konrad Lorenz was the first to describe the Kewpie doll effect and propose the effect's possible evolutionary significance, followed by the work of Thomas Alley in 1981. It is the study of animal forms of knowing. The field also differs from the field of animal communication in that it also interprets signs that are not communicative in the traditional sense, such as camouflage, mimicry, courtship behavior etc. The field also studies cross-species communication, for example between humans and animals. It was introduced by B. F. Skinner with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, humans and other species. Anthrozoology (also known as \"human–animal studies\") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the study of animal behavior?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Thus it is possible they form family groups of a male, female, and offspring. The litter size is 1–3. House mice usually run, walk, or stand on all fours, but when eating, fighting, or orienting themselves, they rear up on their hind legs with additional support from the tail – a behavior known as \"tripoding\". Mice are good jumpers, climbers, and swimmers, and are generally considered to be thigmotactic, i.e. They live in a wide variety of hidden places near food sources, and construct nests from various soft materials. The social unit of commensal house mouse populations generally consists of one male and two or more females, usually related. These groups breed cooperatively, with the females communally nursing. This cooperative breeding and rearing by related females helps increase reproductive success. In open areas such as shrubs and fields, the house mouse population is known as noncommensal. These populations are often limited by water or food supply and have large \n\n two or more males are housed together in a cage, they often become aggressive unless they have been raised together from birth. Mice are generally afraid of rats which often kill and eat them, a behavior known as muricide.

From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \"innominate vein\"). The subclavian vein follows the subclavian artery and is separated from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. As the subclavian vein is large, central and relatively superficial, the right subclavian vein is often used to place central venous lines. It is less commonly used than other approaches, such as the right internal jugular vein, due to the risk of pneumothorax, haemothorax, and puncture of the accompanying subclavian artery. The subclavian vein is a paired large vein, one on either side of the body, that is responsible for draining blood from the upper extremities, allowing this blood to return to the heart. The diameter of the subclavian veins is approximately 1–2 cm, depending on the individual.\n\nQuestion: What has a central vein called a midrib?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife \n\n Nycteris thebaica and warthogs. Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking voles and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus), whose hoards can contain up to 20 kg of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra-dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of \n\n the snow which allows them to walk more easily. Animals have a small window of opportunity to successfully reproduce and birth of their young has to coincide with the abundance of prey otherwise the food chain will be disrupted.

The name comes from the Greek words φυτόν (phyton), meaning 'plant', and πλαγκτός (planktos), meaning 'wanderer' or 'drifter'. Phytoplankton obtain their energy through photosynthesis, as do trees and other plants on land. This means phytoplankton must have light from the sun, so they live in the well-lit surface layers (euphotic zone) of oceans and lakes. In comparison with terrestrial plants, phytoplankton are distributed over a larger surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have markedly faster turnover rates than trees (days versus decades). Phytoplankton form the base of marine \n\n It prefers sharply drained conditions, and is suitable for cultivation in an alpine garden.

If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken. There may be an incomplete formation of the enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) that makes the teeth more vulnerable to caries (cavities). This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications. Like many mammals, gorgonopsians were heterodonts, with clearly defined incisors, canines, and postcanine teeth homologous with premolars and molars. The dental formula of the mandible is 4:1:4:5. The premolars are symmetrical and the crowns look like tricusped molars, with the central cusp being largest in premolars and molars, though the size difference is less great in the premolars. George Gaylord Simpson (1928, p. 71) noted that the teeth of Amphilestes are diagnosable in having “molar cusps high and slender, molar cingulum rising below the main cusp, molar enamel not pitted.\" distinct and rugose \"nasal protuberances\".

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, OGA inhibition with PUGNAc inhibited insulin-mediated glucose uptake. PUGNAc treatment also inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt T308 \n\n Dulaglutide binds to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, slowing gastric emptying and increases insulin secretion by pancreatic Beta cells. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to a meal. GLUT2 also carries glucosamine. When the glucose concentration in the lumen of the small intestine goes above 30 mM, such as occurs in the fed-state, GLUT2 is up-regulated at the brush border membrane, enhancing the capacity of glucose transport. Pulsatile insulin secretion from individual beta cells is driven by oscillation of the calcium concentration in the cells. Much like the cardiac pacemaker, the pancreas is connected to cranial nerve 10, and others, but the oscillations are accomplished by intrapancreatic neurons and do not require \n\nexcretion = (filtration + secretion) - reabsorption Glucose is not secreted, so excretion = filtration - reabsorption.

The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart. The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. The heart has the shape of a pyramid, with its apex pointing towards the left nipple while its base forms the posterior surface of the heart. Four valves are usually present in a mammalian heart and together they determine the pathway of blood flow through the heart. The four valves in the mammalian heart are two atrioventricular valves separating the upper atria from the lower ventricles – the mitral valve in the left heart, and the tricuspid valve in the right heart. The other two valves are at the entrance to the arteries leaving the heart these are the semilunar valves – the aortic valve at the aorta, and the pulmonary valve at the pulmonary artery.

Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy. sperm enters the follicle and fertilizes the egg, giving rise to an intrafollicular pregnancy. It has also been debated that an egg cell fertilized outside of the ovary could implant on the ovarian surface, perhaps aided by a decidual reaction or endometriosis. In very rare occasions the pregnancy may find a sufficient foothold outside the ovary to continue as an abdominal pregnancy, and an occasional delivery has been reported. These primordial follicles contain immature oocytes surrounded by flat, squamous granulosa cells (support cells) that are segregated from the oocyte's environment by the basal lamina. The supply of follicles decreases slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty \n\n The female pronucleus is the female egg cell once it has become a haploid cell, and the male pronucleus forms when the sperm enters into the female egg.

In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. All the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes. Cells in the SA node spontaneously depolarize, ultimately resulting in contraction, approximately 100 times per minute. Because the sinoatrial node is responsible for the rest of the heart's electrical activity, it is sometimes called the primary pacemaker. cells can become pacemakers. It is important to realize that these cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells. If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. They are used in ovulation induction by inhibiting the negative feedback of estrogen at the hypothalamus. As the negative feedback of estrogen is inhibited, the hypothalamus secretes GnRh which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete LH and FSH which help in ovulation. Either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (such as Lupron) may be used in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) using an infusion pump to simulate endogenous hormone production. Gonadotropins are protein hormones that stimulate the gonads (testes and ovaries). FSH and recombinant FSH analogues are mainly used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation as well as ovulation induction. There has been some controversy over the efficacy between extracted and recombinant FSH for ovulation induction; however, a meta-analysis of 14 trials among 1726 women found that there were no differences in clinical pregnancy or live birth outcomes.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). The name \"argon\" is \n\n  Sulfur dioxide is found on Earth and exists in very small concentrations and in the atmosphere at about 1 ppm. There, it reacts with water to form clouds of sulfuric acid, and is a key component of the planet's global atmospheric sulfur cycle and contributes to global warming. It has been implicated as a key agent in the warming of early Mars, with estimates of concentrations in the lower atmosphere as high as 100 ppm, though it only exists in trace amounts. The atmosphere of Io, a natural satellite of Jupiter, is 90% sulfur dioxide and trace amounts are thought to also exist in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The first atmosphere would have consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. The next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable \"second atmosphere\".

There have been considerations of using a special aerator for lakes called a \"Speece Cone\", some parts of the world that have eutrophic lakes use biological means such as Dyes, Enzymes, and Barley Hay to remedy algae issues in eutrophic lakes. One of the reasons the lake cannot support many fish is because of severe pollution from phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, as well as lack of circulation to the deeper parts of the lake. The phosphorus, nitrogen and ammonia collect in the lake water and the lake bed from polluted streams that run into the lake after passing through farm fields, barnyards and subdivisions. ; Algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer. ; Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber, also known as an algae turf scrubber. Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS).

Around 4,500 years ago, the capstone upon the summit of the Great Pyramid of Giza absorbed the energy released by the Tartarus Rotation (a monstrous sunspot that occurs every 4,000–4,500 years), and saved the earth from major flooding and catastrophic weather. This capstone was later divided up by Alexander the Great with one piece hidden in a booby-trapped location within each of the other seven wonders of the world. If and when they are reunited and replaced on the capstone during another solar event, they can bring 1,000 years of peace or power for the nation which possesses them.

As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at Alexandria he saw it ascend as far as 7 1⁄2 degrees above the horizon (the meridian arc between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes).

He proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality, and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. It is a theistic answer to the question of how the universe comes to exist. It is in contrast to Ex nihilo nihil fit or \"nothing comes from nothing\", which means that all things were formed from preexisting things; an idea by the Greek philosopher Parmenides (c.540-480 BC) about the nature of all things, and later more formally stated by Titus Lucretius Carus (c. 99 – c. 55 BC)\n\n The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles appears in many ancient cultures such as those of Greece and India. The word atom is derived from the ancient Greek word atomos (a combination of the negative term \"a-\" and \"τομή,\" the term for \"cut\") that means \"uncuttable\". This ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning; modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts.

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 76 known moons \n\n the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus, which emits jets of gas and dust from its south-polar region, and Iapetus, with its contrasting black and white hemispheres. All of these moons are thought to have been captured asteroidal or perhaps comet bodies, possibly fragmented into several pieces. Two more were discovered in 2016 by the team led by Scott S. Sheppard at the Carnegie Institution for Science, bringing the total to 69. Among these is Valetudo, which has a prograde orbit, but crosses paths with several moons that have retrograde orbits, making an \n\n in Saturn's rings. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium.

It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. The galactic year, also known as a cosmic year, is the duration of time required for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph) within its trajectory around the galactic center, a speed at which an object could circumnavigate the Earth's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds; that speed corresponds to approximately 1/1300 of the speed of light. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies. It is located near the border of the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius, about 5.6° south of the ecliptic, visually close to the Butterfly Cluster (M6) and Shaula. Observations of several stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, particularly star S2, have been used to determine the mass and upper limits on the radius of the object. Based on mass and increasingly precise radius limits, astronomers have concluded that Sagittarius A* is the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.\n\nQuestion: What is the Milky Way?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of geodesics. As a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit gravitational waves, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like many other aspects of relativity) has been experimentally confirmed by astronomers—most dramatically in the direct detection of gravitational waves originating from a black hole merger when they passed through LIGO in 2015. They also describe the bending of light in a gravitational field, another prediction famously used as \n\n Though classically spacetime appears to be an absolute background, general relativity reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry.

This was officially recorded in the 1906 revision of the Convention. However, according to jurist and Red Cross historian Pierre Boissier, no clear evidence of this origin has been found; the concept that the design was chosen to complement the country in which the convention at which it was adopted was held, was also promoted later to counter the objections of Turkey that the flag was a Christian symbol. In the corners were gold anchors (top left, bottom right) and Iron Crosses (top right, bottom left). On the other side was an Iron Cross in the centre, with gold eagles replacing the two Iron Crosses in the corners. The flag was fringed in gold. It was renewed in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and in World War I. It also appeared in the canton of the war flag of the German Empire. The royal standard of Prussia showed the Iron Cross charged with the shield and crown of the small state arms surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Black Eagle. On the blades of the cross is the motto Gott mit uns.

Players can also compete against another human player or play Round the Clock, throwing darts around the dartboard from 20 to 1 within a time limit. The two darts players on the winning team face a target divided into nine sectors of decreasing size, each corresponding to a successively higher percentage of the jackpot. The professional has two minutes to hit the inner rings on as many sectors in sequence as possible, starting with the lowest value and working clockwise, and may only throw three darts at a time. Each team then has 45 seconds to throw darts and hit as many unlit targets in sequence as possible, starting directly above the last one lit on their side. At the start of each episode, the professionals are given 90 seconds to hit as many of the double scoring areas on a standard dartboard as possible, in ascending order starting with 1. The players alternate turns, with three throws per turn, and the clock starts when the double-1 is hit; each player must retrieve their darts from the board before the other can throw.

The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. Fairbanks is the only large city in the region. The Denali State Park wilderness draws many different types of visitors for many different reasons. It gives many opportunities to explore for backpackers, campers, canoers, families, fishermen, kayakers, rock climbers, and just people driving through. Denali is one of the main attractions, and there are easy-to-reach lookout points for visitors driving through. The Talkeetna Mountains to the east also offer different levels of climbing and backpacking experiences. Divided by a large valley, \n\n are many different views of Alaska looking in either direction. This terrain also offers many small lakes which are easy to hike to and visit.

Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles.

He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; \"to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development.\" Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. was flowing not only through the filament but also through the evacuated bulb, a phenomenon initially reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. That is, \n\n While working for the inventor Thomas Edison at Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Hammer was in charge of testing early electric light globes in 1880 through 1881. In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC).

They may also experience poor speech, pain and dissatisfaction with the appearance, lowering their quality of life. Bruxism, which is an abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterised by jaw clenching and tooth grinding, is also a causative factor in the development of dental issues, including tooth mobility. Although it cannot cause periodontium damage in itself, bruxism is known to be able to worsen attachment loss and tooth mobility if periodontal disease is already present. Moreover, pre-existing plaque-induced periodontitis can also cause occlusal trauma to increase the rate of connective tissue loss, which in turn may increase tooth mobility.

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful \n\n substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. Nobel's will expressed a request, to the surprise of many, that his money be used for prizes in physics, \n\n Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as \"dynamite\".\n\nQuestion: The invention of what in 1867, made Alfred Nobel famous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). The fried sweet potatoes tradition dates to the early nineteenth century in the United States. Sweet potato fries or chips are a common preparation, and are made by julienning and deep frying sweet potatoes, in the fashion of French fried potatoes. Roasting sliced or chopped sweet potatoes lightly coated in animal or vegetable oil at high heat became common in the United States at the start of the 21st century, a dish called “sweet potato fries”. In France, it may derive from an ethnic name for an inhabitant of the country; a variant is Lafrance. In the Czech Republic, the surname may relate to the word Franc. In Austria and Germany, deep-fried spring rolls are called Frühlingsrolle, while the Vietnamese salad rolls are called Sommerrolle (\"summer roll\"). The French call them nem for the fried ones, and rouleaux de printemps for the others, whereas in Poland they are known as sajgonki, named after Saigon, the city from which many of the Vietnamese immigrants in Poland originated. The French had refused to endorse the US invasion of Iraq, which happened without UN's approval, triggering an intense wave of anti-French sentiment, which culminated in the call to rebrand French fries, \"freedom fries.\"\n\nQuestion: From which country do French fries originate?

Scared, she hears footsteps approaching the bedroom and hides under the blanket. From under the blanket, the woman looks towards the power strip it is plugged in to. The flickering stops. The hallway light clicks back on and she sees it is on again and the door is only slightly ajar again. She is relieved, but unfortunately suddenly sees a monstrous humanoid with all-white eyes and an open mouth at her bedside table. It turns off the lamp, and the screen goes dark. But the strangest of all, Rusty goes downstairs in the middle of the night and turns on the living room light switch. Every time he flips the switch, the living room is replaced with an ancient-looking torture chamber. However, when Rusty (who was talking the whole time) gets back into the living room, three hours have passed. But when Lisa gets her pillow, the living room doors slam shut and lock. Susy is found, unharmed, behind the refrigerator door, while the dead Roat rests nearby, disabled by a toppled shelf. On a dark and rainy night, a woman (Lotta Losten) comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, which causes a long-haired, humanlike silhouette to become visible at the other end of the hallway. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it is inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning. The woman goes to bed, leaving the lamp on her bedside table on and the door leading to the lit hallway ajar.\n\nQuestion: Mary has a large bedroom and the only light switch is on the wall approximately 20 feet away from her bed.

It has been cited as the longest word in the English language (excluding coined and technical terms), although some dictionaries do not recognize it because of its low usage in everyday lexicon. The longest word found in a major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, but this is a technical term that was coined specifically to be the longest word. The word became known in the public realm in the United States via a popular television show in the 1950s, The $64,000 Question, when a young contestant correctly spelled it to win. It is indeed unambiguous as there exists only one nth last letter. A word  can not be reduced. The concept ultimately came to be called a \"type-writer\" in 1874. The only \"word processing\" these mechanical systems could perform was to change where letters appeared on the page, to fill in spaces that were previously left on the page, or to skip over lines.\n\nQuestion: What is the longest word can be typed using only the top row of letters on a typewriter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An arrangement often found in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half the total number of floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; for example a lift of a 24-storey building would only stop at 12 levels, with staircases used to access the \"upper\" or \"lower\" level from each intermediate landing. As the others look on, the lady of the apartment remarks that the injury serves him right for ruining her room and the elevator man adds that he knew that George would get into trouble because he was too curious. traffic necessitates a second lift the alternate floors strategy is sometimes still applied, not only for the doorway reduction but also, provisionally upon the passengers preferring no particular floor beyond capacity, it tends toward halving the total delay imposed by the stops en-route. Sometimes, two elevators are divided so that all floors are served, but one elevator only serves odd floors and the other even, which would often be less efficient for passengers, but cheaper to install because the group control of elevators was more complex than single control.

In the afternoon when he comes home, he gets into the elevator and goes straight to the 20th floor. However, if it is a sunny day he goes down to the ground floor in the morning, but when he comes home he only goes up to the 10th floor and then walks up 10 flights of stairs.

The word \"soccer\" was a recognised way of referring to Association football in the UK until around the 1970s, when it began to be perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. For fans who are more interested in other codes of football, within their sporting community, the use of the word 'football' may refer to \n\n The Football League was founded in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. It originally consisted of a single division of 12 clubs (Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke (now Stoke City), West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers), known as The Football League. For the next 100 years, the First Division was the top professional league in English football. The Football League \n\n With the parks being turned into anti-aircraft gun sites and with most young people becoming involved in the war effort and going into the services, very little football was played. After end of the World War II football activities were resumed and Sunday league football attracted interest again with more London leagues being founded: the Southern Sunday League in 1944, Hackney and Leyton, and Hampstead & District (later renamed to Camden Sunday League) in 1947, Wandsworth and District in \n\n London entered the National Football League in 1993 and were initially fairly successful with 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses in their first campaign and the renewed effort coincided with a drive to establish the games in schools. However even within such sporting communities an unqualified mention of 'football' would usually be a reference to association football. In its heartlands, rugby league is referred to as either \"football\" or just \"league\".\n\nQuestion: What is the only football league team in Britain which doesn't have any of the letters from the word football in its name?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, highly militaristic Konbaung kings had built the largest empire in mainland Southeast Asia until they encountered the British in present-day northeast India. By the 1770s Taksin had won back the old Ayutthayan core territories, and was resisting renewed Burmese incursions and in the process also expanding Siam’s influence further to the Lao areas of north, north-east, and east. Meanwhile, the Siamese garrison at Chiang Mai was holed up in a deserted city, and its troops were constantly ambushed by resistance forces whenever they ventured out of the city. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai, and returned. After the 1786 war, Siam consolidated its control of Lan Na, and in 1794, took over the Laotian state of Luang Prabang, its erstwhile ally against the Burmese. In response, Burma sent in a small expedition in 1797 to Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang to check the Siamese but it failed to make any impression. Undeterred, the Siamese army invaded Burmese territories of Kengtung and Kenghung (Sipsongpanna) in November 1803, laying siege to both towns. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had temporarily defeated Siam (1765–1767), subdued much of Laos (1765) and defeated four invasions by Qing China (1765–1769). Burma and Siam went to war until 1855 but after decades of war, the two countries exchanged Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Siam).\n\nQuestion: Which Asian country was once called Siam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee. The sciatic nerve, also called the ischiadic nerve, is a large nerve in humans and other vertebrate animals which is the largest branch of the sacral plexus and runs alongside the hip joint and down the lower limb. The sciatic nerve has no cutaneous branches for the thigh. The femur is the only bone in the thigh and serves as an attachment site for all muscles in the thigh. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After receiving criticism for the story being \"offensive\" and appropriating the grief of losing a child, Card put a disclaimer at the end of the short story and his novel was written in the third-person. The novel received praise for its \"easy and natural prose\" and its genuine and uplifting themes. Eugene England criticized the novel for its theology and the manner in which it deals with \"religious, theological, and moral issues\", stating that Card is at his best when he writes science fiction; however, he admitted that Card is a good storyteller. The novel won the 1992 Association of Mormon Letters Award for Best Novel. Though he garnered fame for his books Fuel-Injected Dreams and Boy Wonder, after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, Tim and Pete, he faced increasing difficulty having his work published. Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. Henriques, in his foreword, praises Blyton for her treatment of this subject, and stresses the negative effects of broken homes on children – one of the major themes of this novel. Lost Boys (1992) is a horror novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Dealing with themes such as religion and the nature of good and evil, the novel is an expansion of Card's short story \"Lost Boys\".\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the novels About A Boy, How To Be Good and High Fidelity?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Another ten-track soundtrack, Friendship Is Magic: Pinkie's Party Playlist, was released on iTunes on July 7, 2016, featuring select songs from the show's fourth and fifth seasons, as well as a re-recorded version of the \"Pony Pokey\" song from season one. The show's theme, written and arranged by longtime Hollywood composer Vic Mizzy, is dominated by a harpsichord and a bass clarinet, with finger snaps as percussive accompaniment. Ted Cassidy punctuated the lyrics with the words \"neat\", \"sweet\" and \"petite\". Mizzy's theme was released by RCA Victor as a 45-rpm single, although it failed to chart in the U.S. The song was revived for the 1992 animated series, as well as in 2007 for a series of Addams Family television commercials for M&M's chocolates. The closing theme is similar, but is instrumental and features such instruments as a triangle, a wood block, a siren whistle and a duck call replacing some of the finger snaps. The show's opening theme song is Pink Floyd's Time. The song played over the end credits is \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the 1959 Western Rio Bravo. ; The song playing in the Crazy Horse club when Adrianna walks in on Tony and Ralph in her office is \"Can't Stand It\" by The Greenhornes.\n\nQuestion: The theme tune to which TV show starts with the line Stick a pony in me pocket?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Working as a physicist and chemist, she conducted pioneering research on radioactive decay and was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics and became the first person to receive a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Marie Skłodowska-Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel prize in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel prize winner in 1911, both for her work on radiation. In 1933, Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences Haitinger Prize. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but she was able to return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen \n\n fractional crystallization process.

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles. At the lowest extreme, an allele can be a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent \n\nNeutrophil: Neutrophils are the most common white blood cells in normal adult blood.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. In Catesby's view, however, James had reneged on his promises, and he had quickly lost patience with the new Stuart Dynasty. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House of Lords \n\n Guy Fawkes is a 1923 British silent historical film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Matheson Lang, Nina Vanna and Hugh Buckler.

In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells. The string is traditionally made of horse hair but, sometimes, metal strings and strings made out of wood fiber are also used. The psalmodicon (psalmodikon or salmodikon) is typically a single-stringed musical instrument, developed in Scandinavia for simplifying music in churches and schools, and providing an alternative to the fiddle for sacred music. The instrument could be plucked or bowed. The Stroh violin is much louder than a standard wooden violin, and its directional projection of sound made it particularly useful in the early days of phonographic recording. Wooden violins recorded poorly with the early acoustic-mechanical recording method, and the Stroh violin improved this by producing a fuller, louder sound. The Stroh violin or Stroviol is a type of stringed musical instrument that is mechanically amplified by a metal resonator and horn attached to its body. The name Stroviol refers to a violin, but other instruments have been modified with the amplification device, including the viola, cello, double bass, ukulele, mandolin, and guitar.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the device made of wood and horsehair that is used to play a violin?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. A shorter ribbon of the same style is on the bottom of the flag, this time with the word \"TEXAS\". The emblem is centered on a blue field, which represents sincerity. In terms of measurements, the total flag's proportions are 3 by 5. The emblem measures 26 inches horizontally and 24 inches vertically. Modified versions are worn on the officers' evening dress uniforms, with the scarlet flanked with gold trim, and on members of the Marine Band, which wear the traditional red stripe with a white stripe in the center. The flag is dominated by a green, elongated and rigid letter \"E\" upon a white background.

In 1992, Bush had supported Cheney as a replacement for Dan Quayle on his father's ultimately unsuccessful national ticket.

Bianco's brother-in-law introduced him to Mount Rushmore designer Gutzon Borglum, and Bianco began working at Borglum's studio. In 1933, Borglum hired Bianco as chief stone carver on the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Paid $1.50 an hour, Bianco was charged with carving the detail in the faces. Before Mount Rushmore Bianco worked on Stone Mountain and Wars of America memorial with Borglum. On September 16, 2017, the National Park Service unveiled a memorial plaque at Mount Rushmore. The plaque acknowledged Luigi Del Bianco's crucial role as the only chief carver on the work.\n\nQuestion: Which four presidents heads are sculpted on Mount Rushmore?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The second syllable is an orthodox ending, and pinaud is the name of a well-known small Burgundy grape.\" The term \"piquette\" has also been used as a nickname for French wine of low quality. These wines often had a slight fizz which would prickle the mouth. Wines considered to be simple or bad quality are still sometimes referred to as \"piquette\" in French. The 1657 Lexicon Chymicum, by William Johnson glosses the word as \"antimonium sive stibium.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum\". Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. According to the historical-etymological dictionary of Canary dialect, by Marcial Morera, it derived from the Latin American Spanish word “bochinche” (derived from “buche” – “sip, gulp”), which means 'a poor tavern'. \", that is if there was a party nearby (or a stand or shop) set up to taste the wine before finally making the purchase.

Females give birth to litters containing two to five young around early spring. Gestation lasts around two months (63 days). Weaning takes place between 45 and 60 days, with the young reaching full maturity around one year of age. Capuchins can mate year-round but females will give birth every two years. A female’s gestation period is 150-180 days and give birth to one infant. Males reach maturity and are fertile around 6-8 years. This is the longest maturation period of any of the apes.

Some versions are extended to four minutes or more in length and few, if any, are as brief as Newman's original rendition. The song is unconventionally built on a modern trap beat, and samples John Lee Hooker's song \"Boom Boom\". A repeated phrase throughout the song, \"all day long I'd bidi-bidi-bum,\" is often misunderstood to refer to Tevye's desire not to have to work. However, in an interview with Terry Gross, Sheldon Harnick said he basically made up syllables that he thought would give the effect of Chassidic chanting. I first heard the song by 50s folkies The Weavers. It was written for a mining dispute in Harlaw County in the 30s. Dick Gaughan re-worked it for an eighties miners album. The album's opening track, \"First We Take Manhattan\" (originally called \"In Old Berlin\"), deals with geopolitical ideas, specifically extremism, as he explained himself in a backstage interview: \"Take This Waltz\" was originally released as part the 1986 Federico García Lorca tribute album Poets in New York (Poetas en Nueva York) and as a single.

It was released on February 3, 2008 by Big Machine Records and Republic Records as the fourth single from Swift's self-titled debut studio album (2006). It was inspired by the narcissistic and cocky nature of her former high school classmate and ex-boyfriend Jordan Alford with whom Swift never established a formal relationship. In retrospect, Swift has stated that she has evolved on a personal level and as a songwriter, claiming she processed emotions differently since \"Picture to Burn\". The campaign was fuelled by Jeff Buckley fans' dislike of The X Factors commercialism and the song's arrangement, as well as a desire by this contingent to introduce younger music fans to Buckley's version.

This is explained at \n\n The Pink Panther is an American media franchise primarily focusing on a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963. Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini. The first film in the series had an animated opening sequence, created by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, featuring \"The Pink Panther Theme\" by Mancini, as well as the Pink Panther character. The cartoon series gained its highest profile on television, aired on Saturday mornings as The Pink Panther Show. Henry Nicola Mancini (born Enrico Nicola Mancini; April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994) was an American composer, conductor, arranger, pianist and flautist. Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film, he won four Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and twenty Grammy Awards, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His works include the theme and soundtrack for the Peter Gunn television series as well as the music for The Pink Panther film series (\"The Pink Panther Theme\") and \"Moon River\" from Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mancini enjoyed a long collaboration composing film scores for the film director Blake Edwards. 1 hit single during the rock era on the Hot 100: his arrangement and recording of the \"Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet\" spent two weeks at the top, starting with the week ending June 28, 1969.\n\n reprise for many of the Pink Panther series entries, as well as the cartoon series, Mancini composed different theme music for A Shot in the Dark; this theme was later adopted by the animated spin-off series The Inspector.

Holly, Valens and Richardson left The Surf immediately after the show, going to the nearby Mason City airport and chartering a small plane to take them to Fargo, North Dakota to prepare for their next show at the Moorhead Armory in Moorhead, Minnesota. A concrete monument was erected outside The Surf, and the ballroom is adorned with large pictures of the three musicians. A street flanking the facility's east property line is named Buddy Holly Place in his honor. Richard Steven Valenzuela (May 13, 1941 – February 3, 1959), known professionally as Ritchie Valens, was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. A rock and roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens was killed in a plane crash eight months into his music career. On February 3, 1959, on what has become known as \"The Day the Music Died\", Valens died in a plane crash in Iowa, an accident that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, as well as pilot Roger Peterson. After the February 2, 1959, performance in Clear Lake, Iowa (which ended around midnight), Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the Mason City airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane because he won a coin toss with Holly's backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Holly's bassist, Waylon Jennings, voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to J.P.

Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.

The Century still attracted some of the best fiction authors of the day, however. He wrote a series of editorials in which he laid out his thoughts on the future of Western civilization. Upon the death of Charles Darwin in 1883, however, The Century published a laudatory tribute to the scientist written by Alfred Wallace. Over the years, The Century published works by a large number of writers who were agnostics or atheists, including famous skeptic Bertrand Russell.\n\nQuestion: Which scientist was Time magazine's \"Person of the 20th Century\"?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ruddy had been recommended to the Saints by Dick Neal who had played alongside him briefly at Derby County. Like Neal, his fee was partially met by the Saints' Supporters Club. Ruddy made his debut on 24 December 1932, when \n\n to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month. On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club Bristol City, and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over Carlisle United, and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion. John Thomas Gordon Ruddy (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United, before signing for Everton as a 19-year-old. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League. The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017. Ruddy had a trial at Manchester United in November 2004, before moving to Everton in the summer of 2005 for a fee of around £250,000 that would rise depending on appearances.\n\nQuestion: What was the nickname given to premiership footballer Neil Ruddock?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As \n\n The KTM 200 Duke is a 199.5 cc single-cylinder\tstandard motorcycle made by KTM since 2012. In Argentina, is being assembled by the company Simpa S.A. since March 2014. In the Philippines, it is being assembled by the company KTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing, Inc. (KAMMI) in Sta. Despite its Italian name, the Piatti scooter was of Belgian (and later, British) manufacture, being originally produced in 1954 in Belgium by D'Ieteren. According to Erwin Tragatsch in a brief entry on the Piatti scooter in his Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, Cyclemaster \"failed to find many customers for this product\", and manufactured only a small number before British production terminated. The Ducati 899 Panigale is a 898 cc sport bike from Ducati, released in 2013 to replace the 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter. The 899 surprised observers by topping sales charts for all motorcycles in the UK for December 2013, at a price five times higher than the number two seller, the Honda CBF125 — a situation compared by The Telegraph to the Ferrari California outselling the Ford Focus. For 2016, Ducati revised the 899, including enlarging the engine to 955 cc (the 959 Panigale). The Ducati Panigale V2 is a 955 cc (58.3 cu in) sport bike manufactured by Ducati as the successor to the Panigale 959. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale.

Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life.

The Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610. The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century, whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12). Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name Amalthea by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. In particular, the then known seven satellites were named after Titans, Titanesses and Giants—brothers and sisters of Cronus. When in the 20th century the names of Titans were exhausted, the moons were named after different characters of the Greco-Roman mythology or giants from other mythologies. All the irregular moons (except Phoebe) are named after Inuit and Gallic gods and after Norse ice giants. Some asteroids share the same names as moons of Saturn: 55 Pandora, 106 Dione, 577 Rhea, 1809 Prometheus, 1810 Epimetheus, and 4450 Pan. In addition, two more asteroids previously shared the names of Saturnian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the International Astronomical Union (IAU): Calypso and asteroid 53 Kalypso; and Helene and asteroid 101 Helena.\n\nQuestion: Which planet has moons named after Shakespearean characters?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date. The new film would have nothing but the title in common with Van Lustbader's novel, and would be a side-story with a new character \"in the mold of Bourne\", dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third film. The Bourne Sanction is the title for the novel by Eric Van Lustbader and the sixth novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum. It is Lustbader's third Bourne novel, following The Bourne Betrayal that was published in 2007. The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, The Last Testament (2007), set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process. His sixth Bourne novel, To Kill a President, was published by HarperCollins on 4 July 2017. The Bourne Legacy is a 2004 spy fiction thriller written by Eric Van Lustbader. It is the fourth novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum and the first to be written by Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Aside from these women, the three Synoptic Gospels speak of the presence of others: \"the chief priests, with the scribes and elders\"; two robbers crucified, one on Jesus' right and one on his left, whom the Gospel of Luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief; \"the soldiers\", \"the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus\"; passers-by; \"bystanders\", \"the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle\"; and \"his acquaintances\". The Gospel of John also speaks of women present, but only mentions the soldiers and \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\". The Gospels also tell of the arrival, after the death of Jesus, of Joseph of Arimathea and of Nicodemus. Chapter two opens with Jesus, his mother and his disciples present in Galilee, in the village of Cana. The second/third century theologian Origen suggested this was the third day from the last-named day in and the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary argues that it would take Jesus three days to travel from Bethabara in Perea to Cana in Galilee,. Lutheran pietist Johann Bengel suggests that this was the third day after the promise given to Nathaniel at the end of chapter 1, but also that the sign given in Cana was \"a specimen of its fulfilment\", whereas the 19th century theologian Heinrich Ewald suggested the third day would be reckoned from Jesus' arrival in Cana. There are several details that are only mentioned in a single gospel account. The three Synoptic gospels also describe Simon of Cyrene bearing the cross, a crowd of people mocking Jesus along with the thieves/robbers/rebels, darkness from the 6th to the 9th hour, and the temple veil being torn from top to bottom. The Synoptic Gospels also mention several witnesses, including a centurion, and several women who watched from a distance, two of whom were present during the burial. They are visited by wise men who bring gifts to the newborn Messiah.\n\nQuestion: The Bible tells of 3 wise men visiting Jesus after his birth, but in which of the Gospels does this appear?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The oldest of the group by some years, Athos is described as noble and handsome but also taciturn and melancholy, drowning his secret sorrows in drink. He was once married to Milady \n\n A young man named d'Artagnan leaves home to travel to Paris, with the intention to join the Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he befriends the three most formidable musketeers of the age — Athos, Porthos and Aramis — and gets involved in affairs of the state and court. Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Athos, Count de la Fère, is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers (1844), Twenty Years After (1845) and The Vicomte de Bragelonne (1847–1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père.

They connected to long toes tipped with pointed claws, with the fourth toe being the longest. The fifth (outermost) metatarsal is much shorter and broader, acquiring a \"hooked\" shape. According to Olson (1979), the fifth toe of the foot may have had an elongated metatarsal-like first phalanx (toe bone) to counteract the shrunken fifth metatarsal. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \"hands\" and \"feet\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs). The pastern bone of a sheep, goat, or calf has two rounded ends upon which it cannot stand and two broad and two narrow sides, one of each pair being concave and one convex. The convex narrow side, called chios or \"the dog\", was counted as 1, the convex broad \n\n the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and \n\n can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe.

The tip of the hook \n\n wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear. The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly \"figure 8\" cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. In rail terminology, a fishplate, splice bar or joint bar is a metal bar that is bolted to the ends of two rails to join them together in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship's mast. In rail transport modelling, a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity. A split pin, also known in the United States of America as a cotter pin or cotter key, is a metal fastener with two tines that are bent during installation, similar to a staple or rivet. The British definition of \"cotter pin\" is equivalent to U.S. term \"cotter\".

The Marmara Sea located in modern-day Turkey is surrounded by land all around, except where it connects the two Turkish Straits, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD, would describe the Vistula as the border between Germania and Sarmatia. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal.

They may be complicated by other facial fractures or a septal hematoma. The wet nose of dogs is useful for the perception of direction. There are several recreational activities one can participate in while barefoot. Those involved in water sports such as swimming and water polo almost always participate barefoot due to the difficulty of swimming with footwear. Wrestling can be done barefoot. Although most modern Greco-Roman and WWE wrestlers wear shoes, sumo wrestling, Yağlı güreş (oil or \"Turkish\" wrestling), and mud wrestling are commonly done while barefoot. American football is not traditionally a barefoot sport, though several placekickers have preferred to kick barefoot, including Tony Franklin of the Philadelphia Eagles and Rich Karlis of the Denver Broncos. The two schools of thought involved in barefoot placekicking were that the lack of a shoe provided the kicker with a better \"feel\" for the ball and greater control over its trajectory. A nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system.

Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the air passages through the nose become temporarily propped open.

The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\n Charles E. Cawley was appointed Chief Engineer, who instructed his recently appointed assistant Frederick Banister to set out the first few miles. The proposed route through the Irwell Valley was then approved by Chief Inspector of Railways Major General Sir Charles W. Pasley on 23 September 1846. The railway began from a junction with the Manchester and Bolton Railway, in Clifton. Construction was completed quickly; William Harrison wrote \"The railway was speedily completed and was opened for traffic on 28th September 1846\", however men were asked to work on Sunday, and several were charged with breaking Sabbath. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. The station also provided a service from 2 July 1905 to Dingle in south Liverpool (and all intermediate stations running parallel with the Liverpool dock system) via Liverpool on the Liverpool Overhead Railway until 30 December 1956, when the LOR was closed and later demolished.\n\nQuestion: The age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of the Liverpool-Manchester line?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is believed the film disappeared soon after its initial release because it was so heavily edited, little of interest to audiences remained. Producer Albertini, also a well-known Italian actor in his day, played the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein in this version. The National Theatre's production of Frankenstein returned to cinema screens worldwide for a limited season in June, July and December 2012, as well as for encore screenings in October and November 2013.

Once crossed, the soul would be judged by Aeacus, Rhadamanthus and King Minos. The soul would be \n\n similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as Pluto. In the ancient Greek myth about the Labours of Heracles, the hero Heracles had to travel to the underworld to capture Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks. This yomi very closely resembles the Greek Hades; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even Elysium-like descriptions such as in the legend of Okuninushi and Susanoo. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called kegare. However, death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as otherworld. Hippolytus of Rome pictures the underworld (Hades) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the bosom of Abraham their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the \"lake of unquenchable fire\" into which they are destined to be cast.

In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized. An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, \n\n A 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for routing. ZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / store locator software on many websites, especially brick-and-click websites. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\".\n\nQuestion: In which decade were ZIP codes introduced in the USA?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: \"Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes \n\n A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. These shapes are not limited by the fox's own age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person.
