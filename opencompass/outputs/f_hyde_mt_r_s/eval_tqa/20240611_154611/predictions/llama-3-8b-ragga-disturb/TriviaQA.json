JWPC submitted a plan based on the use of nuclear weapons. On the assumption that between 100 and 200 nuclear weapons would be available, it called for 34 atomic bombs to be dropped on 24 Soviet cities; seven would be dropped on Moscow, three on Leningrad and two each on Kharkov and Stalingrad. It was reckoned that this would do massive damage to the Soviet Union's industries, and would kill or injure about one million of its citizens. The damage might well cause the Soviet Union to sue for peace. The assumption that a hundred atomic bombs were available was not correct.

He sparked debate by demolishing many of the city's vast public housing projects, which had deteriorated and were holding too many poor and dysfunctional families.

The tournament was held from Monday 20 June until Saturday 2 July 1927. In the late 1850s, bat and ball games had started to become highly known and the sport of baseball was starting to become an establishment at U.S. universities. The first intercollegiate baseball game took place in 1859 between Amherst College and Williams College.

The bridge stands 150 feet above the Nanaimo River; over 260,000 people have jumped since the site opened in 1990. Besides bungee jumping, WildPlay parks are made up of treetop activities involving high-ropes and obstacle climbing, swinging, and ziplining. In 1990, a permanent platform for bungee jumping was established by A. J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. The first parachute tower in the United States was a 115 ft tower in Ocean County, New Jersey, built by Stanley Switlik and first used by Amelia Earhart on 2 June 1935. The 262 feet Parachute Jump ride at the 1939 New York World's Fair (later moved to Coney Island) was a parachute tower, though the United States Army parachute training centre at Fort Benning had only 34 feet towers until 1941. Major William Lee of the United States Army, in charge of the training of the first 48-man platoon of US paratroopers, saw the Parachute Jump ride and constructed a similar tower at Fort Benning. While they initially offered traditional bungee jumping from a crane, their focus was to develop an idea Kitchen had for a safer alternative to bungee jumping that could be easily installed in amusement parks.

The bridge stands 150 feet above the Nanaimo River; over 260,000 people have jumped since the site opened in 1990. Besides bungee jumping, WildPlay parks are made up of treetop activities involving high-ropes and obstacle climbing, swinging, and ziplining. In 1990, a permanent platform for bungee jumping was established by A. J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. The first parachute tower in the United States was a 115 ft tower in Ocean County, New Jersey, built by Stanley Switlik and first used by Amelia Earhart on 2 June 1935. The 262 feet Parachute Jump ride at the 1939 New York World's Fair (later moved to Coney Island) was a parachute tower, though the United States Army parachute training centre at Fort Benning had only 34 feet towers until 1941. Major William Lee of the United States Army, in charge of the training of the first 48-man platoon of US paratroopers, saw the Parachute Jump ride and constructed a similar tower at Fort Benning. While they initially offered traditional bungee jumping from a crane, their focus was to develop an idea Kitchen had for a safer alternative to bungee jumping that could be easily installed in amusement parks. The bridge is mainly used for commercial purposes by the AJ Hackett Bungy Company for bungy jumping - the world's first commercial bungy jumping site.\n\n"

According to Joe DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer, the iconic younger brother \"didn't deal with Vince at all\", never maintaining any meaningful relationship with him. But earlier in his career, DiMaggio had also joked that \"If I could hit like Joe and he could talk like me, we'd make a helluva guy.\" DiMaggio once said of brother Joe: \"Joe was one heckuva player. But if our brother Cooper had not gotten hurt, he would be considered the greatest ballplayer who ever lived\". DiMaggio enjoyed a close friendship with teammates Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Johnny Pesky, which was chronicled in David Halberstam's book The Teammates.

This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the chance to enforce its vision. One of the most successful exporters was Édouard Empain, nicknamed the \"Tramway King\", whose company ran infrastructure projects across Europe, Asia and South America. The construction of an elevated line like the Stadtbahn was ruled out because of extensive building along the route, and a tunnel would have been highly problematic in the steam age. In 1911, within the framework of a much broader competition for proposals for the further development of the city of Berlin, several proposals for such a north-south railway interconnection were set forth. The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle).

Its central ridge forms the western and eastern borders, respectively, of the two counties through much of their contact. The range is about 55 miles (88 km) long from north to south and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. The highest point is McKnight Mountain. The Black Range lies almost entirely within the Gila National Forest. The Mimbres River originates from the mountain snow pack and run-off. Access to the range is primarily via New Mexico \n\n The Black River Escarpment is a geological feature in Southeastern Ontario. The river descends approximately 304 m over its 7 km course.\n\n"

The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. In the 21st century, after 58 years of non-religious use, the cathedral is once again the setting for regular liturgical celebrations in multiple languages—Russian, Polish, Korean, English, French, Spanish, Armenian and Latin—as well as benefit concerts featuring organ and church music. The cathedral is listed as a heritage building in the Russian Federation, and is a protected monument. The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a cruciform pseudo-basilica with three naves and an apse. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911.

        "context": "Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of three Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. In the 21st century, after 58 years of non-religious use, the cathedral is once again the setting for regular liturgical celebrations in multiple languages—Russian, Polish, Korean, English, French, Spanish, Armenian and Latin—as well as benefit concerts featuring organ and church music. The cathedral is listed as a heritage building in the Russian Federation, and is a protected monument. The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a cruciform pseudo-basilica with three naves and an apse. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. The main liturgical language for Masses is Russian, but services are also held\n\n"

Normally glass consists of 70% to 74% silica, 16% to 22% alkali and 5% to 10% of flux.

Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. In land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy. One of the requirements for productive farmland is adequate PAR, so PAR is used \n\n Green leaf volatiles (GLV) are volatile organic compounds that are released when plants suffer tissue damage. Some of these chemicals act as signaling compounds between either plants of the same species, of other species, or even vastly different lifeforms like insects. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide.\n\nQuestion: What is the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Chlorophyll, the most abundant plant pigment, is most efficient in capturing red and blue light. Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. In land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy. One of the requirements for productive farmland is adequate PAR, so PAR is used \n\n Green leaf volatiles (GLV) are volatile organic compounds that are released when plants suffer tissue damage. Some of these chemicals act as signaling compounds between either plants of the same species, of other species, or even vastly different lifeforms like insects. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide.\n\n"

The other two valves are at the entrance to the arteries leaving the heart these are the semilunar valves – the aortic valve at the aorta, and the pulmonary valve at the pulmonary artery. The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system.\n\n"

In common with the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies and other British territories, the official national anthem of Gibraltar is God Save the Queen. The anthem is sung every 10 September by the general public at the annual release of red and white ticker paper on Gibraltar National Day. In Wales, \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\" is sometimes accompanied by the hymn, \"Guide Me, O thou Great Redeemer\" (also referred to as \"Bread of Heaven\" from repeated words in its first verse), especially at rugby matches. The United Kingdom's national anthem is \"God Save the Queen\" but its constituent countries and Crown Dependencies also have their own national anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, each has a number of anthems which are played at occasions such as sports matches and official events.\n\n"

He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; \"to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development.\" Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. was flowing not only through the filament but also through the evacuated bulb, a phenomenon initially reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. That is, \n\n While working for the inventor Thomas Edison at Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Hammer was in charge of testing early electric light globes in 1880 through 1881. In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). Edison had chosen a carbonized (burned)\n\n"

In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai, and returned. After the 1786 war, Siam consolidated its control of Lan Na, and in 1794, took over the Laotian state of Luang Prabang, its erstwhile ally against the Burmese. In response, Burma sent in a small expedition in 1797 to Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang to check the Siamese but it failed to make any impression.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. In Catesby's view, however, James had reneged on his promises, and he had quickly lost patience with the new Stuart Dynasty. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House of Lords \n\n Guy Fawkes is a 1923 British silent historical film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Matheson Lang, Nina Vanna and Hugh Buckler. The film depicts the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 in which a group of plotters planned to blow up the Houses of Parliament.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. In Catesby's view, however, James had reneged on his promises, and he had quickly lost patience with the new Stuart Dynasty. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House of Lords \n\n Guy Fawkes is a 1923 British silent historical film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Matheson Lang, Nina Vanna and Hugh Buckler. The film depicts the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 in which a group of plotters planned to blow up the Houses of Parliament. It was based on the 1840 novel Guy Fawkes by Harrison Ainsworth.\n\n"

From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. A shorter ribbon of the same style is on the bottom of the flag, this time with the word \"TEXAS\". The emblem is centered on a blue field, which represents sincerity. In terms of measurements, the total flag's proportions are 3 by 5. The emblem measures 26 inches horizontally and 24 inches vertically. Modified versions are worn on the officers' evening dress uniforms, with the scarlet flanked with gold trim, and on members of the Marine Band, which wear the traditional red stripe with a white stripe in the center. The flag is dominated by a green, elongated and rigid letter \"E\" upon a white background. The current flag consists of a yellow vertical strip on the left side where three red horns are depicted above each other.\n\n"

Regarded by Parisians as an archetypal \"wild Australian\", Russell had an \"independence of spirit\" that, Joanna Mendelssohn speculates, helped shape his and Van Gogh's friendship. van der Vinne''' (1736, Haarlem &ndash; 1811, Haarlem), was a Dutch 18th century painter and the great-grandson of Vincent van der Vinne. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a Dutch realist painter and leading member of the Hague School, who had a significant early impact on Vincent van Gogh.\n\n"

Males reach maturity and are fertile around 6-8 years. This is the longest maturation period of any of the apes. During this period, the offspring learns the intricate task of weaving a sleeping platform.\n\n"
