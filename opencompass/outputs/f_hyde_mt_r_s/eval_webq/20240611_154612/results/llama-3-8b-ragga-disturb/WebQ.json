Situational code-switching, style shifting and code-alternation occur continuously, seamlessly in communication between all Jamaicans of all classes and in all situations, in all speech acts. Recently, Jamaican patois has gone through a process of decreolization, similar to that which happened with AAVE due to the basilect creole variety developing \n\n the acrolect English. It is important to note that for all practical purposes, English is Jamaica's native language. When the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century Jamaica was linguistically a blank slate. Jamaican patois \n\n is a mixture of English and an adaptation that English took in the new environment of the Caribbean when it became mixed with the other imported languages. It is here that nation language becomes of use to the Caribbean poet: \"It is \n\n into being when the island's burgeoning sugar industry created a large demand for field labour. The incoming African slave labourers—who spoke many various languages themselves—and the English speaking plantocracy communicated through the formation of a contact creole language unique to Jamaica. Today we know this creole as patois, and even those Jamaicans who don't speak it on a daily basis can speak it fluently, and fully understand it. Standard English is taught in Jamaican schools, although teachers may speak to pupils and their parents in patois outside of the classroom.\n\nQuestion: what does jamaican people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was also the governor of Tennessee from 1839 to 1841. He was a devout follower of Jacksonian democratic values. Dr. Seigenthaler writing about him, \"To Polk, all politics was fiscal, deeply rooted in the early struggle between federalism and republicanism; Hamilton and Jefferson; the wealthy elite and the common man.\" Polk was also elected to the Kent County Levy Court in 1819. In 1826, the Federalist Party selected Polk as their candidate for governor, and after a hard-fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the Democratic-Republican candidate, David Hazzard. Polk first represented Sussex County, and served two terms in the State House in the 1814 and 1815 sessions. He served two more terms in the 1818 and 1824 \n\n Speaker.

In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: \"'I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat one beats the one in D for difficulty.'\" Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \"grand\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble. 450 is a concertante work for piano and orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The concerto is scored for solo piano, flute (third movement only), two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra. The earliest known English horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann \n\n 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The concerto is in three movements:  Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. It is known that Milling's concerti were performed in 1782 by the Italian oboist Giovanni Palestrini.\n\nQuestion: who did mozart write his four horn concertos for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west.

Shin-Fukushima Station (新福島駅) is a railway station in Fukushima-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Due to damages like these, the Fukushima plant released nuclear material into the Pacific Ocean and has continued to do so. Along the same coastline, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) found trace amounts of Fukushima contaminates 100 miles (150 km) off of the coast of Eureka, California in November 2014. In 2008, after the opening of 7 brand new nuclear reactors in Japan (3 on Honshū, and 1 each on Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Tanegashima) Japan became the third largest nuclear power user in the world with 55 nuclear reactors. 140,000 residents within 20 km of the plant were evacuated. In 2013, contaminated groundwater was found in-between some of the affected turbine buildings in the Fukushima Daiichi facility, including locations at bordering seaports that led into the Pacific Ocean. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the entity that manages and operates the facility, further investigated the contamination in areas that would deem safe to conduct operations.\n\nQuestion: where is the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1942, Sebrell received the Charles Goodyear Medal. It was applied to solid rubber tires, rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939. The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process. A US patent to Goodyear also claimed sipes improve tire traction, and tend to close completely in \n\n Games used the city as a venue.

The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. After the stunningly quick defeat in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. France surrendered on June 22, resulting in the division of France into a German-controlled zone and a partially occupied area known Vichy France. Roosevelt, who was determined to stay out of the war even if Britain is defeated, considered the shift of public opinion; the fall of Paris led to a rise in isolationist sentiment as observed by \n\n  On 8 May 1945, the World War II Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of Nazi Germany and the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.

The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France, and ratified on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nQuestion: who did france surrender to in ww2?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Though Quayle had compiled an unremarkable record in Congress, he was popular among many conservatives, and the campaign hoped that Quayle's youth would appeal to younger voters. While Bush won a swift victory in the Republican primaries, many in the press referred to the Democratic presidential candidates as the \"Seven Dwarfs\" due to a lack of notable party leaders in the field.

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996. The \"sharp s\" (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie (Peter Lang, 2006). Until 1918, the spoken standard in Austria was the Schönbrunner Deutsch, a sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg family and the nobility of Austria-Hungary. The dialect was similar to Viennese German and other eastern dialects of German spoken in Austria, but was slightly nasalized. In fact, in cities such as Hanover and Berlin, the dialect started disappearing with the exception of a small minority of Low German speakers that only make up 5 million people.\n\nQuestion: which countries speak german officially?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed in the last quarter of 1991. Both the Revolutions of 1989 in the Eastern Bloc \n\n remained of the Soviet government, including the Kremlin. The final round of the Soviet Union's collapse began on December 1, 1991. Furthermore, the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet Union's federative system—that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples – eased the task of secession and independence. On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\". An opinion piece by Gorbachev written in April 2006 stated: \"The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" The collapse of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise.

On request from Yamaha, Group Finot in France designed the boat in 1973. The Yamaha team with Mr Horinshi was very impressed with the design, and two prototypes were made in 1975. Wickström led the company until the end of his life, and he was an appreciated manager. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time. Engines are installed either inboard or outboard. Inboard engines are part of the boat construction, while outboard engines are secured to the transom and hang off the back of the boat. Motorboat engines run on gasoline or diesel fuel. Motorboats are commonly used for recreation, sport, or racing. The categories include inboard, inboard endurance, professional outboard, stock outboard, unlimited outboard performance craft, drag, modified outboard, and offshore.

The Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren believed that the dictionary recorded a speech standard of the capital Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties. The Chinese script emerged from proto-writing in the Chinese Bronze Age, during about the 14th to 11th centuries BC (Oracle bone script), while symbol systems native to Europe and India are extinct and replaced by descendants of the Semitic abjad during the Iron Age. The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script yet discovered is the body of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze from the late Shang dynasty. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. Most archaeologists consider these not directly linked to the earliest true writing.

In the book, he recounts Barack Obama's upbringing and early political career in Chicago and argues that Obama is an \"extreme leftis[t]\" who should not be elected president. The book claims to document \"Obama's extensive connections with Islam and radical politics\", his \"religious affiliation with ... black-liberation theology\", and his associations with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, fundraiser Tony Rezko, and radical activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, formerly of the Weather Underground. The book opens with a quote by Andy Martin, who The Nation, The Washington Post, and The New York Times have identified as the primary source for the allegations that Obama is concealing an alleged Muslim faith, rumors which began shortly after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Having attended Wright's sermon, Obama later adapted Wright's phrase \"audacity to hope\" to \"audacity of hope\" which became the title for his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and the title of his second book. While a Senate candidate, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, entitled The Audacity of Hope that propelled him to national prominence. Years later, in his memoir A Promised Land, Obama wrote that according to the White House's polling, the incident caused a larger drop in white support for his presidency than any other single event. In 2006, Obama released The Audacity of Hope, a book-length account that expanded upon many of the same themes he originally addressed in the convention speech.

The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK in the mid-late 1970s identified the need for defining higher-level protocols. The UK National Computing Centre publication 'Why Distributed Computing', which was based on extensive research into future potential configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. Hubert Zimmermann, and Charles Bachman as chairman, played a key role in the development of the Open Systems Interconnections reference model. The drafters of the reference model had to contend with many competing priorities and interests. Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December as a monolithic (single layer) design. The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London, but it was not installed \n\n SATNET in 1982 and on the ARPANET in January 1983 after the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. This resulted in a networking model that became known informally as TCP/IP. Computer manufacturers developed proprietary protocol suites such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options.

McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign, Also in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his Valley Campaign. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040 km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those \n\n the Shenandoah Valley came under local leadership until the Department of Northern Virginia. It was created on October 22, 1861, as Johnston prepared defenses in Northern Virginia. The Valley District was defined as the area between the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Alleghenies and extended south from the Potomac River to the vicinity of Staunton, Virginia and covered an area of roughly five thousand square miles. A total of 54,000 men from both sides participated in this Union victory on September 19. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek.

In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\". Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next \n\n  In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s. Einstein was still undecided on his future. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.

While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. He is said to have failed to patent his sewing machine at all because he feared it would create unemployment among seamstresses.

Of the Latin American countries, Cuba was most affected by the immigration of Canary Islanders, and their presence influenced the development of the Cuban dialect and accent. Many words in traditional Cuban Spanish can be traced to the dialect spoken in the Canary Islands. Cuban Spanish is very close to Canarian Spanish, as Canarians have been emigrating to Cuba since the 16th century, especially during the 19th and (early) 20th centuries.

In his inaugural address, Bush said: \"I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. Having served in various government positions, particularly the position of Director of the CIA, Bush sought the presidential nomination in the 1980 Republican primaries. He was defeated by Ronald Reagan, a conservative former governor from California. Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the South. Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely. Many pundits believed that Democrats were unlikely even to improve on Dukakis's 1988 showing. However, Bush's tax increase had angered many conservatives, and he faced a challenge from the right in the 1992 Republican primaries. Bush fended off \n\n George H. W.

He proceeded to conduct the first experiments in this area. In 1912, at the Curie Institute, he was given responsibility for the Pasteur Laboratory, with the mission to study the biological and medical effects of radioactivity. The Curie laboratory, in contrast, dealt with research in the fields of physics and chemistry. Müller confirmed this in his Eyewitness Auschwitz (1979). Auschwitz scholar Robert Jan van Pelt wrote in 2002 that the description contains errors, but that given the circumstances, including the men's lack of architectural training, \"one would become suspicious if it did not contain errors\". He stayed with Handley-Page for the remainder of his career, eventually becoming head of research, until 5 months before his death at Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, in 1966. The center derives its name from the pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who was a professor in Würzburg from 1849 to 1856 and was the first to postulate that diseases originated in dysfunctions of cells.

George Mason opposed the Constitution for its lack of personal guarantees, James Madison argued liberties were inherently guarded in the Constitution. Following the state Ratification Conventions, Madison began to draft the original Bill of Rights in the First Congress from 200 state proposals. In its final form, the Origination Clause was a major selling point for the ratification of the Constitution. James Madison, who supported the final version during and after the 1787 Convention, wrote the following in Federalist 58 while the debate over ratification raged: \"The house of representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government.

An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as Flemish), and French is spoken by 40%. In 1846, 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. Constitutionally, it is a politically distinct Region, while within its boundaries both the Flemish and French Communities exercise their authority. Historically, the local language of Brussels was Dutch, and Dutch remained the vernacular language of a majority of inhabitants until around 1950. The city has strong economic ties with surrounding Flanders, and many Dutch-speakers commute to Brussels for work; but, at the same time, the expanding suburbs of Brussels led to a majority of French-speakers in six Flemish villages. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. In the 1880s, a Walloon \n\n French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking.

The same pattern which emerged with the first world war continued with the second: warring European powers, blockades, official U.S. neutrality but this time President Roosevelt tried to avoid all of Wilson's mistakes. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend-Lease.

Edgar Degas and Felix Vallotton have also been characterized as intimists. French art critic Camille Mauclair defined Intimism as: \"a revelation of the soul through the things painted, the magnetic suggestion of what lies behind them through the description of the outer appearance, the intimate meaning of the spectacles of life\" While the movement is often associated with Impressionism, the Intimists diverged from the Impressionists in abandoning a focus on formal accuracy in depiction of light, color, and perspective in favor of emphasized texture, exaggerated palette, and merged figure and ground. Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence. Giacometti was a key player in the Surrealist art movement, but his work resists easy categorization. Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject. He once said that \n\n  The art movement known as Cubism appeared in France between 1907 and 1912, influencing the development of Art Deco. In 1912, the artists of the Section d'Or exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Archaeological evidence shows that Iroquois ancestors lived in the Finger Lakes and surrounding regions from at least 1000 CE. Members of the Iroquois Confederacy (Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Mohawk) speak Iroquoian languages that are distinctly different from those of other Iroquoian speakers. they began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. Their lands were surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking tribes, all traditional enemies, including the Shawnee to the west in the Ohio Country, the Neutral Nation and Huron confederacies on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, and the Susquehannock to their south. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy. By virtue of their location, the tribes wielded considerable influence in European–Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards. The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River.

Previously, Hagar collaborated with Washburn Guitars, which made a Hagar signature guitar named Washburn RR150, which featured Seymour Duncan pickups and a piezo pickup incorporated into the bridge. In recent years, Hagar has switched to Gibson Guitars, having two signatures by them: the \"Red Rocker\" Les Paul, and the Sammy Hagar Explorer.\n\nQuestion: what kind of guitar did george harrison use?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It includes the six states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, with its largest city and cultural capital Boston, founded in 1630. Sometimes the area was called \"Greater New England\", because of the influence of its culture as migrants moved west across the continent. Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the Wampanoag, Massachusett, Nipmuc, Pennacook, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Quinnipiac. The Mohegan, Pequot, Pocumtuc, Podunk, Tunxis, and Narragansett were based in southern New England. The Mahican were located in western New England in the upper Hudson River Valley (around what was developed by Europeans as Albany, New York). With the exception of a few remote areas of New Hampshire and Vermont and about half of Maine, all of New England lies within the borders of an incorporated municipality. New England has counties, though in southern New England, they are strictly used as dividing lines for judicial systems and statistical purposes, while in northern New England, they often handle other limited functions, such as law enforcement, education and some public facilities in addition to judicial systems. New England also has cities, most of which are towns whose residents have voted to replace the town meeting form of government with a city form.\n\nQuestion: what places make up new england?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented \"co-presidency\", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary).

As Rutherford achieved fame in both Physics and Chemistry, it was felt that he was a particularly appropriate namesake given the university's original desire to break down the boundaries between disciplines. Rutherford was also an alumnus of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a Metcalfe high school. After graduating in 1874, he attended the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist college in Woodstock.

Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. Central Colorado is home to most of the population of the state and its geography is dominated by the Rocky Mountains, their foothills, mesas, and canyons, the rivers that run through them, and the open plains off the foothills. It flows west to east starting in Colorado and dumping into the Mississippi River. Its length of 1,469 miles allows it to flow through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. This is a list of drainage basins in the U.S. State of Colorado. East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way.

Criticism has been levelled against the competence of its leaders,  perceived corruption,  and its foreign policy. facto nonpartisan systems are mostly situated in states and regions with small populations, such as in Micronesia, Tuvalu, and Palau, where organizing political parties is seen as unnecessary or impractical. De jure nonpartisan national governments sometimes resemble one-party states, but governments of the latter type explicitly recognize a single political party that all officials are required to be a member of. Unless there are legal restrictions on political parties, factions within nonpartisan governments may evolve into political parties.

Morris was born in Rice County, Kansas. He received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in political science from Washburn University in 1943. Morris received a Doctor of Juridical Science from the same institution in 1955. In 1942, while a student at Washburn, Morris was initiated into the Kansas Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta. Morris was admitted to practice law in Kansas in 1947, in Oklahoma in 1949 and in Texas in 1978. Morris and his late wife, Deane Conklin Morris, had three children. A 6 ft forward from the University of Maryland, College Park, Morris was hailed as one of the best prospects in all of college basketball after his sophomore season in 1998–99. But while the consensus was that he would have been a Top-5 pick in the 1999 NBA draft had he left school after that year along with teammate Steve Francis, Morris instead opted to return to Maryland for his junior and senior seasons, and his draft stock dropped after two less individually successful campaigns. Morris helped play Maryland to the first Final Four in school history during the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament to cap his senior season. Born on June 30, 1853, in Lynchburg, Campbell County, Virginia, Morris attended a private school. He was a Professor of Mathematics for Texas Military Institute (now TMI Episcopal) from 1873 to 1876. He was a Professor of Applied Mathematics for Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Texas A&M University) from 1876 to 1879.\n\nQuestion: where did william morris go to college?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some Seneca also live with other Iroquois peoples on the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario. The Seneca Nation has three reservations, two of which are occupied: Cattaraugus Reservation, Allegany Indian Reservation, and the mostly unpopulated Oil Springs Reservation. It has two alternating capitals on the two occupied reservations: Irving at Cattaraugus Reservation, and Jimerson Town near Salamanca on the Allegany Reservation. In the Seneca language the people are known as O-non-dowa-gah, (pronounced: Oh-n'own-dough-wahgah) or \"Great Hill People.\" The historical Seneca occupied territory throughout the Finger Lakes area in Central New York, and in the Genesee Valley \n\n The government of this tribe was established in 1848 by a Constitutional Convention of Seneca Indians residing on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Territories in present-day New York. The Seneca Nation of Indians Constitution established a tri-partite governing structure based on general elections of 16 Councilors, three Executives (President, Treasurer, Clerk), and Court justices (Surrogates and Peacemakers). The famous Great Indian Warpath, known locally as the \"Seneca Trail\", followed the Potomac River, allowing the Algonquian, Tuscarora, and Seneca nations to transit the area for purposes of trade and war. Excavation for the building of the present Seneca Rocks Visitor Center uncovered evidence of two villages, the more recent of which thrived about 700 years ago. In the 21st century, the Seneca Nation of Indians in New York has a total enrolled population of nearly 8,000 citizens.

Grant. He was also the founder of the Taft political dynasty, and father of President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Taft was appointed as minister to Austria-Hungary by Chester A. Arthur in 1882. Taft had a reputation for serving political office with integrity and character. While studying law Taft held a tutorship at Yale. Taft did not want to practice law in New York because he believed people were under the corrupting influence of wealth. In 1839 Taft migrated to Cincinnati where he was a member of the Cincinnati City Council, and became one of the most influential citizens of Ohio. After law school, Taft joined the Cincinnati law firm, Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, which had been founded by his father. By 1913, the school had outgrown the hotel, and Mr. Taft commissioned the first permanent campus building, a collegiate gothic castle known as HDT, after Horace Dutton Taft and designed by architect Bertram Goodhue, with landscape architecture by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. The second major structure, completed in 1931, was designed by James Gamble Rogers and was named CPT after Horace Taft's brother Charles Phelps Taft, who was a major contributor to the Taft School. Taft was a member of the Taft family political dynasty. His son, William Howard Taft, was the 27th president of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States, and was a member of Yale's Skull and Bones like his founder father; another son, Charles Phelps Taft, supported the founding of Wolf's Head Society at Yale; both his grandson and great-grandson, Robert A.

Chaplin was elevated to Officier in 1881. Chaplin's artistic talent was admired by renowned writers, painters and critics such as Arsène Houssaye, Émile Zola and Théophile Gautier. Édouard Manet felt Chaplin knew \"the smile of a woman\". His works can be viewed in the French museums of Bordeaux, Bayonne, Bourges, Mulhouse, Paris, Reims, Rouen, Saintes (Charente-Maritime), and the Louvre Museum Graphic Art Database. Chaplin was among Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie's favourite court artists. In 1859, when his portrait of Aurora was banned by the judges of the Salon as \"too erotically suggestive\", Napoléon III defended Chaplin and overturned the disqualification order. His sensual portraits of women and young girls, often with models posed erotically in hazy surroundings and frequently wearing transparent clothing, attracted the interest of the high society and aristocracy of Paris during the French Third Republic (1870&ndash;1940) guaranteeing his success and wealth. Chaplin painted many works in his early days, including floral studies that were displayed at the Salon de las Flores. He used to engrave the works of the Dutch artist Pieter Paul Rubens and gained further influence from his work. As a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, Chaplin exhibited his paintings at the Paris Salon, the official exhibition venue of members' work.\n\nQuestion: what is charlie chaplin famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By the time he married Deborah Hitchborn, a member of a long-standing Boston family that owned a small shipping wharf, in 1729, Rivoire had anglicized his name to Paul Revere. Their son, Paul Revere, was the third of 12 children and eventually the eldest surviving son. Revere grew up in the environment \n\n On December 12, 1774, in Burlington, he was married by a civil magistrate to Elizabeth Fenimore, daughter of Richard Fenimore, a Quaker of Rancocas. Revere relented and returned to his father's church, although he did become friends with Mayhew, and returned to the West Church in the late 1760s. Revere's father died in 1754, when Paul was legally too young to officially be the master of the family silver shop. On August 4, 1757, he married Sarah Orne (1736–1773); their first child was born eight months later. Sarah died in 1773, and on October 10 of that year, Revere married Rachel Walker (1745–1813).

In later years, Durston attempted to develop a modernized remake of I Drink Your Blood, but the project was cancelled after his death. young Durst learned the mercantile trade and became fluent in several languages, including those of Indian tribes among whom the House of Barr and Davenport maintained resident traders. Davenport fled with 16-year-old Durst to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Afterward, Durst returned to Natchitoches. Durst currently resides in Stony Brook, New York. Landmarks from Central Massachusetts, where Durst grew up, feature in both novels; these include the Higgins Armory and Bancroft Tower. In Durst's version, the protagonist is an aspiring arctic researcher in Alaska who encounters and marries a polar bear munaqsri, or transporter of souls. With Ice, Durst became a finalist for an Andre Norton Award for a second time. In 1835, Durst became a legislative representative of Coahuila y Tejas from Nacogdoches.

Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles. It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting. Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. In \n\n This ancient breed originated in Valencia, Spain. The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu (an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high).

At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s. Einstein was still undecided on his future. At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case. In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\".

The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking bourgeoisie who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the Flemish movement, which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the Flemish people. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921.

The majority of Belgian Turks descend from the Republic of Turkey; however, there has also been significant Turkish migration from other post-Ottoman countries including ethnic Turkish communities which have come to Belgium from the Balkans (especially from Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Romania), the island of Cyprus, and more recently Iraq and Syria. From the 4th to the 6th century AD, the Great Migration took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the Franks, the Frisians and Saxons.\n\nQuestion: where did flemish people come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1898, when New York City was consolidated into its present form, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and unified, centralized city government (the New York City government). Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature. Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution, and a local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions).

It is the world’s first federal democratic republic founded on the consent of the governed. facto nonpartisan systems are mostly situated in states and regions with small populations, such as in Micronesia, Tuvalu, and Palau, where organizing political parties is seen as unnecessary or impractical. De jure nonpartisan national governments sometimes resemble one-party states, but governments of the latter type explicitly recognize a single political party that all officials are required to be a member of. Unless there are legal restrictions on political parties, factions within nonpartisan governments may evolve into political parties. The United States of America initially did not have enfranchised political parties, but these evolved soon after independence. The most basic features of republicanism anywhere are a representational government in which citizens elect leaders from among themselves for a predefined term, as opposed to a permanent ruling class or aristocracy, and laws are passed by these leaders for the benefit of the entire republic. In addition, unlike a direct or \"pure\" democracy in which the majority vote rules, a republic codifies in a charter or constitution a certain set of basic civil rights that is guaranteed to every citizen and cannot be overridden by majority rule. The American interpretation of \"republicanism\" was inspired by the Whig party in Great Britain which openly criticized \n\n Representative democracy, also known as indirect democracy, is a type of democracy where elected persons represent a group of people, in contrast to direct democracy.

According to tradition, Silwan originated at the time of Saladin in the twelfth century on Ras al-Amud, on the south-west slope  of  the  Mount of Olives,  then in the early twentieth  century, expanding  across  the  Kidron Valley (known to locals as Wadi Sitti Maryam or the Valley of St.Mary) eventually incorporating all of  the Southeast Hill. David (c. 1003–970 BCE) – made Jerusalem the capital of Israel. He claims the location and north-south orientation of the fortifications make them part of the defensive walls of what is known today as the City of David and  described by Josephus as the Lower City. But in Greek any fortification is called an acra, this is a common noun, not a proper one, thus some confusion as to which fortification each specific ancient description is referring to: the refortified City of David, which Ritmeyer identifies as Josephus' southern part of the Lower City, or the Acra proper, the entirely new fortress. In 1997, management of the City of David within the park was assumed by the Ir David Foundation (commonly known as Elad). First suggested in 1920 for this particular area, the term \"City of David\" was used officially from the 1970s onward, following the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel, but today the name with its biblical and political connotations is questioned by some in the archaeological academic community. Since El'Ad took over the management of the park in 1997, 'David's City' has essentially become a religious-nationalist battle cry that has transformed the area from an ordinary Palestinian neighbourhood with a few excavation pits, largely unknown to the Israeli public, into a religious settlement and major national biblical\n\nQuestion: where was the city of david?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject \n\n poet Dante called him “the master of those who know\".

Australia used pounds, shillings and pence until 1966, when it adopted the decimal system with the Australian dollar divided into 100 cents. The Australian sixpence circulated from 1910 up until the decimalisation of Australian Currency in 1966. The coins were initially minted in England; however, Australia began to mint their own from the year of 1916 at branches of the Royal Mint in Sydney and Melbourne. The coins which made up Australia's pre-decimal currency were identical to British currency in the characteristics of weight and size. Unique Australian currency was created with decimalisation in 1966. At the time of the sixpence, Australian lives were 'very English'. British coins continued in use until 1910, when Australian silver coins were introduced. The Australian dollar replaced the Australian pound on 14 February 1966 as part of the decimalisation process. In the late 1950s the Decimal Currency committee guided that the Australian government begin to consider to replacement of imperial systems with decimal currency. The introduction of a decimal currency would simplify calculations, and increase financial efficiency, eventuating in a positive economic outcome for Australia. The decimalisation of Australia's currency advanced Australia's economic independence and promoted Australian symbols.\n\nQuestion: what does australia use for currency?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Though the Emperor of Japan is supposed to be the direct descendant of Amaterasu Ōmikami, the Shinto sun goddess, all Imperial family members, as well as almost all Japanese, were Buddhists who also practiced Shinto religious rites as well. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan tried to reform its state to resemble a European constitutional monarchy. The Emperor, Buddhism, and Shintoism were officially separated and Shintoism was set as the state religion. The Constitution specifically stated that Emperor is \"holy and inviolable\" (天皇は神聖にして侵すべからず). Some of its powers are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the binding \"advice and approval\" of the Cabinet. Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler. This ancient rite was held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan, until 1990 when the enthronement ceremony for Emperor Akihito took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

Approximately 75 miles (120 km) long, it is the name given to the distinctive eastern edge of the San Rafael Swell. By the end of the century, Spain had issued two grazing concessions north of the pueblo that included the southeastern corner of the Valley, Rancho San Rafael and Rancho Portesuelo. Francisco Reyes, alcalde or mayor of Los Angeles from 1793–1795, had set up a grazing operation which he called Rancho Encino located in what is now Mission Hills near the village of Pasakngna. Reyes's property had a substantial water supply from artesian wells and limestone for building, and was situated a day's walk from the existing missions San Gabriel and San Buenaventura. By 1817, Mission San Rafael was established and padres began journeying to Point Reyes, intent on enticing the Coast Miwok to the mission.

Located directly across the street from the Virginia State Capitol, it has long been a popular house of worship for political figures, including General Robert E. Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis (earning it the nickname \"the Cathedral of the Confederacy\"). St. Paul's was built in 1845 as a branch of the Monumental Church, which had outgrown its building. The Cathedral Church of St. Paul is an Episcopal cathedral located in Burlington, Vermont, United States. Paul presided over the 50-day trial of the Franklin County moonshine conspiracy, said to be the longest trial in Virginia history to that time. To Paul and his colleagues fell the task of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in desegregation lawsuits in the Western District of Virginia. In August 1956, Paul issued a historic ruling ordering the desegregation of the Charlottesville public schools, and which soon set off Massive Resistance as by-now-United States Senator Harry F. Byrd vehemently disagreed with the United States Supreme Court ruling, and state officials obstructed its implementation. Paul also sat on the 3-judge panel that ordered the integration of the graduate schools of the University of Virginia in the Gregory Swanson case.

It is generally held that the Latins, one of many ancient Italic tribes, adopted the western variant of the Greek alphabet in the 7th century BCE from Cumae, a Greek colony in southern Italy – making the early Latin alphabet one among several Old Italic scripts emerging at the time. The early Latin script was heavily influenced by the then regionally dominant Etruscan civilization; the Latins ultimately adopted 22 of the original 26 Etruscan letters, which derived from Western Greek as well. It is highly probable that the Latins received their alphabet via the Etruscans rather than directly from the Greek colonists. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from Latinus. Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system first spread over the Italian Peninsula with the rise of the Roman Republic from the 4th to the 1st century BCE. During the early and high Middle Ages, the script was spread by Christian missionaries and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems in Central and Northern Europe, and the remainder of the British Isles,. In the Age of Discovery, the first wave of European colonisation saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the Americas and Australia, whereas \n\n The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium. As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture, during the Roman Empire, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic Latin-speaking people and the Latin-speaking people of Italia, Gaul, Hispania and Dacia whose land was settled by Roman colonists.\n\nQuestion: where did the latin language originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory. Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven. These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds objectionable. Judaism teaches something similar – hell is an intense experience of cleansing, more an expression of kindness than a punishment. Fourth-century Christian theologian and Bishop Diodorus of Tarsus wrote: \"For the wicked there are punishments, not perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a disadvantage, but they are to be purified for a brief period according to\n\nQuestion: what do christians believe about heaven hell and purgatory?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His methods were to complete the control of Ireland, and to forge an alliance with Scotland. In 1587, Cecil persuaded the Queen to order the execution of the Roman Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, after she was implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth. Both Culpeper and Dereham were found guilty and sentenced to death. Dereham received no such mercy. Culpeper was executed along with Dereham at Tyburn on 10 December 1541, and their heads were put on display on London Bridge. Culpeper was buried at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate church in London. Queen Catherine Howard and Lady Rochford were both executed on 13 February 1542, and were buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower of London. Somerville publicly exclaimed his desire and intention to assassinate Elizabeth I of England. Nevertheless, the deeply suspicious Elizabethan security services took him seriously; perhaps as a precaution or to make an example, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and tortured.

Even within the narrower field of literature, the play's influence has been strong. As Foakes writes, \"No other character's name in Shakespeare's plays, and few in literature, have come to embody an attitude to life ... and been converted into a noun in this way.\" Andrew Wise was the son of a Yorkshire yeoman; as \"Wythes,\" he served an eight-year apprenticeship under Henry Smith and Thomas Bradshaw starting in 1581, and became a \"freeman\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 26 May 1589. He ran his own business in London from about 1593 to 1603; his shop was at the sign of the Angel in St. Paul's Churchyard. He entitled it \"Shakespeare at the Funambules\", and in it he summarized and analyzed an unnamed pantomime of unusually somber events: Pierrot murders an old-clothes man for garments to court a duchess, then is skewered in turn by the sword with which he stabbed the peddler when the latter's ghost lures him into a dance at \n\n In addition to his possible authorship of the Famous Victories Evans had an indirect influence on Shakespearean drama.

The killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite Priests, but female Priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office. Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangites, though belief in their correctness is still required. Animal sacrifice has occurred in almost all cultures, from the Hebrews to the Greeks and Romans to the Yoruba. This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. In Judaism, Jews are forbidden from consuming (among other things) pork, any carnivore animals, any herbivores that are not ruminants, any ruminants that do not have split hooves, shellfish (including shrimps, lobsters and so on), fish species that don't have scales, blood of any kind, food offered to idols, or the meat of living animals or strangled animals. The Seven Laws of Noah, which Jews believe gentiles must follow, also forbid consuming the meat of living animals. The Council of Jerusalem instructed gentile Christians not to consume blood, food offered to idols, or the meat of strangled animals, since \"the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\" 1) Animal sacrifice: The ordinance of animal sacrifice was instituted in the Strangite denominations, primarily as a part of Strangite celebration rituals.\n\nQuestion: when did the jews stop making animal sacrifices?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n Australian English arose from a dialectal 'melting pot' created by the intermingling of early settlers who were from a variety of dialectal regions of Great Britain and Ireland. Australian English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. Maung (Mawung, Mawng, Gun-marung) is an Australian aboriginal language spoken by the Maung people on the Goulburn Islands, off the north coast of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia. Maung is taught in local schools alongside English and other languages such as Iwaidja or Kunwinjku. One in three of Australia's Ndebele-speakers and one in three of Australia's Shona-speakers live in Sydney. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals may be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions.

The kingdom consolidated around the Kingdom of Sardinia, with which several states voluntarily united to form the Kingdom of Italy. Others polities, such as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Papal States, were conquered and annexed. Formally, the union in each territory was sanctioned by a popular referendum where people were formally asked if they agreed to have as their new ruler Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia and his legitimate heirs. The two historical parliamentary factions, the liberal and progressive Left and the conservative and monarchist Right, formed a single liberal and centrist group, known as Liberal Union, under the leadership of Giovanni Giolitti. This phenomenon, known in Italian as Trasformismo (roughly translatable in English as \"transformism\"—in a satirical newspaper, the PM was depicted as a chameleon), effectively removed political differences in Parliament, which was dominated by an undistinguished liberal bloc with a landslide majority until after World War I. This alliance governed against two smaller opposition: The Clericals, composed by some Vatican-oriented politicians, The Extreme, formed by the socialist faction which represented a real left in a present-day concept. The party vehemently opposed the Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party. The goal of the party was the annexation of Italy to the United States.

It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Egypt's position in the heart of the Arabic speaking world has made it the centre of culture and its widespread dialect has had a huge influence on almost all neighbouring dialects, having so many Egyptian sayings in their daily lives. The Coptic language, the most recent stage of Egyptian written \n\n  Arabic is currently Egypt's official language. It came to Egypt in the 7th century, and it is the formal and official language of the state which is used by the government and newspapers.

It is located in the northwestern corner of the Precinct of Amon-Re at the Karnak complex. As Karnak became more prominent, pharaohs sought to leave their mark on the temple complex with their own monuments. Although he began construction at Karnak during his rule, the association the city had with other gods drove Akhenaten to establish a new city and capital at Amarna for the Aten. The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk. Located in Northern Syria, and built during the late Bronze Age (1300 BC until 740 BC), predating Solomon's temple. It was built in a three part style with a foundation of limestone and basalt, but the temple itself would have been mudbrick and wood. Carved into the floor between the porch and main hall are several feet, the meaning is debatable, but probably marks the deities path into the temple. The walls of the main room are engraved with lions and other artwork. At the back of the temple there is a hall full of carved stelae with pictures of religious practices and royalty of the time. It is one of the most visited monuments of Ancient Egypt. The structure was built around the 19th Egyptian Dynasty (c. 1290–1224 BC). Its design was initially instituted by Hatshepsut, at the North-west chapel to Amun in the upper terrace of Deir el-Bahri.\n\nQuestion: where was the temple of karnak built?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Japanese started locally imitating Chinese cash coins, which were known as Shichūsen (私鋳銭). Japanese cash coins were officially demonetised in 1891 after officially circulating as a division of the Japanese yen with an exchange rate of 10.000 mon for 1 yen. Cash coins were introduced to Japan in the century inspired by the Chinese Kaigen Tsūhō (開元通寳) cash coins from the Tang dynasty. Because these currencies were so similar cash coins around the Far East were interchangeable and Japanese cash coins circulated in other countries while foreign cash coins also circulated in Japan. The first Japanese cash coins were the Wadōkaichin (和同開珎) which were produced from 29 August 708.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians.

Johnson attended and graduated from San Jose State University. For the San Jose State Spartans basketball team, Johnson played 12 games as a basketball player after most team members walked off and refused to play under coach Bill Berry. Johnson's reasoning for missing practices was to help take care of his mother in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but because telephone lines were down across the area, there wasn't much of a way for Johnson to communicate to his head coach Claude Gilbert. Nevertheless, his dismissal from the Spartans football program dropped Johnson's draft stock all the way to the 169th pick in the 1990 NFL Draft by the Phoenix Cardinals. On August 6, 2019, Johnson committed to play college basketball for Tennessee over offers from Ohio State and Virginia, among others. On May 17, 2011, Johnson announced he was leaving the university. One month later, on June 17, 2011, Johnson reported that he would transfer to the University of Central Florida, where he would play for the UCF Knights football team. After redshirting in 2011 due to NCAA transfer rules, Johnson was the back-up to Latavius Murray in 2012. After two years with the Huskies, Johnson transferred to Cal State Northridge. Coach Reggie Theus said, \"Darin has a very quick step, is strong, gets to the rim quickly, is a good mid-range shooter and his style of play will fit in perfectly at CSUN.\" Johnson opted to forgo his remaining college eligibility and turned pro at the conclusion of the 2016-17 campaign, entering the 2017 NBA draft.\n\nQuestion: what college did magic johnson play for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He worked off La Mettrie's materialistic views but modified them in order to be not as extreme. La Mettrie's extreme beliefs were rejected strongly, but his work did help influence psychology, specifically behaviorism. However, the backlash he received was so strong that many behaviorists knew very little to nothing about La Mettrie and rather built off other materialists with similar arguments. He became one of the top celebrities in Paris, to the point that effigies made of chocolate, marzipan, and gingerbread were made of his \"grotesque\" figure and sold and consumed in great quantities throughout Paris.

An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg. Speer modified Werner March's design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. Speer used forced Jewish labor on these projects, in addition to regular German workers. Speer's offices undertook building work for each branch of the military, and for the SS, using slave labor. Speer's building work made him among the wealthiest of the Nazi elite. Little remains of Speer's personal architectural works, other than the plans and photographs. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, 46 ft high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures proposed as part of Welthauptstadt Germania, Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. During the war, the Speer-designed Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse.\n\nQuestion: what did albert speer design?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For Catholics, the Catholic Church is the official custodian and interpreter of the Bible. Therefore, Catholicism's teaching concerning the Sacred Scriptures and their genuine sense must be the supreme guide of the commentator. Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. In his 1893 encyclical Providentissimus Deus, he described the importance of scriptures for theological study.

Belew also designed the suit Elvis is wearing on the famous photo of President Nixon and him in the Oval Office, a velveteen outfit originally designed for Elvis to use in his Las Vegas shows. In an interview Belew explained why most of the jumpsuits were white: \"The lighting [in Las Vegas] was still in its early stages. \"That's Someone You Never Forget\", with concept and title by Presley, was written in conjunction with Red West and possibly in memory of Elvis' deceased mother, Gladys Presley. Presley married Julia Magdaline \"Maggie\" Yingling of Clay, Arkansas in 1911. In late 1923, Presley married Rena Henderson of Faulkner County. The couple had one child together. From 1928 \n\n highlight him. But it just ended up that white was the best thing and, of course, you know, you want the star to be the person, you know, and not the wardrobe.\" During the 1970s Belew designed Elvis' offstage wardrobe, as well. Among the most famous of Belew's Elvis jumpsuits are the American Eagle (created for the 1973 Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite) and the Peacock (first worn at the Forum in Los Angeles in 1974, and later seen on the cover to the 1975 album Promised Land). In 2008 the Peacock suit was sold at an online auction for $300,000.\n\nQuestion: what makes elvis presley famous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The level of immigration from the Netherlands has dropped significantly since the 1980s. The Dutch-born population is also ageing; 52% of the Dutch-born population was aged sixty years old or older in 2006. Of Australian residents born in the Netherlands, 59,502 (75%) were Australian citizens. The history and presence of the Walloon people, i.e. francophone Belgians, in the Netherlands goes back to the foundation process of the Dutch state. Even more so, the region now known as Wallonia was part of the historical Southern Netherlands, a region now divided between the Netherlands, Belgium and the French Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The spoken language is Maaslands (Brabants) (the variant spoken in 's-Hertogenbosch is called Bosch which is placed among the Central North Brabantian dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as East Brabantian), which is very similar to colloquial Dutch.

Once in Greece \n\n  The Cappadocian Greeks traditionally spoke a dialect of the Greek language known as Cappadocian Greek. Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other Byzantine Greek dialects early, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns. In traditional classifications, Hellenic consists of Greek alone, but some linguists group Greek together with various ancient languages thought to have been closely related or distinguish varieties of Greek that are distinct enough to be considered separate languages. In the late Neolithic, speakers of this dialect, which would become Proto-Greek, migrated from their homeland northeast of the Black Sea to the Balkans and into the Greek peninsula. they started using the modern Greek language, causing their ancestral Greek dialect, the Cappadocian Greek language, to go to the brink of extinction. The language was then declared alive in 2005, when descendants of Cappadocian Greeks were discovered still speaking the language fluently in central and northern Greece. Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli.\n\nQuestion: what are the major languages spoken in greece?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication. There are and have been several Chinese alphabets, that is pre-existing alphabets adapted to write down the Chinese language. There is no original alphabet native to China. Simplified Chinese characters replaced Traditional Chinese characters, which the original form is still used today in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. Simplified Chinese is used in mainland China and Singapore. The script of the Han Chinese characters has long been a unifying feature in East Asia (except Mongolia) as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to its East Asian neighbors. The Chinese script was passed on first to Korea and then to Japan, where it forms a major component of the Japanese writing system. ; Lahu, Lisu and Lua people have their own spoken language, but their written language uses the Latin alphabet.\n\nQuestion: what language do chinese people write in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the announcement, Klawans explained that the association was formed to restrict the jumping of players from one member league to another and to recognize the \"territorial rights of its members.\" Later that day, NFL president Bert Bell announced that his league would also join after agreeing on few terms with the minor leagues. As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of \"raids\", the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle also became chief executive of the AFL from July 26, 1966, through the completion of the merger. Nevertheless, McFetridge was a very close friend of Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, and nominated him for mayor in 1954. In 1950, McFetridge was elected a vice-president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). After the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations merged in 1955, McFetridge was elected a vice-president of the AFL-CIO. Although a close ally of Teamsters president Dave Beck, he was also a strong advocate of strict financial practices and worked to cleanse AFL-CIO unions of labor racketeering.

The expedition's cartographer and translator, Antonio Pigafetta, left this description of the place: \"On Tuesday, September 20, in the same year [1519] we departed from the place called Sanlúcar [de Barrameda], heading southwest, and before the end of the month, on the 26th, we arrived at an island that is called Tenerife, at 28 degrees longitude, to acquire meat, water, and firewood. The first direct demonstration of Earth's sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from Seville. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean, passed through what is now called the Strait of Magellan, crossed the Pacific, and arrived in Cebu, where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano, continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation.\n\nQuestion: what country did magellan represent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas. English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first immigration of non-English speakers from Western Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century. Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, primarily European languages. The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Central Field is located to the east of Khafre's causeway and extends to the pyramid town of Queen Khentkaus I. The central field is located at the site of some large stone quarries that provided the stones for the construction of the first two pyramids at Giza. Hence the tombs date to the later part of the Fourth Dynasty and later. It is located on the south side of the Menkaure pyramid in the Giza Necropolis. It is the easternmost of the three pyramids of the queens. The American archaeologist George Andrew Reisner was \"confident\" that the structure housed Khamerernebty II, but this is far from certain.

The city of Lloydminster, which is bisected by the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary, and its immediate surrounding region, observe Mountain Time year-round, with officially sanctioned daylight saving time (which in the summer puts it in synchronization with the rest of Saskatchewan). Along the Manitoba border, the small, remote Saskatchewan towns of Denare Beach and Creighton unofficially observe Central Daylight Time during the summer, thereby keeping the same time as larger neighbouring Manitoba communities. Lloydminster's distinctive situation is reflected in other legal matters, including its time zone. Most of Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time, instead staying on Central Standard Time year-round. This has the effect of placing Lloydminster and the surrounding area in the Mountain Time Zone along with Alberta. South Australia time becomes UTC+10:30, called Central Daylight Time (CDT), possibly with \"Australia\" prefixed (ACDT). Most of Saskatchewan, despite geographically being in the Mountain Time Zone, observes year-round Central Standard Time (CST). In 2020, the Yukon Territory abandoned seasonal time change to permanently observe year-round Mountain Standard Time (MST). Part of the Peace River Regional District (including the communities of Chetwynd, Dawson Creek, Hudson's Hope, Fort St. John, Taylor and Tumbler Ridge) is on Mountain Time and does not observe DST. In 2014, the residents of Fort Nelson voted to stay on MST year-round also, which the community has observed since 2015. ; The East Kootenay region in southeastern British Columbia (including the communities of Cranbrook, Fernie, Sparwood, Golden and Invermere) is on Mountain Time and observes DST.

In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career. During his youth and musical training in Bonn, Beethoven had extensive, intimate exposure to Mozart's music. Written documentation of Beethoven's initial visit to Vienna is sparse; the two composers could conceivably have met. Other types of music that became important in the nineteenth century were grand opera, small pieces for piano; piano sonatas, often with the exploration of new harmonic or tonal ideas. In the late Romantic era, the Austro-German tradition of Wagner dominated musical composition. During this era, French composers such as Debussy and Ravel \n\n Beethoven visited Vienna early in 1787, but accounts differ as to the exact dates. There is evidence for this in the Regensburgische Diarium. Beethoven's return to Bonn was prompted at least in part by his mother's medical condition (she died of tuberculosis in July of that year ). Beethoven's father was nearly incapacitated by alcoholism, and Beethoven had two younger brothers, so it was believed the composer may have been needed at home to \n\n Beethoven eventually returned to Vienna permanently in 1792, the year after Mozart's death. In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky.\n\nQuestion: what music period did beethoven live in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, there are fringe groups who attempt to trivialize the crimes of the Hitler period by comparing German losses to the Holocaust. The next day, Hitler gave a speech in the Reich Chancellery to Nazi Party leaders. The world war \n\n egregious Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history\" and distinguished it from a \"normal war\", as the Nazi regime conducted against France. Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the Reich), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it brought in millions of slave workers from conquered countries, treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return). Germany's economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler's strategy was to change this by a series of surprise blitzkriegs. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies. Even after concluding the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Hitler attempted to avoid a two-front war by keeping the United Kingdom, United States, and possibly France out of the war. At the time, Germans used the phrase \"world war\" for any major conflict between the European powers.\n\nQuestion: what war did hitler lose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl Reactor's proximity to floodplains. A study conducted in 1996 was conducted to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes traced from the disaster area. Further investigation found that the water source feeding the lake provided drinking water for approximately 9 million Ukrainians, as well as provided agricultural irrigation and food for \n\n The Kaliningrad Nuclear Power Plant (also referred as Baltic Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) or Baltiiskaya NPP, Калининградская атомная электростанция; Калининградская АЭС [] or Балтийская АЭС []) is a nuclear power plant under construction 13 km south-east of Neman, in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The site includes two operating pressurized water reactors (each 900MWe), which began operation in 1983.

Not only was he the father and grandfather of presidents; he also was a first cousin, once removed, of Samuel Adams. it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency foundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator Martin Van Buren, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren \n\n In 1720, Adams purchased a farm in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then called the \"north precinct\" of Braintree, Massachusetts). Prior to the 1828 presidential election, he worked with Clay to build the National Republican Party across the country. Despite his efforts and those of Clay, Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson decisively defeated President Adams in the 1828 election. Almost immediately, opposition arose to the Adams presidency.

For the marriage to be legal the license must be notarized and filed with the local county probate office within 30 days of the notarization.

When it was incorporated as a Pennsylvania borough (on October 23, 1871), it was renamed \"Jeddo.\" The borough was named for the biblical village of Emmaus (now within modern Israel), where, according to the New Testament, Jesus was seen by his disciples Luke and Cleopas following his crucifixion and resurrection. From its founding in 1759 until 1830, the settlement's name was spelled \"Emmaus.\" According to History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Volume II, both the Towamensing and Towamencin spellings were in use circa 1884. The same source cites Towamensing as the original spelling, but notes that the Towamencin spelling was in use for government records in Norristown. The name \"Towamensing\" is Lenape in origin and means either \"the place of feeding \n\n Historian Charles A. Hanna suggested \"Sewickley\" came from Creek words for \"raccoon\" (sawi) and \"town\" (ukli).

Some locals alternatively consider Sewickley to be a Native American word meaning \"sweet water.\" Penn Township was formed in 1828 when Muncy Township was divided for the fourth time.

Many physical payments are still made in cash, but increasingly, Germans are using their EC/Maestro. Money is available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian. In monetary economics, the currency in circulation in a country is the value of currency or cash (banknotes and coins) that has ever been issued by the country’s monetary authority less the amount that has been removed. More broadly, money in circulation is the total money supply of a country, which can be defined in various ways, but always includes currency and also some types of bank deposits, such as deposits at call. The published amount of currency in circulation tends to be overstated by an unknown amount because it does not take into account money that has been destroyed, or held by individuals as a form of security (the proverbial “money under the mattress”), or by coin collectors, domestic or foreign, or which is held in reserve within the banking system, including currency held by foreign central banks as a foreign exchange reserve asset.

The Atlas Chemical Company \n\n Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821 for mathematical achievements, he had by that time invented a logometer (an early slide rule), and went on to design and patent a friction wheel and a clock escapement. Brandreth invented a machine which used a horse galloping on a treadmill as its source of motive power. A prototype, the Cycloped, participated in the Rainhill Trials in 1829, but it had to be withdrawn when the horse broke through the floor of the machine. In any case, the trials proved the superiority of steam motive power in all but exceptional circumstances. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (\"On Mechanics\"). He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, they merely transform it. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). James Watt patented his parallel motion linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical.

Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n Australian English arose from a dialectal 'melting pot' created by the intermingling of early settlers who were from a variety of dialectal regions of Great Britain and Ireland. Australian English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. These words of Australian Aboriginal origin include some that are used frequently within Australian-English, such as kangaroo and boomerang.

The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government. The American Revolution established the United States with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments. The United States has the world's oldest written constitution, and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the US Constitution, often word-for-word in places. It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era. Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war. While many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some, yet denying it to others, the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition \n\n The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives.\n\nQuestion: what kind of government did the united states have after the revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Before the Antonine Constitution, being a Roman had been a mark of distinction and often stressed, but after the 3rd century Roman status went without saying. In many cases, ancient Romans associated the same things with their identity as historians do today: the rich ancient Latin literature, the impressive Roman architecture, the common marble statues, the variety of cult sites, the Roman infrastructure and legal tradition, as well as the almost corporate identity of the Roman army were all cultural and symbolic ways to express Roman identity. Whereas Roman identity faded away in most of the lands where it was once prominent, for some regions and peoples it proved considerably more tenacious. 'Romans' has been consistently used since antiquity to describe the citizens of Rome itself, who identify and are described as such to this day. The Greeks continued to identify as Romioi, or \n\n The Romans (Rōmānī; ) were a cultural group, variously referred to as an ethnicity' or a nationality,' that in classical antiquity, from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD, came to rule the Near East, North Africa, and large parts of Europe through conquests made during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire.

Galileo greatly improved upon these designs the following year. The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. In its base were the names of celebrated astronomers: Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. The House of Lorraine-Habsburg was foreign to Tuscany; and the embrace of Galileo can be seen as an attempt to co-opt local patriotism. It contains a large statue of Galileo and a series of lunettes and frescoes depicting events in scientific history relating to Florence. It once contained some of his original instruments such as his geometric and military compass, an armed loadstone, two telescopes, and the objective lens of the telescope with which Galileo discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name \"microscope\" was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625.\n\nQuestion: what objects did galileo see with his telescope?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family's property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea \n\n During the 1940s and 1950s Dalí's interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with nuclear science, feeling that \"thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought\". Aguila studied visual and monumental art at the Higher Institute for Arts and Sciences in St Lucas, Brussels under such artists as Jos De Maegd and Maurits Van Saene. Dalí's most recognised works date from before 1940, when he was preoccupied with the subconscious and the nature of perception. At the end of World War II, a focus on the historical, scientific, and religious was introduced into Dalí's work. But Dalí became an early supporter of Antonio Pitxot's work, and eventually asked him to co-design the Dalí Theatre and Museum (Teatre-Museu Dalí) in Figueres, Spain. There is also a permanent exhibition of Pitxot's work on one floor of that museum. Pitxot and Dalí were nearly inseparable in the last years of Dalí's life: designing Dalí's museum, teaching art and exchanging ideas about their work. Pitxot was a protector of Dalí's legacy after his death: He was a member of the board of the Gala Salvador Dalí Foundation, and he has led, and sat on the board, of several other Dalí foundations. He became the museum's director after Dalí's death.\n\nQuestion: where did salvador dali study art?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother, paternal grandfather and father. He predeceased his father, however, and upon the latter's death on 25 October 1760, the throne passed to Prince Frederick's eldest son, George III. King George VI was the monarch of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and the British Empire from 11 December 1936 until his death on 6 February 1952. He also was a founder and the first Head of the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1722, the 15-year-old Frederick was inoculated against smallpox by Charles Maitland on the instructions of his mother, Caroline. His grandfather George I created him Duke of Edinburgh, Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham in the county of Kent, Viscount of Launceston in the county of Cornwall, and Baron of Snaudon in the county of Carnarvon, on 26 July 1726.\n\nQuestion: who was the father of king george vi?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
