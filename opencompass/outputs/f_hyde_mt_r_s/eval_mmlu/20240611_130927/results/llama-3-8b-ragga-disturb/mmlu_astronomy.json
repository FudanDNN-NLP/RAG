Apparent magnitude also adds up (integrates) over the entire object, so it is focus independent. This needs to be taken into account when scaling exposure times for objects with significant apparent size, like the sun, moon and planets. For example, directly scaling the exposure time from the moon to the sun works, because they are approximately the same size in the sky, but scaling the exposure from the moon to Saturn would result in an overexposure, if the image of Saturn takes up a smaller area on your sensor than the moon did. (at the same magnification or more generally f/#)\n\n The Greek astronomer Hipparchus established a numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appearing in the sky. The difference between them corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness. Flux decreases with distance according to an inverse-square law, so the apparent magnitude of a star depends on both its absolute brightness and its distance (and any extinction). In contrast, the intrinsic brightness of an astronomical object, does not depend on the distance of the observer or any extinction.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

When the angle between the sun and the horizon is less than 10 percent, as it is just after sunrise or just prior to sunset, sunlight becomes too red due to refraction for any colors other than those with a reddish hue to be seen.

The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light is composed of the shorter wavelengths of blue and violet.

In contrast, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table, both forces acting on the same book. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's second law. Objects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation only feel no g-force, a condition known as zero-g (which means zero g-force).

A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the coastal shelf of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark \n\n  Astronomers think the collision between Earth and Theia happened at about 4.4 to 4.45 bya; about 0.1 billion years after the Solar System began to form. In astronomical terms, the impact would have been of moderate velocity.

It was discovered 0.2 AU (30,000,000 km; 19,000,000 mi) from Earth and is roughly 200 meters in diameter. It has an interstellar speed (velocity at infinity) of 26.33 km/s (58,900 mph).

On 6 December 2006 NASA released photos of two craters in Terra Sirenum and Centauri Montes which appear to show the presence of flowing water on Mars at some point between 1999 and 2001. Many locations on Mars have sand dunes. Many martian dunes strongly resemble terrestrial dunes but images acquired by the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have shown that martian dunes in the north polar region are subject to modification via grainflow triggered by seasonal CO2 sublimation, a process not seen on Earth. Extraterrestrial sand seas such as those found on Mars are referred to as \"undae\" from the Latin for waves. Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. High levels of hydrogen (probably from water) have been found with Mars Odyssey. The Phoenix Lander found water ice directly since it landed in a field of polygons and its landing rockets exposed a pure ice surface. This cracking of ice-rich ground is predicted based on physical processes. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. ,\n\n There is great deal of evidence that water once flowed in river valleys on Mars.

Lunar magma cannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing fewer lunar maria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible from Earth.

The length that Eratosthenes intended for a 'stade' is not known, but his figure only has an error of around one to fifteen percent.

Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simplify calculations; other historians of science, on the other side, believe that Eratosthenes introduced a new length unit based on the length of the meridian, as stated by Pliny, who writes about the stadion \"according to Eratosthenes' ratio\".

Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, Alexandria and Syene, modern Assuan: Under the previous assumptions, writes Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a gnomon) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on \n\n Under the assumption that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes performed an experiment using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of Earth.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

NGC 1763 (also known as N11 B, LH 10 or ESO 85-EN20) is an emission nebula with an embedded star cluster in the Dorado constellation in the Large Magellanic Cloud, It is very bright, very large and very irregular. It is also part of an area commonly known as the Bean Nebula. The Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) is a joint project of Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile) and the University of Michigan using the CTIO Curtis/Schmidt Telescope. The main goal of the project is to trace the ionized gas in the Magellanic Clouds using narrow-band filters ([S II], Hα and [O III]). 2012: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...755...40P/abstract\n\n NGC 1755 (also known as ESO 56-SC28) is an open star cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud in the Dorado constellation, It is about 120 light years across and due to its size could be a globular cluster.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

In 2012, The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has found that the permanently shadowed regions have a porous, powdery surface, that indicates the presence of water ice. Several of such craters show indications of water ice in their interiors, including Rozhdestvenskiy and Cabeus craters on the Moon, and Juling Crater on Ceres. The craters may also contain unusually high concentrations of helium-3. For example, there are 2 peaks near Shackleton Crater that are illuminated a \n\n is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe &ndash; the Phoebe ring. This approach is similar to what NASA is doing at the Moon under the Artemis program – sending astronauts to lunar South Pole, where ice is trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the pole. Such explorers may one day core, sample, and analyze the ice to better understand the\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The galactic tail and all within it are escaping the galaxy to become intracluster flotsam, unattached to any galaxy, just the cluster. PLCKESZ G286.6-31.3 is a galaxy cluster that is seen through the outer fringes of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it has 530 trillion times the Sun's mass, it can host up to 100 galaxies and hosts more than 700 star clusters inside the galaxy cluster, along with additions from hundreds to thousands of supergiant stars, and is invisible to the naked eye. Voids are affected by the way gravity causes matter in the universe to \"clump together\", herding galaxies into clusters and chains, which are separated by regions mostly devoid of galaxies, yet the exact mechanisms are subject to scientific debate. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. The Solar System orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
