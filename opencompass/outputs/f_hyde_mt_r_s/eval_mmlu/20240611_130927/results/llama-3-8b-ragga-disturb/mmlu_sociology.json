Mass society theory argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached. Mass society arose when society was no longer directed by an identifiable and stable structure of elites, when the vulgar appetites of the masses supplanted \"the canons of refinement and sober restraint.\" The masses cannot simply take over the role served previously by elites; they can express desires but not values. The second group of mass society theorists, those who emphasized social disintegration and the quality of participation, was best represented by Emil Lederer, Erich Fromm, and Sigmund Neumann. They defined \n\n Much of Herman's scholarship has focused on developing the propaganda model to explain how \"market forces, internalized assumptions and self-censorship\" motivate newspapers and television networks to stifle dissent. Rather than needing direct control over the media as in dictatorships, industrial democracies control popular opinion using \"filters\" which prevent politically controversial ideas from reaching the public. Chomsky and Herman specify five filters, in particular: the concentration of media ownership to a few corporations, the need to please advertisers and funding sources, the reliance on government-provided sources, flak, and anti-communist ideology. These influences combine to prevent politically inconvenient knowledge and ideas from reaching the general public.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city. There are four central approaches to the anthropological study of cities. The first is the urban ecology model in which the community and family network are \n\n Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

He has said that maturity led him to understand that his drug use was dangerous and has repeatedly stated his opposition to legalized drugs, including marijuana. He has said, \"I oppose the legalization of marijuana because, as noted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, marijuana can have serious adverse health effects on individuals. (1967) reported that pure THC (which had only recently been chemically isolated with its chemical structure identified) had marijuana-like effects (e.g., increased pulse rate (tachycardia) and altered time sense), whether smoked or taken orally. ; Isbell and Jasinski (1969) compared LSD (1.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, injected intramuscularly) and smoked THC (225 or 250 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, added to a tobacco cigarette). Physical symptoms were quite different (e.g., tachycardia with THC, dilated pupils with LSD), and tolerance to LSD did not cause \n\n The term amotivational syndrome was first devised to understand and explain the diminished drive and desire to work or compete among the population of youth who are frequent consumers of cannabis and has since been researched through various methodological studies with this focus on cannabis, or marijuana.

Cannabis related amotivational syndrome is closely tied with cannabis use disorder which is recognized in the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and has similar conditions such as withdrawing and giving up from daily activities \n\n According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as of 2015–2016, 19.5% of Washington adults aged 18 or older have used cannabis within the past year, relative to the national average, which was estimated at 13.9% by the same survey.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

More recently those in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity, supporting the idea of a working-class majority. The consensus has been that the workers had their own political and cultural value system. For most of American history, social class barriers were fundamentally rigid, with various private and public institutions enforcing rules based on racial segregation and other forms of classifying people based on prejudices such as antisemitism and Hispanophobia. Issues regarding social class have remained hot-button topics in U.S. politics, with the American Great Recession causing massive socio-economic harm across the country from southerners to northerners to working-class whites to middle-class blacks\n\n this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class. Middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels.

In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a \"unity of will\". It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin, whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for \n\n In the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state. While there are differences between each, including whether their adherents personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\", each still classifies as anti-authoritarian socialism. Of Proudhon's philosophy, Geoffrey Ostergaard summarized \"he argued that working men should emancipate themselves, not by political but by economic means, through the voluntary organization of their own labour—a concept to which he attached redemptive value. His proposed system of equitable exchange between self-governing producers, organized individually or in association and financed by free credit, was called 'mutualism'. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\").\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

However, given the increase in income inequality of the past few decades, either the sign of the effect must be reversed, or the magnitude of the effect must be small and a much larger opposing force has overridden it. The study found the decline in progressivity since 1960 was due to the shift from allocation of corporate income taxes among labor and capital to the effects of the individual income tax. Paul Krugman also supports this claim saying, \"The overall tax rate on these high income families fell from 36.5% in 1980 to 26.7% in 1989.\" All top earners were helped by deep cuts in estate and capital gains taxes, and tax rates on high levels of income. Inventions of the 20th century such as AC electric power, the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with greater inequality. Causes of income inequality in the United States describes the reasons for the unequal distribution of income in the US and the factors that cause it to change over time. Income inequality in the United States grew significantly beginning in the early 1970s,  after several decades of stability. The US consistently exhibits higher rates of income inequality than most developed nations, arguably due to the nation's relatively less regulated markets.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

There are different behavioral attitudes that humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in cannibalism. When asked a question, the youth typically respond with \"okay\" or \n\n perspective (such as statistics showing that the behavior or event is actually less common or less harmful than generally believed) tend to be ignored by the press. Members of the public are motivated to keep informed on these events, leading to high readership for the stories, feeding the spiral. The resulting publicity has the potential to increase the deviant behavior by glamorizing it, or by making it seem common or acceptable. This fear stems from the belief that the person will be evaluated negatively, or embarrass themselves. SAD is also considered to be one \n\n According to sociologist Stanley Cohen, the spiral starts with some deviant act. Usually the deviance is criminal, but it can also involve lawful acts considered morally repugnant by a large segment of society.

National labor leaders, wide-awake as to what might happen in the future, decided that the new movement was a menace to their organization, and at once inaugurated \n\n unions). In management literature today, the term \"scientific management\" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples (\"classical\", implying \"no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value\") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Management and business leadership as a profession arose during the industrial revolution with the advent of businesses much too large to be managed by a single entrepreneur. Frederick Winslow Taylor developed the scientific theory of management which he published in the journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1895. Scientific Management \n\n The early history of labor relations with scientific management in the U.S. was described by Horace Bookwalter Drury: \"...for a long time there was thus little or no direct [conflict] between scientific management and organized labor...

According to Marxist feminists, women's liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women's labor is uncompensated. Marxist feminists extend traditional Marxist analysis by applying it to unpaid domestic labor and sex relations. Because of its foundation in historical materialism, Marxist feminism is similar to socialist feminism and, to a greater degree, materialist feminism. subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay \"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex\", in which she coins the phrase \"sex/gender system\" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process. More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions as a result of gaining access to productive labor. Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists advocated for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, Heidi Hartmann (1981) argues that these efforts \"take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

And Unger's proposal offers the United States a chance to enact a fitting sequel to the New Deal, the promise of which was betrayed by decades of misguided progressive policies \n\n Impossibilism is a Marxist theory that stresses the limited value of political, economic, and social reforms under capitalism. Impossibilism holds that reforms to capitalism are irrelevant or outright counter-productive to the goal of achieving socialism and should not be a major focus of socialist politics. Impossibilists insist that socialists should primarily or solely focus on structural changes (sometimes termed \"revolutionary changes\") to society as opposed to advancing social reforms. Impossibilists argue that spontaneous revolutionary action is the only viable method of instituting the structural changes necessary for the construction of socialism; impossibilism is thus held in contrast to reformist socialist parties that aim to rally support for \n\n The socio-economic gaps between Māori and non-Māori stem from a history of colonialism.

A good example of this is Tourette syndrome, which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of masturbation caused by sexual repression. This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting neurology and psychiatry because both are dealing with disorders of the same system. Proposed benefits of taking an evolutionary perspective on mental disorders have largely come from integrating evolutionary explanations into psychotherapy. Bailey and Gilbert write:\"'The evolutionary approach helps to answer three fundamental questions about humanity that go to the heart of professional helping and clinical practice: First, what and who are we as human beings – that is, what is human nature or species ‘normality’? ; and, third, what can professional helpers and psychotherapists do to ameliorate or even ‘cure’ the \n\n Association examined niacin monotherapy of patient populations with chronic schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and rejected the practice along with the reliability of Hoffer's diagnostic approach.

After 1975, orthomolecular psychiatry research was primarily reported in Orthomolecular Psychiatry, now the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine, a publication founded by Hoffer to counter what he considered to be a medical conspiracy against his ideas.

Some scholars have argued that modern Western social movements became possible through education (the wider dissemination of literature) and increased mobility of labor due to the industrialization and urbanization of 19th-century societies. It is sometimes argued that the freedom of expression, education and relative economic independence prevalent in the modern Western culture are responsible for the unprecedented number and scope of various contemporary social movements. A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure—referred to as \"social organization\" by the classical theorists—with respect to the whole as well as the necessary function of the whole's constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by Herbert Spencer) is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work towards the proper functioning of the entire 'body' of society. Social research has influence throughout various industries and sectors of life, such as among politicians, policy makers, and legislators; educators; planners; administrators; developers; business magnates and managers; social workers; non-governmental organizations; and non-profit organizations, as well as individuals interested in resolving social issues in general. Occasionally, social movements have been involved in democratizing nations, but more often they have flourished after democratization. Modern movements often use technology and the internet to mobilize people globally. Adapting to communication trends is a common theme among successful movements. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Whitney states, \"The daily struggle of unemployed persons and the domestic toil of housewives no less than the waged worker are thus part of the production and reproduction of social life, and of the biopolitical growth of capital that valorizes information and subjectivities.\" The concept of emotional labor, particularly the emotional labor that is present and required in pink collar jobs, was introduced by Arlie Russell Hochschild in her book The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling (1983) in which she considers the affective labor of the profession as flight attendants smile, exchange pleasantries and banter with customers. In the majority of cases, clients value women who they perceive as normatively feminine. The emotional labor involved in sex work may be of a greater significance when race differences are involved. She makes her clients, who are mostly white heterosexual men, read Black feminist theory before their sessions. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals.

Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries. highlights the relation between popular movements and the formation of new political parties as well as discussing the function of social movements in relation to agenda setting and influence on politics.

Some scholars have argued that modern Western social movements became possible through education (the wider dissemination of literature) and increased mobility of labor due to the industrialization and urbanization of 19th-century societies. Sociology is a social science that focuses on society, human social behaviour, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life.

Weber described four categories of \"Ideal Types\" of behavior: zweckrational (goal-rationality), wertrational (value-rationality), affektual (emotional-rationality) and traditional (custom, unconscious habit). Weber, who is keenly aware of the fictional nature of the \"ideal type\", therefore states that it never seeks to claim its validity in terms of a reproduction of or \n\n Ideal type (Idealtypus), also known as pure type, is a typological term most closely associated with sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920). This does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can be gained by \"weighing the various evaluations against one another and making a 'statesman-like' compromise among them\", which is often proposed as a solution by those sharing Weber's kind of methodological perspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls \"syncretism\", is not only impossible but also unethical, for it avoids \"the practical duty to stand up for our own ideals\" [Weber 1904/1949, p. 58 ]. It is also important to pay attention that in using the word \"ideal\" Max Weber refers to the world of ideas (Gedankenbilder, \"mental images\") and not to perfection; these \"ideal types\" are idea-constructs that help put the seeming chaos of social \n\n described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human \"social action\"—especially among \"ideal types\", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\").\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

In Catholic ecclesiology, a church is an assembly of the faithful, hierarchically ordered, both in the entire world (the Catholic Church), or in a certain territory (a particular church). More specifically, it is the local bishop, with his priests and deacons gathered around and assisting him in his office of teaching, sanctifying and governing (Mt. John Locke defined a church as \"a voluntary society of men, joining themselves together of their own accord in order to the public worshipping of God in such manner as they judge acceptable to him\". A local church may be run using congregationalist polity and may be associated with other similar congregations in a denomination or convention, as are the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention or like German or Swiss Landeskirchen. It may be united with other parishes under the oversight of bishops, as are Anglican, Lutheran, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Orthodox churches. Such association or unity is a church's ecclesiastical polity. Many are formally organized, with constitutions and by-laws, maintain offices, are served by clergy or lay leaders, and, in nations where this is permissible, often seek non-profit corporate status. Depending on the tradition, these organizations may connect local churches to larger church traditions, ordain and defrock clergy, define terms of membership and exercise church discipline, and have organizations for cooperative ministry such as educational institutions and missionary societies. a church as follows: \"A group of Christ's faithful hierarchically linked in accordance with law and given express or tacit recognition by the supreme authority of the Church is in this Code called an autonomous Church.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

The federal programs also provided aid to the former slaves and attempted to integrate them into society as citizens. Both during and after this period, blacks \n\n Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves. The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a severe negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death. Others fled or crowded into refugee camps operated by the Freedmen's Bureau. The Bureau provided food, housing, clothing, medical care, church services, some schooling, legal support, and arranged for labor contracts. The shift from indentured servants to African slaves was prompted by a dwindling class of former servants who had worked through the terms of their indentures and thus became competitors to their former masters. These newly freed servants were rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was increasingly dominated by large planters. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm in regions dominated by plantations. With the rise of a plantation \n\n the United States abolished slavery, partly in response to the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804. Slavery continued to exist in Africa, where Arab slave traders raided black areas for new captives to be sold in the system.

While at the Chicago School (sociology), he joined with sociologists Robert Park and Ernest Burgess in conducting observation studies of crime in Chicago, Illinois. As a professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University (1925 – 1940), Reckless shifted his focus to the study of juvenile delinquency. In their 1932 book Juvenile Delinquency, he and Mapheus Smith (professor at the University of Kansas) focused on juvenile offenders; the book included court dispositions as well as physical and social characteristics of the delinquents (i.e., physical and mental traits, social backgrounds, and school maladjustments). Sociologist Jack Katz is recognized by many as being a foundational figure to this approach through his seminal work, Seductions of Crime, written in 1988. Cultural criminology as a substantive approach, however, did not begin to form until the mid-1990s, where increasing interest arose from the desire to incorporate cultural studies into contemporary criminology. Developed in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the approach has had transnational impacts. Recent theories within cultural criminology take into account the role of space (such as urban space) in the construction of crime, positing, for example, that where an action takes place is as important as the effect of the action in determining criminality. While these new \n\n motivated by these ideological justifications. They saw their crime as influential in the way that it might subvert moral codes enforced by an unjust system and participated in illegalism in hopes of generating tangible structural change. In this way, they were not as closely affiliated with the individualist milieu than other illegalists. Other illegalists, such as Jules Bonnot, were less concerned with the propagandist component of praxis, but rather saw the crime itself as the insurrection. They valued life in a state of rebellion to their society over the promotion of social revolution.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.
