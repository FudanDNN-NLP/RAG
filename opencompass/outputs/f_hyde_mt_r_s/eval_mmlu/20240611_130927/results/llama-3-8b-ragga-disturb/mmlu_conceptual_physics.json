That is, the object and fluid have the same density when the specific gravity equals one and the submerged specific gravity equals zero. This fact highlights the utility of the usage of submerged specific gravity in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on submerged objects: the object will naturally rise when its submerged specific gravity is negative, and sink when its submerged specific gravity is positive. Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. immersed in fluids on Earth, they have some degree of buoyancy. Although no \n\n Again, unlike the effect that low-gravity environments have on weight, buoyancy does not make a portion of an object's weight vanish; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground, which leaves less force (weight) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question (though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition). If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in, they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the \n\n and, ultimately, the scale underneath the pool.

As the field varies inside the loop, it generates a voltage by Faraday's law of induction, driving a current. The voltage induced is determined by:  \n\n Like all dynamos, the Faraday disc converts kinetic energy to electrical energy. This machine can be analysed using Faraday's own law of electromagnetic induction. This law, in its modern form, states that the full-time derivative of the magnetic flux through a closed circuit induces an electromotive force in the circuit, which in turn drives an electric current. The magnetic flux through a magnetic component is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the cross sectional area of that component. For example, the total reluctance By Stokes's theorem, the closed line integral of H·dl around a contour is equal to the open surface integral of curl H·dA across the surface bounded by the closed contour. Since, from Maxwell's equations, curl H = J , the closed line integral of H·dl evaluates to the total current passing through the surface. This is equal to the excitation, NI , which also measures current passing through the surface, thereby verifying that the net current flow through a surface is zero ampere-turns in a closed system that conserves energy. This law, formulated thirty years after Faraday's death, states that the force on an electron is proportional to the cross product of its velocity and the magnetic flux vector.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

It has been noted that there is considerable misunderstanding over the effect of light quality on plant growth. The results were optically visible, where the BIPS in gels turned from a colorless appearance to a brown or pink color after repeatedly being exposed to a high energy UV pump beam. High energy photons cause a transformation in the BIPS molecule making the molecule change its structure. The excited state originates from the interaction between a photon and the quantum system.

Consequently, in \n\n Though classically spacetime appears to be an absolute background, general relativity reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry. - John Archibald Wheeler Also, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences.

In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of geodesics. As a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit gravitational waves, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like many other aspects of relativity) has been experimentally confirmed by astronomers—most dramatically in the direct detection of gravitational waves originating from a black hole merger when they passed through LIGO in 2015.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors and between two conductors of the same phase. Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle warning lamps on radio antenna masts. In higher power transmitters powered by AC, a transformer steps the input voltage up to the high voltage needed. Since the AC sine wave has two peaks per cycle, ideally two sparks occurred during each cycle, so the spark rate was equal to twice the frequency of the AC power (often multiple sparks occurred during the peak of each half cycle). However higher audio frequencies cut through interference better, so in many transmitters the transformer was powered by a motor-alternator set, an electric motor with its shaft turning an alternator, that produced AC at a higher frequency, usually 500 Hz, resulting in a spark rate of 1000 Hz.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines.

The distance to this point is called the range of the particle. The range depends on the type of particle, on its initial energy and on the material through which it passes. For example, if the ionising particle passing through the material is a positive ion like an alpha particle or proton, it will collide with atomic electrons in the material via Coulombic interaction. A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and sometimes less-massive particle–antiparticle pairs. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or light. The amount of energy released is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the notable mass–energy equivalence equation, . If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions. The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force.

Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its planetary albedo, is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features. Such radiative forcing is quantified based on the CO2 amount in the tropopause, in units of watts per square meter to the Earth's surface.

Production was high enough in 1994 to help make New Mexico the second largest producer of pumice among the United States. The pumice itself is unconsolidated and easily removed once the overburden (typically Otowi Member ignimbrite) is removed. Much of the pumice was strip mined from public lands before reclamation bonds were required, leaving mining scars that are slowly revegetating. There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish plutonic from volcanic rock. For example, the alkali feldspar in plutonic rocks is typically orthoclase, while the higher-temperature polymorph, sanidine, is more common in volcanic rock. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition. Pyroclastic density currents can also produce ash particles. Within pyroclastic density currents particle abrasion occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within \n\n The density of individual particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200 kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450 kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300 kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200 kg/m3 for lithic particles. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) together with a high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Red is the color most commonly associated with love, followed at a great distance by pink. It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose, is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine's Day. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers – giving a single red rose meant \n\n trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis... people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black.\" Similar theories have been expounded by the University of Liverpool's Paul Knox, who stated that \n\n  Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces.

The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. ; Some of the helicopter crashes are caused by resonance too.

He applied all these principles to a case of chromatic polarization not covered by Biot's formulae, involving two successive laminae with axes separated by 45°, \n\n  In a memoir dated 9 December 1822, Fresnel coined the terms linear polarization (French: polarisation rectiligne) for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180° out of phase, circular polarization for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter-cycle (±90°) out of phase, and elliptical polarization for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference. If these \n\n propagated at slightly different speeds, the phase difference between them – and therefore the direction of their linearly-polarized resultant – would vary continuously with distance. Hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed \n\n an analyzer with the appropriate orientation. Light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization (e.g., by passage through a crystal lamina, or by total internal reflection) was described as partly or fully \"depolarized\" because of its behavior in an analyzer. By that definition, elliptically or circularly polarized light is fully polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone. if polarization consisted in a transverse motion. And it was Young, not Fresnel, who first published the idea that polarization depends on the orientation of a transverse vibration.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.
