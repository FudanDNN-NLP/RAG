Wireless clients that associate to a snarf access point will receive an IP, DNS, and gateway and appear completely normal. Users will have all of their DNS queries resolve to the attacker's IP number, regardless of their DNS settings, so any website they attempt to visit will bring up a snarf \"splash page\", requesting a username and password. The username and password entered by unsuspecting users will be mailed to root@localhost. In the case of FTP, this port differs from the listening port. Some protocols—including FTP, FTP Secure, FASP, and Tsunami—listen on a \"control port\" or \"command port\", at which they receive commands from the client. When packets are queued up on one end of a congested link, the node usually has some freedom in deciding the order in which it should send the queued packets. One example ordering is simply first-come, first-served, which works fine if the sizes of the queues are small, but can result in problems if there are latency sensitive packets being blocked by packets from bursty, higher bandwidth applications. A thorough checksum is hence best done at the endpoints, and the network maintains a relatively low level of complexity and reasonable performance for all clients.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school computer science.

The term is used to describe, for example, the scanning of analog sources (such as printed photos or taped videos) into computers for editing, 3D scanning that creates 3D modeling of an object's surface, and audio (where sampling rate is often measured in kilohertz) and texture map transformations. Digitizing is the primary way of storing images in a form suitable for transmission and computer processing, whether scanned from two-dimensional analog originals or captured using an image sensor-equipped device such as a digital camera, tomographical instrument such as a CAT scanner, or acquiring precise dimensions from a real-world object, such as a car, using a 3D scanning device. Different from image quality, which is often referred to as the subject preference for one image over another, image fidelity represents to the ability of a process to render an image accurately, without any visible distortion or information loss. If we cannot detect the difference between a photograph and a digitally printed image, we might conclude that the digital print has photographic image quality. But subjective impressions of image quality are much more difficult to characterize and, consequently, nearly impossible to quantify. The result is called digital representation or, more specifically, a digital image, for the object, and digital form, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitates processing by digital computers and other operations, but, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system can be used instead. Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school computer science.

The programming activity was probably fairly short-lived as simple tasks are quick and easy to complete.

To convert a hexadecimal number into its binary equivalent, simply substitute the corresponding binary digits:  To convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, divide it into groups of four bits.

In Denmark, the proportion of female graduates in computer science increased from 15% to 24% between 2000 and 2012 and Germany saw an increase from 10% to 17%. In Turkey, for instance, the proportion of women graduating in computer science rose from a relatively high 29% to 33% between 2000 and 2012.

The work is now done on the way forward from the list's start, before the recursive call which then proceeds further, instead of backward from the list's end, after the recursive call has returned its result. Elements are added to the rear list and are removed from the front list. The following fragment defines a recursive function in C that duplicates a linked list (with some equivalent Scheme and Prolog code as comments, for comparison): In this form the function is not tail recursive, because control returns to the caller after the recursive call duplicates the rest of the input list. Even if it were to allocate the head node before duplicating the rest, it would still need to plug in the result of the recursive call into the  field after the call. Warren's method pushes the responsibility of filling the  field into the recursive call itself, which thus becomes tail call: (A sentinel head node is used to simplify the code.)

That is, the runtime environment may place original file handles in a hard-coded address range, and not provide file handle behaviour to a user-created copy at another address.

Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: In Python 3, what is the output of print tuple[0] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )?\nA. ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )\nB. abcd\nC. Error\nD. None of the above.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
            "origin_prediction": "The correct answer is B. abcd.\n\nExplanation:\nIn Python 3, when you assign a value to a variable, it becomes a reference to that object. So, when you do `tuple = ('abcd', 786, 2.",
