There are several needle gauges for a phlebotomist to choose from. The most commonly used are as follows: a 21g (green top) needle, a 22g (black top) needle, a 21g (green label) butterfly needle, a 23g (light blue label) butterfly needle, and a 25g (orange or dark blue label) butterfly needle (however this needle is only used in pediatrics or extreme cases as it is so small that it can often result in hemolyzing the blood sample). The formulas are only a guide, with infusions ideally tailored to a urinary output of >30 mL/h in adults or >1mL/kg in children and mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg. While lactated Ringer's solution is often used, there is no evidence that it is superior to normal saline. Blood transfusions are rarely required. This method can be preferred on the elderly, those with cancer, severe burns, obesity, or where the veins are unreliable or fragile. In children or other circumstances where the quantity of blood gained may be limited it can be helpful to know how much blood can be obtained before distributing it amongst the various additives that the laboratory will require.

The prolonged sustenance of running \n\n The physiology of marathons is typically associated with high demands on a marathon runner's cardiovascular system and their locomotor system. Marathon runners finish at different times because of individual physiological characteristics. The differing efficiency of certain physiological features in marathon runners evidence the variety of finishing times among elite marathon runners that share similarities in many physiological characteristics. Aside from large aerobic capacities and other biochemical mechanisms, external factors such as the environment and proper nourishment of a marathon runner can further the insight as to why marathon performance is variable despite ideal physiological characteristics obtained by a runner. This causes a higher anaerobic to aerobic energy ratio during a marathon. Uncertainty exists about how lactate threshold effects endurance performance. Upon successful transportation and distribution of oxygen in the blood, the extraction and use of the blood within skeletal muscle are what give effect to a marathoner's increased aerobic capacity and the overall improvement of an individual's marathon performance. Environmental factors such as air resistance, rain, terrain, and heat contribute to a marathon runner's ability to perform at their full physiological ability. Air resistance or wind, and the marathon course terrain (hilly or flat) are factors. Temperature, in particular heat, is the strongest environmental impediment to marathon performance. There are other environmental factors less directly associated with marathon performance such as the pollutants in the air and even prize money associated with a specific marathon itself.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

Some chronic general medical conditions have been linked to some aspects of mental disorders, such as AIDS-related psychosis. Research shows that infections and exposure to toxins such as HIV and streptococcus cause dementia and OCD. The infections or toxins that trigger a change in the brain chemistry can develop into a mental disorder. Brain degeneration also causes central nervous system diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases). The main causes are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease because they affect or deteriorate brain functions. Other diseases and conditions that cause NCDs include vascular dementia, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body disease, prion disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and dementia/neurocognitive issues due to HIV infection. They may also include dementia due to substance abuse or exposure to toxins. This is referred to as amnesia, and is characterized by damage to major memory encoding parts of the brain such as the hippocampus. Difficulty creating recent term memories is called anterograde amnesia and is caused by damage to the hippocampus part of the brain, which is a major part of the memory process.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

This causes a higher anaerobic to aerobic energy ratio during a marathon. The higher the velocity and fractional use of aerobic capacity an individual has at their lactic threshold, the better their overall performance. Uncertainty exists about how lactate threshold effects endurance performance. The inability to establish a singular set of physiological contributions to blood lactate accumulation's effect on the exercising individual creates a correlative role for lactate threshold in marathon performance as opposed to a causal role. is attributed to a high turnover rate of fatty acids that allows the runner to preserve glycogen stores later into the race. The body uses this energy pathway for lower intensity exercise that lasts longer than three minutes, which corresponds to the rate at which the body produces ATP using oxygen. The anaerobic glycolytic energy pathway is the source of human energy after the first 30 seconds of an exercise until 3 minutes into that exercise. The first 30 seconds of exercise are most heavily reliant on the phosphogenic pathway for energy production. To sustain high intensity running, a marathon runner must obtain sufficient glycogen stores. With low levels of glycogen stores at the onset of the marathon, premature depletion of these stores can reduce performance or even prevent completion of the race.

Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies and there is a risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

The co-A is then exchanged with carnitine (via the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) to produce a fatty acid-carnitine complex. This complex is then transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane via a transporter protein called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the  synthesis of fatty acids. This is the fate of acetyl-CoA wherever beta oxidation of fatty acids occurs, except under certain circumstances in the liver. Red blood cells do not contain mitochondria and are therefore incapable of metabolizing fatty acids; the tissues of the central nervous system cannot use fatty acids, despite containing mitochondria, because long chain fatty acids (as opposed to medium chain fatty acids  ) cannot cross the blood brain barrier into the interstitial fluids that bathe these cells. ; Once inside the cell long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase catalyzes the reaction between a fatty acid molecule with ATP (which is broken down to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate) to give a fatty acyl-adenylate, which then reacts \n\n free coenzyme A to give a fatty acyl-CoA molecule. ; In order for the acyl-CoA to enter the mitochondrion the carnitine shuttle is used: 1) Acyl-CoA is transferred to the hydroxyl group of carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, located on the cytosolic faces of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. ; 3) Acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, located on the interior face of the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

Approximately 91% of people test positive for Sd(a) through blood typing, and 96% test positive through urine testing. The Sd(a++) phenotype is rare, especially in Europe, but may be more common in East Asian populations. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Some bodybuilding supplements claim to reduce the protein breakdown by reducing or blocking the number of catabolic hormones within the body. This is believed to increase anabolism. However, if protein breakdown falls too low then the body would not be able to remove muscle cells that have been damaged during workouts which would in turn prevent the growth of new muscle cells.

The breakdown of glycogen, known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose 1-phosphate (G1P). G6P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G6P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the citric acid cycle, which ultimately generates ATP through oxygen-dependent oxidative phosphorylation. When oxygen \n\n Damage to skeletal muscle may take various forms. The swelling itself may lead to destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier of energy in the cell. ; Branches are made by glycogen branching enzyme (also known as amylo-α(1:4)→α(1:6)transglycosylase), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part via α-1:6 glycosidic bond, forming branches, which further grow by addition of more α-1:4 glycosidic units. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules in the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. ; The enzyme glycogenin is needed to create initial short glycogen chains, which are then lengthened and branched by the other enzymes of glycogenesis.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

The contraction of all the sarcomeres results in the contraction of the whole muscle fiber. These wrap \n\n In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, \n\n Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle, and are more usually known as muscle fibers because of their longer threadlike appearance. Skeletal muscle fibers are the only muscle cells that are multinucleated with the nuclei usually referred to as myonuclei. This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus to the newly formed muscle cell or myotube. Fusion depends on muscle-specific proteins known as fusogens called myomaker and myomerger.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

These steps can be easily remembered with the mnemonic PERRLA (D+C): Pupils Equal and Round; Reactive to Light and Accommodation (Direct and Consensual). A swinging-flashlight test may also be desirable if neurologic damage is suspected. This test detects the afferent pupil defect, also referred to as the Marcus \n\n pupil. If there is an efferent defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally. If there is an afferent defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is \n\n an intact efferent path, and an intact consensual pupillary reflex). A total CN II lesion, in which the affected eye perceives no light, is very similar to a Marcus Gunn pupil; to distinguish them, in a CNII total lesion shining the light in the affected eye produces zero dilation nor constriction. If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a neuropathy is present. If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

In this way, if there is doubt about whether the patient has too much thyroid hormone because of de Quervain's thyroiditis, then measuring radio-iodine uptake or technetium uptake gives a clear cut answer as it will be higher than normal in standard thyrotoxicosis and lower than normal in de Quervain's. ; 2) Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles. ; 4) * Some actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function.

More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively. Hepatic encephalopathy may also occur after the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex, and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol. This large, atypical hemangioma of the liver may present with abdominal pain or fullness due to hemorrhage, thrombosis or mass effect. Further complications are Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, a form of consumptive coagulopathy due to thrombocytopaenia, and rupture. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy can only be made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy \n\n Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC ) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. It occurs in the setting of chronic liver inflammation, and is most closely linked to chronic viral hepatitis infection (hepatitis B or C) or exposure to toxins such as alcohol, aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

Increased gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior activity will provide stiffness to the ankle joint, helping to prevent the spraining of the ankle. Decreased activity of the gastrocnemius will allow for a more complete dorsiflexion and inversion by the tibialis anterior pulling the foot both up and inward, preventing the foot from staying in contact with the potentially damaging surface. Sural nerve (SN) stimulation results in a reflex that is both phase and intensity dependent. The sural nerve innervates the lateral (outside) portion of the foot and could be activated during either the swing or \n\n  When the patellar tendon is tapped just below the knee, the tap initiates an action potential in a specialized structure known as a muscle spindle located within the quadriceps. The result of this motor nerve activity is contraction of the quadriceps muscle, leading to extension of the lower leg at the knee (i.e. Ultimately, an improper patellar reflex may indicate an injury of the central nervous system. The sensory input from the quadriceps also activates local interneurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine onto motor neurons of antagonist muscles, blocking their stimulation (in this case the hamstring muscles). ; Decreased tibialis anterior activity allows the gastrocnemius to more completely plantar flex, or point the toe. ; Increased vastus lateralis activity produces a co-contraction of the hamstrings and quadriceps, which provides increased knee stability in case of a stumble or fall.
