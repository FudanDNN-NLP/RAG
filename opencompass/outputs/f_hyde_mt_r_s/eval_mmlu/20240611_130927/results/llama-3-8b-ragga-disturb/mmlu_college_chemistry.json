A possible mechanism in two elementary steps that explains the rate equation is: In this mechanism the reactive intermediate species is formed in the first step with rate r1 and reacts with CO in the second step with rate r2. If this reaction occurred in a single step, its reaction rate (r) would be proportional to the rate of collisions between and CO molecules: r = k[][CO], where k is the reaction rate constant, and square brackets indicate a molar concentration. therefore be estimated by the steady-state approximation, which specifies that the rate at which it is formed equals the (total) rate at which it is consumed. But the overall rate of reaction is the rate of formation of final product (here ), so that r = r2 ≈ r1. That is, the overall rate is determined by the rate of the first step, and (almost) all molecules that react at the first step continue to the fast second step. with reactants prior to the rate-determining step is described as a pre-equilibrium For the reaction of and CO, this hypothesis can be rejected, since it implies a rate equation that disagrees with experiment. However, some other reactions are believed to involve rapid pre-equilibria prior to the rate-determining step, as shown below.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college chemistry.

An infrared microscope allows samples to be observed and spectra measured from regions as small as 5 microns across. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas. This confers a significant advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time. The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy originates from the fact that a Fourier transform (a mathematical process) is required to convert the raw data into the actual spectrum. The goal of absorption spectroscopy techniques (FTIR, ultraviolet-visible (\"UV-Vis\") spectroscopy, etc.) is to measure how much light a sample absorbs at each wavelength. The most straightforward way to do this, the \"dispersive spectroscopy\" technique, is to shine a monochromatic light beam at a sample, measure how much of the light is absorbed, and repeat for each different wavelength. (This is how some UV–vis spectrometers work, for example.) Rather than shining a monochromatic beam of light (a beam composed of only a single wavelength) at the sample, this technique shines a beam containing many frequencies of light at once\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college chemistry.

In such cases, the mixture can sometimes have a boiling point that is lower than either of the pure components; a mixture with a minimum boiling point is a type of azeotrope. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college chemistry.

A quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the change ΔG (sometimes written \"delta G\" or \"dG\") in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) caused by the reaction. As a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure, ΔG must be smaller than the non-pressure-volume (non-PV, e.g. Such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic, having For a closed system, one may write the first law of thermodynamics as : ΔU = Q – W , where ΔU denotes the change of the system's \n\n The laws of thermodynamics system apply to well-defined systems. Fig.1 is a general representation of a thermodynamic system. In our formulation we assume that heat and mass transfer and volume changes take place only separately at well-defined regions of the system boundary. First, one assumes that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. This is reflected in a negative ΔG, and the reaction is called an exergonic process.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college chemistry.

Two-electron oxidants, such as NaOCl, are able to directly convert nitroxides into oxoammoniums. The other two equivalents of oxoammonium (red) undergo comproportionation to re-form nitroxy radicals (pink). (5)\n\n One-electron oxidation of the nitroxide produces a highly electrophilic oxoammonium species, which serves as the active oxidizing agent. The nitroxide can be used as a catalyst in conjunction with cheaper stoichiometric oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite or bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB). Under neutral or slightly acidic conditions (in the presence of silica gel, for instance), oxidation occurs by an initial hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the oxoammonium nitrogen, followed by concerted proton transfer and hydride abstraction. The mechanism of oxidation under weakly basic (pyridine) conditions is similar, except that pyridine neutralizes the hydroxyammonium species, and this intermediate \"comproportionates\" with oxoammonium salt to give nitroxide \n\nThrough space or dipolar coupling ; Exchange between orthogonal (non-overlapping) orbitals in the same spatial region ; Net moment via antiferromagnetic coupling of non-equal spin centers (ferrimagnetism) The mechanism by which molecule-based magnets stabilize and display a net magnetic moment is different than that present in traditional metal- and ceramic-based magnets.
