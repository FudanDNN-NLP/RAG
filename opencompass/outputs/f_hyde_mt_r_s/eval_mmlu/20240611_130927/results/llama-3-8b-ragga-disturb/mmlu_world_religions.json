The term also refers to any embodiment, manifestation, incarnation, personification, appearance, image, idol or statue of a deity. The earliest mention of the term murti occurs in primary Upanishads composed in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly in verse 3.2 of Aitareya Upanishad, verse 1.13 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, verse 6.14 of Maitrayaniya Upanishad and verse 1.5 of Prashna Upanishad. The section sets out to prove \n\n murti as 'idol' is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it. It may be found inside or outside a temple or home, installed to be moved with a festive procession (utsava murti), or just be a landmark. It is a significant part of Hindu iconography, and is implemented in many ways. Two major categories include: Beyond anthropomorphic forms of religious murti, some traditions of Hinduism cherish aniconism, where alternate symbols are shaped into a murti, such as the linga for Shiva, yoni for Devi, and the saligrama for Vishnu. Murti (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, ISO: Mūrti; ) is a general term for an image, statue or idol of a deity or mortal in Hindu culture. Murti are also found in some nontheistic Jainism traditions, where they serve as symbols of revered mortals inside Jain temples, and are worshiped in murtipujaka rituals. Ancient era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

According to tradition, when Japan suffered a serious epidemic, the Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, suggested that the Emperor Saga personally copy an important Buddhist religious document called the Heart Sutra (Hannya Shingyō). The short-lived temple was officially established in 1236 by Dōgen Zenji, the founder of the Sōtō school of zen in Japan. It was abandoned only seven years later in 1243 when Dōgen and his students left under poorly documented but possibly \n\n Gyōki founded Iwamoto-ji in 729 after receiving an imperial command by Emperor Shōmu who had an interest in establishing a system of provincial temples in Japan.

Kōbō-Daishi arrived at Shimanto Town in 810 and added 5 shrines and 5 temples to the area over a span of 14 years.

Every year there is a programme held at the mosque; Qawwals attend and sing devotional music. The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called Akal Takht and the Jathedar of Akal Takht makes all the important decisions after consultations with the Jathedars of the other four takhts and the SGPC. As such, Sikhs are encouraged to seek the company and holy congregation of sants (Sadh-Sangat), learn from them, and attain \"santhood\" through intensive reading and contemplation of Sikh scripture (gurbani) and Naam Simran. Sikhism advocates for people of all faiths to realize and become one with God, and attaining union with God is the highest form of spiritual enlightenment.
