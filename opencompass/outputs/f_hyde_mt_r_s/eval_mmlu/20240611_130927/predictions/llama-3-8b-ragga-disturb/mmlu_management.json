In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization. Weber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. For example, democratic systems \n\n According to sociologist Max Weber, modern capitalist society \"arose out of the moral calling of Calvinists; more specifically, the doctrine of predestination which resulted in new tensions between the individual and society and encouraged the believer to rationalize the objectivity of his belief (his or her productive contribution to the accumulation of capital).\" \"Weber perceived bureaucratization as an efficient institutional representation of rationality in modern capitalist society, yet also recognized how this could be \"potentially dehumanizing, even malevolent, in its impersonality and possible elevation of economic efficiency and profit-maximization over human values and social justice. Such rationality could potentially strip individuals of their freedom and dignity, placing them, metaphorically, in an 'iron cage' of despair.\" His most important work, La Bureaucratisation du Monde (\"Bureaucratisation of the World\"), was published in Paris in 1939, but most copies were seized by the French government. In it, he stated that Fascism and Stalinism were developing similar political methods. Trotsky thoroughly criticized Rizzi's conflation of Fascism and Stalinism as part of his polemic \"In Defence of Marxism\" which was written to oppose the positions of the Burnham-Shachtman minority in the US Socialist Workers Party.\n\n"
