Capacitive coupling also referred to as electric coupling, makes use of electric fields \n\n As another example from physics, consider a parallel-plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the force acting on the plates. The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C(x) and charge Q is  The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now Q is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same \"pull\" between a capacitor's plates. ΔG equals the maximum amount of non-PV work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of reversible process. If analysis indicates a positive ΔG for a reaction, then energy — in the form of electrical or other non-PV work — would have to be added to the reacting system for ΔG to be smaller than the non-PV work and make it possible for the reaction to occur. One can think of ∆G as the amount of \"free\" or \"useful\" energy available to do work. Many compact cameras charge the flash capacitor immediately after power-up, and some even just by inserting the batteries. Merely inserting the battery into the camera can prime the capacitor to become dangerous or at least unpleasant for up to several days.\n\n"

        "gold": "B",
        "context": " Also with implications for the physical exploration of the Earth's interior is the gravitational field, which is the net effect of gravitation (due to mass attraction) and centrifugal force (due to rotation). It can be measured very accurately at the surface and remotely by satellites. All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s2. In reality, gravitational acceleration (symbol: g) varies slightly with latitude, elevation \n\n The unit of measure of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI) is m/s2. One g is the force per unit mass due to gravity at the Earth's surface and is the standard gravity (symbol: gn), defined as 9.807 metres per second squared, or equivalently 9.807 newtons of force per kilogram of mass. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth, which is its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. The object's weight is less on Mars, where gravity is weaker, and more on Saturn, and \n\nWeight = mass × −g-force The g-force acting on a stationary object resting on the Earth's surface is 1 g (upwards) and results from the resisting reaction of the Earth's surface bearing upwards equal to an acceleration of 1 g, and is equal and opposite to gravity. ; The g-force acting on an object in any weightless environment such as free-fall in a vacuum is 0 g. ; The g-force acting on an object under acceleration can be much greater than 1 g, for example, the dragster pictured at top right can exert\n\n"
