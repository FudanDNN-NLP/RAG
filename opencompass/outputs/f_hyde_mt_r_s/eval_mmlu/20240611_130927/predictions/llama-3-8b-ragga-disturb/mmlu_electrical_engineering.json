ERH is typically more cost effective when used for treating contaminant source areas. As the subsurface is heated the hydrolysis half life of the contaminant will decrease as described by the Arrhenius equation. There are predominantly two electrical load arrangements for ERH: three-phase and six-phase. Six-phase heating consists of six electrodes in a hexagonal pattern with a neutral electrode in the center of the array. In a six-phase heating pattern there can be hot spots and cold spots depending on the phases that are next to each other. For this reason, six-phase heating typically works best on small circular areas that are less than 65 feet in diameter. ERH is \n\n The RMS value of an alternating current is also known as its heating value, as it is a voltage which is equivalent to the direct current value that would be required to get the same heating effect. For example, if 120 V AC RMS is applied to a resistive heating element it would heat up by exactly the same amount as if 120 V DC were applied.\n\n"
