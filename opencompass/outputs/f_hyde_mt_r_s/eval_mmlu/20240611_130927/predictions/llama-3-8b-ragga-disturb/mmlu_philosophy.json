Therefore, Singer argues that we should rely on more sophisticated consequentialist judgements that fit better in our modern times than the deontological judgements that were useful for more rudimentary interactions. ; 4) The composer feels it necessary to reiterate the following \n\n1) Every Action done in Company, ought to be with Some Sign of Respect, to those that are Present. ; 4) In the Presence of Others Sing not to yourself with a humming Noise, nor Drum with your Fingers or Feet. Rules of Civility & Decent Behaviour In Company \n\n consideration of the philosophical arguments presented in Singer's book Animal Liberation failed to see the \"radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees.\" Posner emphasizes the importance of facts over arguments in creating social change. According to him, moral constructivism searches for reasonable grounds whereas deontological judgements rely on hasty and emotional responses. Singer argues our most immediate moral intuitions should be challenged. He gives the example of a brother and sister who secretly decide to have sex with each other using contraceptives. Our first intuitive reaction is a firm condemnation of incest as morally wrong.\n\n"
