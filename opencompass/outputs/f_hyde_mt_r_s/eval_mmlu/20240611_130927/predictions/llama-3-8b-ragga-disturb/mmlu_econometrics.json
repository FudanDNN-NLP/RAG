These metrics are developed by averaging historical returns, which are no guarantee of future results in the short term or long term. But that is not to say any particular portfolio should have that weighting. But that is not to say price volatility is a desirable attribute of any asset. For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, expenses, and taxes is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, expenses, and taxes other than transaction expenses are often outside the control of the investment manager. ; 2) Price changes are less volatile in bull markets and more volatile in bear markets. ; 5) Volatility correlations decay slowly. ; 6) Trading volumes have memory the same way that volatilities do. ; 7) Past price changes are negatively correlated with future volatilities.\n\n"
