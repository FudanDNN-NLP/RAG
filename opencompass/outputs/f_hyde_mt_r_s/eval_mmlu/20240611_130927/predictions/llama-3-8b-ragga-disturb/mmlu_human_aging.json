Adolescent sex is common; most Americans first have \n\n Partners in committed non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a significant other or partner, especially if the individuals are cohabiting. A 2005 study of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, more commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners. Traditionally, a person past \"college age\" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. Coliving appeals particularly to millennials due to rising property prices. Part of the appeal to millennials is due also to a relative reluctance to marry and/or start a family due to cost. Coliving is particularly popular in cities and urban spaces where housing is costly and limited, providing a more affordable and amenity-based alternative to individual apartments.\n\n"
