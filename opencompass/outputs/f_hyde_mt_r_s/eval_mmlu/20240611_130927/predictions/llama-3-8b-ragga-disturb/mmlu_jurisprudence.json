Weber was genuinely alarmed by the prospect that an institutionalized, morally vacuous or pernicious instrumental, and especially, formal, rationality might be used to justify morally questionable ends. Such rationality could potentially strip individuals of their freedom and dignity, placing them, metaphorically, in an 'iron cage' of despair.\" This does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can be gained by \"weighing the various evaluations against one another and making a 'statesman-like' compromise among them\", which is often proposed as a solution by those sharing Weber's kind of methodological perspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls \"syncretism\", is not only impossible but also unethical, for it avoids \"the practical duty to stand up for our own ideals\" [Weber 1904/1949, p. 58 ].
