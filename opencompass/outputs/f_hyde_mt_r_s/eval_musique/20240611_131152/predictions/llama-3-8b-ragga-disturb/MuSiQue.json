As part of this program, the Interim Test Range at Balasore in Odisha was also developed for missile testing. The Agni missile (अग्नि IAST: Agni \"Fire\") is a family of medium to intercontinental range ballistic missiles developed by India, named after one of the five elements of nature. The first missile of the series, Agni-I was developed under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP) and tested in 1989. The family comprises the following:\n\n A technology demonstrator for re-entry technology called Agni was added to IGMDP as Prithvi was unable to be converted to a longer ranged missile. The first flight of Agni with re-entry technology took place in 1989.\n\n"

She became an opponent of the Salazar regime, helping political prisoners and supporting the candidacy of Humberto Delgado. She then created a new weekly publication, O Sol, with the same editorial platform. She subsequently moved the paper's editing and printing operation to Porto, where she stayed for a time.

After the sale of Bergkamp to Internazionale in 1993, Van Gaal re-signed the experienced Frank Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates Frank and Ronald de Boer, Edwin van der Sar, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Michael Reiziger and Winston Bogarde, as well as mercurial foreign talents Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu and Jari Litmanen, and veteran captain Danny Blind.\n\n"

Adams is an American-Canadian academic, author, adventurer, labour rights activist and poet. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he received his B.A. industrial relations theory and human rights in employment, especially on the topic of collective bargaining as a human right. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. Sandford had been popular and widely respected in Lithgow as a relatively benevolent employer, who had the interests of his workers at heart. He had engaged his workers by contract with an element of profit sharing; an arrangement which he advocated and in which he took some personal pride. When the subsequent owners, G & C Hoskins attempted to change these employment arrangements to day labour, it began a series of bitter and sometimes violent strikes and lock outs lasting almost four years. Sandford expressed frustration that he had been forced to set up an iron and steel industry \"without duties or a bonus\"—something he himself saw as an impossibility—and he believed himself to have failed. This and the concern he held for his workforce explained much of the mental anguish that characterised his later years at Lithgow.\n\nQuestion: Who employs the author of \"Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor\"?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he received his B.A. industrial relations theory and human rights in employment, especially on the topic of collective bargaining as a human right. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. Sandford had been popular and widely respected in Lithgow as a relatively benevolent employer, who had the interests of his workers at heart. He had engaged his workers by contract with an element of profit sharing; an arrangement which he advocated and in which he took some personal pride. When the subsequent owners, G & C Hoskins attempted to change these employment arrangements to day labour, it began a series of bitter and sometimes violent strikes and lock outs lasting almost four years. Sandford expressed frustration that he had been forced to set up an iron and steel industry \"without duties or a bonus\"—something he himself saw as an impossibility—and he believed himself to have failed. This and the concern he held for his workforce explained much of the mental anguish that characterised his later years at Lithgow.\n\n"

Gordon was an articulate propagandist and he inflamed the mob with fears of Papism and a return to absolute monarchical rule. The situation deteriorated rapidly, and in 1780, after a meeting of the Protestant Association, its members subsequently marched on the House of Commons to deliver a petition \n\n due to political coalitions and conflicts within the empire, in order to gain candidates as imperial partisans. Many Protestant candidates, elected by the capitulars, neither achieved papal confirmation nor a liege indult, but nevertheless, as a matter of fact held de facto princely power.

Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek's works, Block asserts that: \"in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed\". Although Hayek believed that government intervention in markets would lead to a loss of freedom, he recognized a limited role for government to perform tasks for which he believed free markets were not capable: \"The successful use of competition as the principle of social organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action.\" While Hayek is opposed to regulations that restrict the freedom to enter a trade, or to buy and sell at any price, or to control quantities, he acknowledges the utility \n\n Hayek argues that Western democracies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have \"progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past\". Socialism, while presented as a means of assuring equality, does so through \"restraint \n\n Writing in the era of the Great Depression, the rise of autocracies in Russia, Italy and Germany, and World War II, Hayek wrote a memo to the director of the London School of Economics, William Beveridge, in the early 1930s to dispute the then-popular claim that fascism represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system.\n\n"

As a result of their Champions League win, Bayern qualified to play against Chelsea, the winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, and also earned the right to enter the semi-finals of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative. In the 2014–15 season, despite some lacklustre early season performances, City again reached the knockout stages of the Champions League and at the turn of the year had caught up with Chelsea to be joint first with identical records. Early \n\n After seeing two league championships heading to Dortmund and losing the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final to Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena, Bayern recovered to clinch the 2012–13 Bundesliga in record time, breaking Dortmund's points record which had been set the year before. At the end of that season, the rivals met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The German clubs had eliminated the two Spanish contenders, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, leading to the term \"German Clasico\" term first being used at that time, based on the El Clásico between those two Spanish clubs. The game was also notable for the fact that Dortmund's Mario Götze had already agreed to join Bayern in the coming weeks (although he did not play in the final due to injury).\n\n"

It was widely distributed and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to concurrently spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. ; Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists (1765). This pamphlet expands the author's argument from The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved. John Locke (1632–1704) is often referred to as \"the philosopher of the American Revolution\" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology.

As Diwan the Company took two decisions. The first was that it abolished the village land record office and created a company official called Patwari. The magistrate carried out policing functions through the Darogha who had always been a state functionary under the Faujdar. The government tried to accommodate this class by enacting the Rent Act in 1859. To improve relations between landlord and tenant, a Rent Commission was set up in 1880. By the recommendations and observations of the Rent Commission, the Bengal Legislative Council enacted Act III of 1885 which defined rights and obligations of intermediate tenancies and raiyati tenancies. In 1905, Bengal was partitioned and then the Government of India Act of 1919 and 1935 were enacted. plan was outlined for a \"Free State of Bengal\", echoing the legacy of the name of the Irish Free State. The plan was based on a confessionalist structure with power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. It sought to prevent the division of Bengal on religious grounds. The British government proceeded to partition Bengal in accordance with the Mountbatten Plan and Radcliffe Line. The East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950 was passed by the newly formed Democratic Government of the Dominion of Pakistan for its eastern provinces (East Bengal, present day Bangladesh).\n\n"
