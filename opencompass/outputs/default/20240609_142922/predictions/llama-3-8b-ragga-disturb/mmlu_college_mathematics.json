Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: Let k be the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1], and let n be the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1]. Which of the following is true?\nA. k = 0 and n = 1\nB. k = 1 and n = 0\nC. k = n = 1\nD. k > 1\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
