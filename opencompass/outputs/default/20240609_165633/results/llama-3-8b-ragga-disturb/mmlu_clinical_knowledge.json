Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: What size of cannula would you use in a patient who needed a rapid blood transfusion (as of 2020 medical knowledge)?\nA. 18 gauge.\nB. 20 gauge.\nC. 22 gauge.\nD. 24 gauge.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
