If a is algebraic over K, then K(a), the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: K(a) is an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is not true.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
