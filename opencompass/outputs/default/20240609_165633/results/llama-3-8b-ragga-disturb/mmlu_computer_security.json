L 0←] for each do if largest item\n i +,) consists of \"sum + i w and \"int0 because those are the prior statements that can affect the value at \"sum = sum + i w\".\n\n,( sum i) only =  < and(,) only contains the statement \"int w = 7\".\n\nThis also means that the programmer need not worry about running out of stack or heap space for extremely deep recursions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about computer security. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
