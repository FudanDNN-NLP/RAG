Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\nA. directional selection.\nB. stabilizing selection.\nC. sexual selection.\nD. disruptive selection.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "prediction": "The correct answer is A. Directional Selection.\n\nExplanation:\n\nDirectional selection occurs when there is a consistent advantage for one extreme phenotype over the other. In this case, the environmental change favors individuals that are taller, which means that the trait of height",
