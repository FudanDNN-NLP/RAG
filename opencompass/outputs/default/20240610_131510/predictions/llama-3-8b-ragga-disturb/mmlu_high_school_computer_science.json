The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\nB. The program can also be expressed as binary code, which will reduce the likelihood of errors.\nC. The program cannot be expressed as binary code, because binary code can only be used to represent data.\nD.
