Deutschland über alles. Germany above everything! … There you have the ultimate framework of an old but childish race.\nGeorges Clemenceau, Grandeur and Misery of Victory, 1930\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Clemenceau believed\nA. that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland über alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were the reason Germany started the war\nB. that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland über alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude\nC. that the reason Germany lost the war was that it was betrayed from within\nD. that Germany provided the ultimate framework for modern warfare\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.\nLeeds Woolen Workers Petition, 1786\nThis document can be used as evidence for\nA. the spread of revolutionary ideas among the British working class in the eighteenth century\nB. the rise of the Luddite movement in Britain in the eighteenth century\nC. the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century\nD. an increase in the use of child labor in eighteenth-century Britain\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\némile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB.
