Considering the scale of the size of the molecules of the fluids, which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\nA. The high temperature water will rise to the top of the container until it has cooled and then mixes with the alcohol.\nB. The molecules of the water continue to have a higher kinetic energy than the molecules of the alcohol, but the two liquids mix until the energy is spread evenly throughout the container.\nC. The hot water produces thermal radiation that is absorbed by the cold alcohol until the kinetic energy of all the molecules is the same.\nD. The water molecules collide with the alcohol molecules, transferring energy until the average kinetic energy of both the water and alcohol molecules are the same.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
