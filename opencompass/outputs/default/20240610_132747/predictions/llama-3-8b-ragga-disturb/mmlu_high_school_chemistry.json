All other hydrogen halides (represented by HX, where X is any other halogen) are gases at the same temperature. Why?\nA. Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.\nB. HF is smaller than any other H-X molecule; therefore it exhibits stronger London dispersion forces.\nC. The dipoles in a HF molecule exhibit a particularly strong attraction force to the dipoles in other HF molecules.\nD. The H-F bond is the most ionic in character compared to all other hydrogen halides.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
