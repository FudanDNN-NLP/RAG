From this it can be inferred that\nA. inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\nB. the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\nC. aggregate supply decreased.\nD. aggregate demand is steeply sloped.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "prediction": "B. The economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level, it suggests that the economy initially had some unused capacity or unemployed resources.
