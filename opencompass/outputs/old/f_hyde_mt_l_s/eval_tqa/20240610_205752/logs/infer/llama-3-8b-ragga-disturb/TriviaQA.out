You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`.

['The man behind The Chipmunks was Ross Bagdasarian, Sr., a singer, songwriter, and producer who was born in 1919 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Bagdasarian attended the University of Southern California, where he studied music and engineering. After graduating, he worked as a radio announcer and disc jockey before starting his own record label, called Original Sound.\n\nIn 1958, Bagdasarian created The Chipmunks, a singing group consisting of four chipmunks: Alvin, Simon, Theodore, and David Seville (Bagdasarian\'s stage name). The group\'s first hit was "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don\'t Be Late)," which reached number one on the Billboard charts in 1958. The song was a novelty hit, featuring the Chipmunks singing a sped-up version of "Alouette," a French folk song.\n\nThe Chipmunks went on to have several more hits, including "Megan," "Pizza Pizza," and "The Twelve Days of Christmas." The group\'s popularity led to a television series, a feature film, and a Broadway musical.\n\nBagdasarian continued to produce music under the Original Sound label, which he sold to Warner Bros. in 1963. He also produced music for', 'Who was the man behind The Chipmunks?']

  A Very Merry Chipmunk is a 1994 music album by Alvin and the Chipmunks, released by Sony Wonder. It is their fourth Christmas album. The album reached #147 on the Billboard 200. It was the first in a series of 25 Christmas compilation albums put forth by Turner Broadcasting company. The fact that it appeared on the Billboard 200, caused Sony to print 5,000 more copies, resulting in a sudden decline in pricing. Wal-Mart put a special on it for 97 cents shortly after Christmas 1994.

 In the scene where The Chipettes are making breakfast for Dave, there's a shot where Jeanette slips and gets eggs all over the newspaper that is lying on Brittany's head. But in the next shot, Brittany is covered in eggs. ; This was the first appearance of the Chipmunks' long lost mother Vinny. She made her second and final appearance in a season six episode of the original Chipmunks series titled "Vinny's Visit" (the sequel to the special in episode form). By that point, the show was now simply called The Chipmunks, and was now being co-produced by DiC Entertainment (that episode was not included on the series' syndication package, and has never been released on home video). ; Dave says that he celebrates the Chipmunks' birthday in the spring when he found them abandoned on his doorstep, but Vinny says she abandoned them during the winter.

Because, with Chris being on it, people were saying that they didn't wanna support the track before they'd even HEARD it! Which meant I really had to engage myself and find the inner strength to say 'Yo, I'm gonna go with this track REGARDLESS! Because I know what this song means to ME, I know that it means to CHRIS - and if it's from the heart then it can't go WRONG!'!"

['After the resignation of Arthur Balfour in 1905, the next British Prime Minister was H. H. Asquith. He was a member of the Liberal Party and served as Prime Minister from 1908 to 1914. Asquith\'s government was characterized by social reforms, including the introduction of old-age pensions and the establishment of a national health insurance system. However, his administration was also marked by political turmoil, including the House of Lords\' rejection of the Parliament Act 1911, which led to a constitutional crisis. Asquith\'s government ultimately collapsed in 1914 due to the outbreak of World War I.\n"""', 'Who was the next British Prime Minister after Arthur Balfour?']

  Salisbury was back in office, although without a conservative majority; he depended on the Liberal Unionists, led by Lord Hartington. Maintaining the alliance forced Salisbury to make concessions in support of progressive legislation regarding Irish land purchases, education, and county councils. His nephew Arthur Balfour acquired a strong reputation for resolute coercion in Ireland, and was promoted to leadership in the Commons in 1891. The Prime Minister proved adept at his handling of the press, as Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted in his diary in 1887 he was: "the prime minister most accessible to the press. He is not prone to give information: but when he does, he gives it freely, & his information can always be relied on."

Although unable to accomplish much due to his lack of a parliamentary majority, the split of the Liberals over Irish Home Rule in 1886 enabled him to return to power with a majority, and, excepting a Liberal minority government (1892–95), to serve as prime minister from 1886 to 1902.

He remained as prime minister until Gladstone's Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish nationalists at the 1892 general election. The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900. He relinquished the premiership to his nephew Arthur Balfour in 1902 and died in 1903. He was the last prime minister to serve from the House of Lords.

  Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, (7 June 1770 – 4 December 1828) was a British Tory statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1827. He held many important cabinet offices such as Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. He was also a member of the House of Lords and served as leader. As prime minister, Liverpool called for repressive measures at domestic level to maintain order after the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. He dealt smoothly with the Prince Regent when King George III was incapacitated. He also steered the country through the period

  On 21 June 1895, the government lost a vote in committee on army supply by just seven votes. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Rosebery remained the Liberal leader for another year, then permanently retired from politics.

  When the Macdonald government fell due to the Pacific Scandal in 1873, the Governor General, Lord Dufferin, called upon Mackenzie, who had been chosen as the leader of the Liberal Party a few months earlier, to form a new government. Mackenzie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an election for January 1874. The Liberals won a majority of the seats in the House of Commons having garnered 40% of the popular vote. Mackenzie remained prime minister until the 1878 election when Macdonald's Conservatives returned to power with a majority government. For a man of Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a position was unusual in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to

  Labour won more seats (though fewer votes) than the Conservative Party in the general election in February 1974, which resulted in a hung parliament. As Heath was unable to persuade the Liberals to form a coalition, Wilson returned to 10 Downing Street on 4 March 1974 as prime minister of a minority Labour Government. He gained a three-seat majority in another election later that year, on 10 October 1974. One of the key issues addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on British membership of the European Community (EC) which took place in June 1975: Labour had pledged in its February 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and then to consult the public in a referendum on whether Britain should stay in on the new terms. Although the government recommended a vote in favour of continued membership, the cabinet was split on the issue, and Ministers were allowed to campaign on different sides of the question. The referendum resulted in a near two-to-one majority in favour of Britain remaining in the EC.

  In 1978, Exile consisted of Stokley, Pennington, and Cornelison, plus second keyboardist Marlon Hargis, bassist Sonny LeMaire, and drummer Steve Goetzman. This lineup signed with Warner Brothers and released the album Mixed Emotions. The disco-influenced single "Kiss You All Over", written by the album's producer Mike Chapman and his songwriting partner Nicky Chinn, topped the American singles chart for four weeks and also reached the top ten in a dozen European countries. The song attracted some controversy for its risqué lyrics, while Stokley gained media attention as a flamboyant and charismatic frontman. The success of "Kiss You All Over" resulted in invitations for Exile to tour with Heart, Aerosmith, Fleetwood Mac, and other leading rock acts of the period. The follow-up album All There Is yielded the minor hit single "The Part of Me That Needs You Most", which reached the top ten in South Africa and New Zealand in 1979.

In addition to that, he also announced that he were to be recording the last Wham! single with Andrew Ridgeley the following week in Los Angeles. As it turned out, he revealed to journalist Paula Yates on The Tube that he was recording four tracks, two of which - "Where Did Your Heart Go" and "The Edge of Heaven" - had been previously played on the Whamamerica! tour and the other two being new tracks he was experimenting with. This was prior to the filming of the video for Michael's then-forthcoming solo single, "A Different Corner". Michael was planning to release three of the tracks as part of a Wham! EP, but wasn't sure which one of the songs was going to be the main single at that point - all of these would appear on "The Final". As of 12 March 1986, the album and single had been completed and ready for release under the Wham! name.

"Middle of the Night" had already appeared on the group's Greatest Hits compilation released some months earlier and was the only single to chart.

The style of the album was in the group's familiar pop mould, but with a shift towards more lightweight themes. The single "Goodbye Goodbye" was a more sombre affair and its failure in the charts led to the next two singles being aimed more at the children's market. "Papa Louis"

   Paul Ferrier (29 March 1843 - September 1920) was a French dramatist, who also provided libretti for several composers, especially Varney and Serpette. Ferrier was born in Montpellier. He had already produced several comedies when in 1873 he secured real success with two short pieces, Chez l'avocat and Les Incendies de Massoulard. Others of his numerous plays are Les Compensations (1876); L'Art de tramper les femmes (1890), with Émile de Najac. One of Ferrier's biggest successes was the production with Fabrice Carré of Josephine vendue par ses sœurs (1886), an opera bouffée with music by Victor Roger. His opera libretti include La Marocaine (1879), music of Jacques Offenbach; Le Chevalier d'Harmental (1896) after the play of Alexandre Dumas, père, for the music of André Messager; La Fille de Tabarin (1901), with Victorien Sardou, music of Gabriel Pierné. Ferrier died in Nouan-le-Fuzelier (Loir-et-Cher), at age 77.

She also appeared in revivals of Little Jack Sheppard, Cinder Ellen up too Late and Carmen up to Data. Verner joined a Gaiety burlesque company on a tour of South Africa where she died suddenly at Adelaide in August 1892. Edwardes and Gaiety Theatre performer Fred Leslie raised £100 to support her six children and her "long incapacitated" widower, George Potier. He nevertheless remarried a much younger wife in 1898 and with her had four more children before his death in 1908.

On 8 October 1857, at St. George's, Hanover Square, she married William Avery Bushnell. He soon fell into ill-health, and died at Biarritz, France, on 2 July 1858, aged 35. She appeared at Jullien's promenade concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857, when her ballad singing, the branch of art in which lay her greatest power, was much applauded. After her husband's death she took part in concerts in London and the country towns.

She also gradually gained some stage and drama experience in small local theatrical productions, and Gilbert and Sullivan; but in Massachusetts in the thirties and forties, there were few opportunities for young performers to try their hand at serious, fully staged opera.

  Nobody Does It Like Me is a 1974 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey's recordings had been selling well since 1970, scoring three top ten singles and three ten top albums. Nobody Does It Like Me was recorded with a new producer, George Butler, and brought a partial return to the traditional pop sound of Bassey's pre-1970s career. Here, the title track "Nobody Does It Like Me" and "When You Smile" harken back to the big band era. Bassey's soaring vocals on Paul Anka's "I'm Not Anyone" and the slightly funky "Morning in Your Eyes" contrast with a delicately rendered "Davy". The duet "Davy", recorded with the song's composer

As the opening credits roll, wealthy Houstonian Daphne Heap (Margaret Hamilton) begins to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" on the field of the Astrodome, but stops the band, insisting that it's off-key. The band and Daphne start again, while the credits begin again as well.

This figure is based on the results of the 2016 Census, which was conducted in August of that year. The population has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, with a growth rate of around 1.5% per year. The majority of the population is concentrated in the eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, with the largest city being Sydney. However, there has been a trend towards population growth in Western Australia and the Northern Territory in recent years.

Melbourne dominated Australia's population growth for the 15th year in a row as of 2017, adding 125,424 people between 2016 and 2017, and boomed past 5 million people in 2019.

Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia. Melbourne is home to residents from 200 countries and territories, who speak over 233 languages and dialects and follow 116 religious faiths. The earliest known inhabitants of the broad area that later became known as Melbourne were Indigenous Australians – specifically, at the time of European settlement, the Bunurong, Wurundjeri and Wathaurong tribal groups. Melbourne is still a centre of Aboriginal life — consisting of local groups and indigenous groups from other parts of Australia, as most indigenous Victorians were displaced from their traditional lands during colonization – with the Aboriginal community in the city numbering over 20,000 persons (0.6% of the population).

Melbourne dominated Australia's population growth for the 15th year in a row as of 2017, adding 125,424 people between 2016 and 2017, and boomed past 5 million people in 2019. Population growth is however projected to significantly decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic slowdown. Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia. Melbourne is home to residents from 200 countries and territories, who speak over 233 languages and dialects and follow 116 religious faiths. The earliest known inhabitants of the broad area that later became known as Melbourne were Indigenous Australians – specifically, at the time of European settlement, the Bunurong, Wurundjeri and Wathaurong tribal groups. Melbourne is still a centre of Aboriginal life — consisting of local groups and indigenous groups from other parts of Australia, as most indigenous Victorians were displaced from their traditional lands during colonization – with the Aboriginal community in the city numbering over 20,000 persons (0.6% of the population).

Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. Unusual among Australian cities, it is an entirely planned city. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory at the northern tip of the Australian Alps, the country's highest mountain range. As of June 2020, Canberra's estimated population was 431,380. The area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for up to 21,000 years, with the principal group being the Ngunnawal

["The 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on December 5, 1933, repealed the 18th Amendment, which had banned the production, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. The 21st Amendment also gave states the power to regulate the sale and distribution of alcohol.\n\nAfter the repeal of Prohibition, some states continued to enforce strict alcohol laws. In fact, it wasn't until 1966 that the last US state, Mississippi, reintroduced alcohol.\n\nThe Mississippi State Legislature passed a bill that year allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores and liquor stores. The bill also allowed for the establishment of liquor-by-the-drink establishments, such as bars and restaurants.\n\nThe passage of this bill was a significant moment in Mississippi's history. For decades, Mississippi had been one of the most conservative states in the country when it came to alcohol. The state had been dry since 1907, and the sale of alcohol was strictly prohibited.\n\nThe decision to reintroduce alcohol was not without controversy. Many religious leaders and conservative politicians opposed the move, arguing that it would lead to increased crime and social problems.\n\nHowever, supporters of the bill argued that it would provide a much-needed boost to the state's economy. They pointed", 'What was the last US state to reintroduce alcohol after prohibition?']

  American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. During the nineteenth century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. A movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the temperance movement, emerged in the late-nineteenth century. Several American Protestant religious groups, as well as women's groups such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union, supported the movement. In 1919, prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall, banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs which trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition was repealed in 1931. States and localities retained the

  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, saloons across America were often tied houses, with breweries having exclusive contracts with drinking establishments, including helping business start-ups. Competition was fierce among competing breweries' tied houses within cities. This system ended with the enactment of nationwide Prohibition in the United States in 1919. Although Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the states broad power to regulate the alcoholic beverage industry. Tied-house restrictions have been construed as forbidding virtually any form of vertical integration in the alcoholic beverage industry. As the Supreme Court of California

  that stores selling alcohol are open. They feel that this contributes to their lower numbers of alcohol-related problems. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. In 1985, South Dakota challenged the NMDAA, but in 1987 the Supreme Court ruled the Act was constitutional for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, the Court indicated that the States still had the right to set

  to remain "dry", and to this day, a handful still do. During the Vietnam War era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an eighteen-year-old could be drafted into the military to fight in a war overseas, but could not buy a beer. Most states lowered the legal drinking age to eighteen. Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough drunk driving laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. A "Just Say No to Drugs" movement replaced the more libertine ethos of the 1960s.

Polls of candidates for Congress showed that at least 80 percent of them supported repeal of the 18th Amendment. Rep. John W.

   Moonshine historically referred to "clear, unaged whiskey", once made with barley in Scotland and Ireland or corn mash in the United States, though sugar became just as common in illicit liquor during the last century. The word originated in the British Isles as a result of excise laws, but only became meaningful in the United States after a tax passed during the Civil War outlawing non-registered stills. Illegal distilling accelerated during the Prohibition era (1920-1933) which mandated a total ban on alcohol production under the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Since the amendment's repeal in 1933, laws focus on evasion of taxation on any type of spirits or intoxicating liquors. Applicable laws were historically enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of the US Department of Justice, but are now usually handled by state agencies. Enforcement agents were once known colloquially as "revenuers".

  Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents.

She next found a role as an aspiring ballerina who performs with a dance troupe in Dance, Girl, Dance (1940). She considered it to have been a physically demanding film, and felt intimidated by Lucille Ball during the production as she had been a former Ziegfeld and Goldwyn girl and was a superior dancer.

Later, she had a role in Richard Wallace's The Fallen Sparrow opposite John Garfield, whom she described as "my shortest leading man, an outspoken Communist and a real sweetheart". Malone notes though that despite them getting on very well, Garfield did not rate her as an actress. He considers This Land is Mine and The Fallen Sparrow to have been two important pictures in O'Hara's career, "adding to her growing prestige in the film industry", helping her "crawl out from the gimcrack melodrama of adventure films".

During World War II, she contributed her time and talent to the war effort as a theater performer. She toured with theater troupes in Europe both before and after the war. In December, 1945, she appeared at the Majestic Theatre for two readings of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex with classics scholar Eugene O'Neill, Jr. Yurka was active in theater causes all her life. She supported the 1919 actors' strike. She later vigorously defended the interests of American actors against a British invasion of American theaters.

During that time she changed the spelling of her name to "Chele Graham" but kept the pronunciation the same as Shelley Graham. When performance offers dwindled, she worked in theater production as a choreographer, director, and lighting technician in a number of musicals, which led to the underground film scene. "'I took the role very seriously. I was doing Hedda Gabler here! The fact that there was hard-core sex involved was incidental as far as I was concerned. I was totally deluded. I had made myself believe that I was an actress. I was showing true life as it really was, including actual sex as it really happened, instead of the phony stuff that you got from Hollywood. That was my raison d'etre throughout the whole thing. It was okay; I was okay; I wasn't a slut.' (on Devil in Miss Jones) - Georgina Spelvin"

For this index, where 0 represents full equality and 1 is total inequality, Japan places at 0.116. The Gender Inequality Index confirms that Japan has room for improvement. The country still lacks female voices in parliament, compared to similar Asian countries: Japan ranks as fourth lowest within the 51 highest developed countries. In terms of women in the labor force, Japan has the sixth lowest score. However, Japan ranks fairly well when it comes to adolescent birth rate and the percentage of the female population with some secondary education.

  In Japan, the 2019 4th quarter GDP shrank 7.1% from the previous quarter due to two main factors. One is the government's raise in consumption tax from 8% to 10% despite opposition from the citizens. The other is the devastating effects of Typhoon Hagibis, also known as the Reiwa1 East Japan Typhoon (令和元年東日本台風, Reiwa Gannen Higashi-Nihon Taifū), or Typhoon Number 19 (台風19). The 38th depression, 9th typhoon and 3rd super typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, it was the strongest typhoon in decades to strike mainland Japan, and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded at a peak diameter of 825 nautical miles (950 mi; 1529 km). It was also the costliest Pacific typhoon on record, surpassing Typhoon Mireille's record by more than US$5 billion (when not adjusted for inflation).

  The American entertainer Michael Jackson (1958–2009) debuted on the professional music scene at age five as a member of The Jackson 5 and began a solo career in 1971 while still part of the group. Jackson promoted seven of his solo albums with music videos or, as he would refer to them, "short films". Some of them drew criticism for their violent and sexual elements; others were lauded by critics and awarded Guinness World Records for their length, success, and cost. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular culture and the first African-American entertainer to have a strong crossover fanbase on MTV. The popularity of his

  Gone Too Soon is a documentary film about the final year of Michael Jackson's life and career. It first aired on the TV Guide Network on June 25, 2010, exactly one year after Jackson's death. The documentary was produced and directed by author-filmmaker Ian Halperin, who wrote "Unmasked: The Final Years of Michael Jackson", which hit No. 1 the New York Times' bestsellers list in 2009, after he spent five years investigating Jackson. In an interview with Halperin in March 2010, he revealed that the film is culled from 300 hours of footage shot inside the singer's camp and includes video and audio of Jackson shot before his death. It also includes interviews with Jackson's personal manager, trainer, and attorney. According to the filmmakers, Jackson family members were not involved but are aware of the film. Former family attorney Brian Oxman is among the interviewees. The movie is claimed to depict the more scandalous aspects of Jackson's life.

  After nine years of inactivity, Jackson signed to MJJ Music in 1997, a label operated by her brother Michael. She received a major boost from Michael, who assisted in the production of the album, and provided backing vocals on the track "Fly Away," which Michael had previously recorded for himself in 1987 for his album Bad, but it did not make the final cut. The album featured a number of producers some of whom included Eliot Kennedy, Bryan Loren, Keith Thomas, Antonina Armato and brother Michael Jackson.

['The first stereo records went on sale in the 1950s, but it wasn\'t until the 1960s that they became popular. Stereo technology had been around since the 1930s, but it wasn\'t until the 1950s that it became commercially viable. The first stereo records were released by RCA Victor in 1957, and they were quickly followed by releases from other major labels. However, it wasn\'t until the Beatles\' "Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band" was released in 1967 that stereo records truly became a cultural phenomenon. The album\'s innovative use of stereo sound helped to popularize the format and cement its place in music history. Today, stereo records are still popular among audiophiles and collectors, and they continue to be a beloved format for many music lovers.', 'In which decade did stereo records first go on sale?']

When volume 1 was published in late 1960, the majority of classical records issued were monaural. The authors were supportive of the new stereophonic recordings. Their first sentence stated “Let us begin by stating, unequivocally that good stereo on quite modest equipment is infinitely superior, domestically, to any other form of sound reproduction”.

  RCA Victrola was a budget record label introduced by RCA Victor in the early 1960s to reissue classical recordings originally released on the RCA Victor "Red Seal" label. The name "Victrola" came from the early console phonographs first marketed by the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1906. Many of RCA Victrola's reissues included recordings from the historic RCA Victor "Living Stereo" series first released in 1958, using triple channel stereophonic tapes from as early as 1954. There were also some first stereo releases of recordings that had previously been available only in monaural versions. For several years, Victrola released both stereophonic and monaural versions of many albums.

The set, which features the first official stereo versions of a number of tracks on CD, was released in late 2004. The CDs were mastered from submaster tapes from the Capitol Records vaults which were prepared by Capitol A&R executive Dave Dexter Jr., who added reverb to several tracks and simulated stereo ("fake stereo") on mono tracks. The box set debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart on 4 December 2004 at number 35 with sales of 37,303 copies. It spent 6 weeks on the chart.

The Beatles were dissatisfied with how Capitol and other companies around the world were issuing their work in almost unrecognizable forms, so they gained full approval rights beginning in 1967 concerning album titles and cover art, track listing and running order in the United States; their albums were released unmodified starting with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Capitol stopped the production of the US versions in the late 1980s, and the original UK LPs were released in the US beginning in 1987.

  United Kingdom, rare 78–rpms were traded, usually American rock and roll, musicians and record labels such as Little Richard Chuck Berry, and Sun Records. Labels such as London-American (now London Records), RCA Victor and Capitol were priced at a premium. One of the earliest UK record collectors was Mike Adams, who was first known for trading in 1958 on Merseyside. He later became a DJ on the BBC and broadcast on collecting records for many years. He wrote several books on collecting including Apple Beatle Collectables. In the UK, labels considered collectible, such as Atlantic Records, Sun Records, Motown, and Parlophone (EMI), turned into mainstream major record labels later on in the 1960s. In the US, New York's Times Square store is widely acknowledged for feeding the doowop revival of the early sixties, attention focusing on them from 1959.

['Ben Hogan, the legendary golfer, was known for his meticulous approach to the game. He was a five-time winner of the U.S. Open and a two-time winner of the British Open, and his name is synonymous with excellence in golf.\n\nOne day, a young golfer approached Hogan and asked him for advice on how to improve his game. Hogan listened intently as the young man explained his struggles and asked for guidance.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Hogan replied, "Practice."\n\nThe young golfer was taken aback. He had expected a more detailed answer, perhaps some specific drills or exercises. But Hogan\'s response was simple, yet profound.\n\nHogan went on to explain that the key to improving one\'s golf game is to practice consistently and with purpose. He emphasized the importance of repetition and the need to focus on specific aspects of one\'s swing, such as grip, stance, and follow-through.\n\nHogan\'s advice was not just limited to golf. He believed that the same principles applied to any pursuit, whether it be business, art, or any other endeavor.\n\nIn his book, "Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf," Hogan wrote, "The only way to learn anything is by doing it. The only way to improve is by doing it better."\n', "What was golfing great Ben Hogan's famous reply when he was asked how to improve one's game?"]

Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that the first time he saw an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, "[Hurdzan] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell."

Along with Gary Player, David Graham, Hale Irwin and Justin Rose, Langer is one of only five players to have won official tournaments on all six continents on which golf is played.

Langer has battled the yips, having a strong tendency to flinch or twitch during putting. He has changed his putter grip numerous times in an attempt to cure the problem. In the 1991 Ryder Cup, Langer missed a five-foot putt that would have tied the Ryder Cup

There are wild tales of George putting with a rake, a shovel, a pool cue or a broom handle and defeating an opponent who was using a legitimate club. There are stories of George kicking a ball with his foot and acing five out of nine holes in one round on the practice green.

He finished fourth in the British Open on three separate occasions. In 1933, he won the Canadian Open. He was apparently the first-ever golfer to tee off from the howdah atop a domesticated elephant, which he first did (and was photographed doing) at Royal Calcutta Golf Club in Calcutta in 1937, and soon after in other clubs in India, and later in Africa.

The 1928 Olympics were the first to be held in continental Europe, and the first to be held in a country that was not a former British Empire colony.\n\nThe 1928 Olympics were also the first to use electric timing devices and a public-address system. The Olympic flame was used for the first time, and the Olympic Village was used for the first time. The 1928 Olympics were also the first to be broadcast on radio.\n\nThe 1928 Olympics featured 130 events in 17 sports. The United States topped the medal table with 41 gold medals, 29 silver medals, and 28 bronze medals. The Netherlands finished second with 18 gold medals, 15 silver medals, and 14 bronze medals.\n\nThe 1928 Olympics were also notable for the introduction of the 100-meter hurdles for women, which was won by Betty Cuthbert of Australia.

["The site of a boxing match is called a ring, but it's actually a square. This is because the ring is designed to be a square with ropes around the edges to prevent the boxers from falling out of the ring during the match. The corners of the ring are padded to protect the boxers from injury if they fall or are knocked down. The ring is typically made of canvas or vinyl and is raised off the ground to provide better visibility for the audience. The ring is also surrounded by a mat, which is used to cushion the boxers' falls and prevent them from getting hurt if they fall outside the ring. The ring is typically 16 feet by 16 feet, with a height of 3 feet 3 inches. The ring is also surrounded by a canvas apron, which is used to protect the boxers' feet and prevent them from slipping on the mat. The apron is typically 12 inches wide and is secured to the mat with ropes. The ring is also equipped with a canvas cover, which is used to protect the mat from wear and tear. The cover is typically made of canvas or vinyl and is secured to the mat with ropes. The ring is also equipped with a center ring post, which is used to hold the ropes and provide support for the ring.

  The field for the competition was a square measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, which could be constructed by teams for practising prior to competitions. In the centre of the field there is a vertically constructed set of pegs, which are arranged in a three-by-three grid (as a tic-tac-toe board). Along the edges of the field, there are other pegs, each of which contains a set of six red or blue rings, which can be harvested and scored by the corresponding alliance. The field is also divided into two triangular sides, one red and one blue.

  Controversy surrounded the new judging system in boxing; the new system counts has five judges who judge each bout, and a computer randomly selects three whose scores are counted. Traditionally, judges would use a computer scoring system to count each punch landed, but in 2016 the winner of each round was awarded 10 points and the loser a lower number, based on criteria which includes the quality of punches landed, effective aggression and tactical superiority. Two results in particular attracted controversy (both involving Russian athletes whose victories were put in question): the defeat of Vasily Levit by Russian Evgeny Tishchenko in the men's heavyweight gold-medal fight, drawing jeers from the audience, and the defeat of Michael Conlan by Russian Vladimir Nikitin in

  A standing eight count, also known as a protection count, is a boxing judgment call made by a referee during a bout. When invoked, the referee stops the action and counts to eight. During that time the referee will determine if the boxer can continue. When the count reaches eight, the referee often moves back two steps and instructs the boxer to walk towards them and hold their arms out. This helps the referee determine if the boxer is functioning and alert enough to continue. If the boxer is unsteady on his feet, or seems unable to focus on the referee, the bout is ended on

['The first Boston Marathon was held on April 19, 1897. The race was organized by a group of runners, led by John Graham, who were members of the Boston Athletic Association. The idea for the marathon came from the success of the first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. The marathon race in the Olympics was a 24.85-mile (40-kilometer) run from the town of Marathon to Athens. The Boston Marathon was modeled after this race, and the course was designed to be as similar as possible to the Olympic course.\n\nThe first Boston Marathon was a small affair, with only 15 runners competing. The race started at 1:00 p.m. on a Monday, and the runners started in the town of Ashland, about 24 miles (38 kilometers) from Boston. The course was hilly and challenging, with several steep inclines and declines. The runners had to contend with muddy roads and strong winds, and some of them even had to stop to help a fellow runner who had fallen ill.\n\nDespite the difficult conditions, the race was a success. The winner, John J. McDermott, completed the course in 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 10 seconds. He was followed closely', 'In the very first Boston Marathon, 15 runners competed. How many finished?']

  The first marathon was perhaps a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. According to this belief, he dropped dead of exhaustion shorty after arriving in Athens. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. After around 40 years of various distances, the 42.195 kilometer (26.2) mile trek became standard. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. With an increase in popularity, the scientific field has a large basis to analyze some of the physiological characteristics and the factors influencing these traits that led to Pheidippides's death. The high physical and biochemical demands of marathon running and variation across finishing times make for an intricate field of study that entangles multiple facets of human capacities.

['The highest mountain in Africa is not Mount Kilimanjaro, as many people believe. While Kilimanjaro is the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, it is not the highest mountain in Africa. That title belongs to Mount Kenya, which is located in Tanzania.\n\nMount Kenya, also known as Kirinyaga, is a dormant volcano that rises to an elevation of 5,199 meters (16,726 feet) above sea level. It is the second-highest mountain in Africa, after Kilimanjaro, and the highest mountain in Kenya.\n\nThe mountain is located in the Great Rift Valley, which is a geological feature that runs through East Africa. The rift valley is a result of the tectonic activity that has been occurring in the region for millions of years.\n\nMount Kenya is a popular destination for hikers and climbers, with several routes leading to the summit. The most popular route is the Sirimon Route, which is a 5-7 day trek that starts at an elevation of 2,300 meters (7,546 feet) and ends at the summit.\n\nThe mountain is also home to several indigenous communities, including the Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru people. These communities have lived in the region for centuries and have a deep cultural and spiritual connection to', 'Which volcano in Tanzania is the highest mountain in Africa?']

  Furtwängler, who along with Ziegfried Koenig, were the fourth to ascend to the summit of Kilimanjaro in 1912.  At the summit, there is a sign posted by the Tanzanian government. The sign (printed in English only) reads "Congratulations! You are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania, 5,895 m. AMSL. Africa's Highest Point. World's Highest Free-Standing Mountain." It formerly had a fourth part of the sign, which read, "One of World's Largest Volcanos. Welcome." The sign is covered in travel stickers from past trekkers who have left their mark on the top of the peak. Near this sign is a box containing a log that many trekkers have signed.

Descend to Kibo Hut and then down to the thicker air and relative warmth of Horombo hut. ; 6) Descend to Marangu gate.  The Marangu Route (also known as the "Coca-Cola" route) is the easiest ascent of Kilimanjaro, although any ascent can be challenging. Climbs can be done over 6 days. It crosses The Saddle, a 5 km wide, high-altitude, semi-desert that separates craggy Mawenzi from the main summit Kibo.

  There are several routes by which to reach Kibo, or Uhuru Peak, the highest summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, namely: Marangu, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame. Being one of the most popular mountains in the world, roughly 50,000 trekkers every year try to reach the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro. According to research published by the Climb Kilimanjaro Guide, the average summit success rate across all climbers and routes is 65%. However, summit success rate heavily depends upon what route is climbed as routes vary considerably in terms of acclimatization profile and duration of climb.

  The highlands comprise a group of plateaus and volcanic mountains, including the Mbeya Mountains, Poroto Mountains, Kipengere Range, Mount Rungwe, Kitulo Plateau, Umalila Mountains, and Matengo Highlands. The Ufipa Plateau extends northwest, between Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa. The eastern and western branches of the East African Rift converge in the highlands, and the Western Rift continues south as the valley of Lake Malawi. To the northeast, the Makambako Gap separates the Southern Highlands from the Eastern Arc Mountains. Mt. Rungwe (2,960 metres), and Mtorwe (2961 m) in the Kipengere Range, are the highest peaks in the highlands. Other peaks include Chaluhangi (2933 m) and Ishinga (2688 m) in the Kipengere Range, Ngozi (2621 m) in the Poroto Mountains, and Mbeya (2826 m), Loloza (2656 m), and Pungulomo (2273 m) in the Mbeya Mountains.

  Mount Kenya and Nyeri hill are nearby, as well as the Tetu hills 50 km to the North East. About 20 km from the city is Mount Kenya National Park. Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano lying astride the Equator. The mountain has two main snow-covered peaks – Batian (5 200 m) and Nelion (5 188 m). It is the highest mountain in the country and the second, after Kilimanjaro, in Africa. The mountain slopes are covered in forest, bamboo, scrub and moorland giving way on high central peaks to rock, ice and snow. Its U-shaped glacial valleys, rugged snow-capped peaks, Afro-alpine desert, thirty lakes and eight different natural forest types and a variety of wildlife species make it a convergence of natural attractions. The wildlife found in the park include giant forest hog, tree hyrax, white-tailed mongoose, black leopard, mountain bongo, elephant, black rhino, suni, black-fronted duiker, mole-rat and over 130 species of birds. Activities taking place in the park include game drives, nature walks, mountain climbing, wildlife viewing, camping and cave exploration.

Descend to Kibo Hut and then down to the thicker air and relative warmth of Horombo hut. ; 7) Descend to Marangu gate. Route Outline The route described below includes the 'Mawenzi Tarn Hut variation' which is recommended for acclimatization. However, some tours skip this and proceed directly from Simba camp to a 'Third Camp' at around 3700m to Kibo Hut, resulting in a (more difficult because of shorter length) 5-day total trip.  Climbers often omit the second cave during ascent, although the climb is more difficult.

  Mount Sabyinyo ("Sabyinyo" is derived from the Kinyarwanda word "Iryinyo", meaning "tooth"; also "Sabyinyo, Sabyinio") is an extinct volcano in eastern Africa in the Virunga Mountains. Mount Sabyinyo is the oldest volcano of the range. It is north-east of Lake Kivu, one of the African Great Lakes, and west of Lake Bunyonyi in Uganda. The summit of the mountain, at 3669 m, marks the intersection of the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, and Uganda, and holds religious significance to local tribes. It also is within the adjoining national parks established by these countries: Virunga National Park in the DRC, the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda. The slopes of Mt. Sabyinyo are a habitat for the critically endangered mountain gorilla. The mountain carries the local nickname "Old Man's Teeth," because its serrated summit resembles worn teeth in a gum line (in contrast to the perfect conical summits of the adjacent mountains in this range).

   The flag of the Federation of Arab Republics was the flag of Egypt, Libya and Syria from 1972–1977. The flag is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and black with a golden Hawk of Quraish placed on the center on the white stripe. The flag was abandoned in Libya in 1977 after Muammar Gaddafi established the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and adopted a green flag. Egypt and Syria continue to still used the flag of the FAR until the early 1980s. Syria adopted a new flag in 1980 and Egypt in 1984.

  The flag is a tricolor of three equal horizontal stripes (black, white, and green from top to bottom) overlaid by a red triangle issuing from the hoist. These are the Pan-Arab colors. The flag is similar to the flags of Jordan, the Kingdom of Iraq, and Western Sahara, all of which draw their inspiration from the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule (1916–1918). The flag of the Arab Revolt had the same graphic form as the Flag of the Arab Federation and Palestine, but the colors were arranged differently (white on the bottom, rather than in the middle).

  In the Gaddafi era the National team used to play its home matches wearing the green coloured kit representing the Flag of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. This change resulted in changing the national team's kit in order to represent the new flag. The team played its home matches with colours: Red, Black and Green (as in the flag). Red dominates the strip and is the sole jersey colour. The away colours were white in both eras. Since 2011, the LFF emblem and the national team's badge was changed into the current design. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. During late 2011 and early 2012 the Libyan team wore white jerseys temporarily in their qualification games and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. However, in mid-2012 the team began to use red jerseys. In 2014, Libya replaced the green socks worn by the players with black ones. Adidas is the supplier of the official team strip.

The congress led to the creation of the European Movement and, at its first meeting in Strasbourg in September of the same year, adopted the "E" flag but changed the colour red to green.

  Nouakchott (نواكشوط;, originally derived from , "place of the winds") is the capital and largest city of Mauritania. It is one of the largest cities in the Sahel. The city also serves as the administrative and economic center of Mauritania. Nouakchott was a mid-sized village of little importance until 1958, when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. At the time, it was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people. However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. As of 2013, the city had a population of just under a million people. Many of the newcomers settled in slum areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded. However, more recently, the living conditions of some of these inhabitants have improved. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning.

  Health care system of Niger suffers from a chronic lack of resources and a small number of health providers relative to population. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. There are government hospitals in Niamey (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the Hôpital National de Niamey and the Hôpital National De Lamordé), Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns. Medical facilities are limited in both supplies and staff, with a small government health care system supplemented by private, charitable, religious, and Non-government organisation operated clinics and public health programs (such as Galmi Hospital near Birnin Konni and Maradi).

  The Plateau is the central business district of Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire. It is one of the 10 urban communes of the city. The Plateau is surrounded by the municipality of Yopougon to the west, to the south by the Ébrié Lagoon. As a central business district, it brings together most of the city's administrative and commercial activities. Most of the large Ivorian firms have their headquarters in Plateau. It also has a very lively market. Nicknamed by some the "Little Paris" or "Little Manhattan", the Plateau with its towers and buildings overlooks the Ébrié Lagoon. Since the creation of the railway district, to accommodate the terminus of the Abidjan-Niger railway line, the Plateau has rapidly developed to become the administrative, commercial and financial center of Côte d'Ivoire, and holds an important place in West Africa. There is also the Félix Houphouët-Boigny stadium and the cathédrale Saint-Paul. One of its amazing features is to welcome thousands of bats after dark, which gather above the lagoon to hunt mosquitoes and other insects.

  Located on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert, it lies on the west coast of Africa. With the exception of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbor. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story. Nouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with

Nouakchott was a mid-sized village of little importance until 1958, when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. At the time, it was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people. However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. As of 2013, the city had a population of just under a million people. Many of the newcomers settled in slum areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded. However, more recently, the living conditions of some of these inhabitants have improved. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning.

  these intelligence reports even reached Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton. The disclosure of the deception in 1995, following investigations into the Ames case, led to a media stir and heavy congressional criticism. The Agency's Inspector General, Frederick Hitz, identified 12 CIA personnel he deemed responsible for the lapse, including three former directors; CIA Director John M. Deutch criticized seven of these employees, calling the affair "a major intelligence failure". A damage assessment determined that the disinformation altered intelligence analyses of the Soviet (and later Russian) military towards the end of the Cold War, creating a false impression of Soviet strength; however, initial charges that the faulty reports led to billions of dollars' worth of Pentagon spending proved to be exaggerated. Regardless, the revelation further undermined the CIA's credibility in the wake of the Ames case.

The appointment was challenged by some prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Al Gore and Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV). Senator John D. RockefellerIV (D-WV), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed concerns that Goss was too politically partisan, given his public remarks against Democrats while serving as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Another Democratic member of the committee, Ron Wyden (D-OR), expressed concerns that given Goss's history within and ties to the CIA, he would be too disinclined to push for institutional change. In an interview carried out by Michael Moore's production company on March 3, 2004, Goss described himself as "probably not qualified" for a job within the CIA, because the language skills

  The librettist Alan Jay Lerner and the composer Frederick (Fritz) Loewe collaborated on a succession of musicals, beginning in 1942. Their first three shows were unsuccessful, but Brigadoon in 1947 and Paint Your Wagon in 1951 fared better. In 1956 the collaborators triumphed with My Fair Lady, their musical version of Shaw's Pygmalion, which broke the Broadway record for longest-running show. Their MGM musical Gigi became the most honored film musical ever, winning nine Academy Awards, including Lerner's Oscar for best screenplay and both partners' award for the title song. The partners' last collaboration was Camelot (1960).

The score is a mix of disco and typical Broadway show tunes. Jabara had written the show specifically for Bette Midler, who passed on the project.

['In 1944, a group of German saboteurs, known as the "German-American Bund," attempted to detonate explosives in several major cities across the United States. The plot, which was foiled by the FBI, was aimed at causing chaos and panic in the country, and ultimately, topple the Roosevelt administration.\n\nThe Bund was a Nazi organization that operated in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. Led by Fritz Julius Kuhn, a German immigrant, the group sought to promote Nazi ideology and to prevent the United States from entering World War II.\n\nThe failed bomb plot was part of a larger effort by the Bund to destabilize the country and topple the Roosevelt administration. The group believed that the United States was too involved in the war effort and that it was not doing enough to support the German cause.\n\nThe plot involved the placement of explosives in several major cities, including New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The explosives were designed to cause widespread damage and to create panic and chaos.\n\nThe FBI, however, was able to intercept the plot before it could be carried out. In June 1944, the FBI arrested several members of the Bund, including Kuhn, and charged them with conspiracy to commit sabotage.\n\nThe failed bomb plot of ', '"Who was the target of the failed ""Bomb Plot"" of 1944?"']

By June 1948, components for about fifty Fat Man and two Little Boy bombs were on hand. These were not bombs, but components that had to be assembled by specially trained Armed Forces Special Weapons Project assembly teams known as special weapons units. A well-trained team could assemble a bomb in two days, but the teams that had assembled the bombs during the war had returned to civilian life. The first United States Army unit was

  The "German Plot" was a spurious conspiracy alleged in May 1918 by the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland to exist between the Sinn Féin movement and the German Empire to start an armed insurrection in Ireland during World War I. The alleged conspiracy, which would have diverted the British war effort, was used to justify the internment of Sinn Féin leaders, who were actively opposing attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland. The "plot" originated on 12 April when the British arrested Joseph Dowling after he was put ashore in County Clare by a German U-boat. Dowling had been a member of the Irish Brigade, one of several schemes by Roger Casement to get German assistance for the 1916 Easter Rising. Dowling now claimed that the Germans were planning a

['The 80s was a decade filled with iconic pop stars and memorable hits. One such artist was Richard Marx, who had a string of chart-topping singles during this time. One of his most popular songs was "Hold On To The Nights," which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1983.\n\nMarx\'s music career began in 1987 when he signed a record deal with Capitol Records. His debut album, "Richard Marx," was released that same year and included the hit single "Don\'t Mean Nothing." The album went on to sell over 3 million copies worldwide and earned Marx a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n"Hold On To The Nights" was the second single released from Marx\'s debut album. The song\'s catchy melody and Marx\'s smooth vocals made it an instant hit. The music video for the song, which featured Marx and his then-wife Cindy Guidry, became a staple on MTV and helped to further establish Marx as a rising star in the music industry.\n\nThe success of "Hold On To The Nights" paved the way for Marx\'s continued success in the 80s and beyond. He went on to release several more hit albums and singles, including "Endless Summer Nights"', 'Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?']

  The supporting cast includes Brian Donlevy, George Sanders and Chill Wills. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in both films as well as Dark Command the following year, Trevor is top-billed over Wayne due to her greater name value at the time. The film did not fare well in its initial release. The superficially similar John Ford film Drums Along the Mohawk had been released only one week prior. In the United Kingdom, where the film kept the original title, it was initially banned by the Ministry of Information for placing the British, already at war against Nazi Germany, in a bad light.

  Frontier Marshal is a 1939 Western film directed by Allan Dwan and starring Randolph Scott as Wyatt Earp. The film is the second film produced by Sol M. Wurtzel based on Stuart N. Lake's biography of Earp, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (later found to be largely fictionalized). An earlier version was Wurtzel's Frontier Marshal, filmed in 1934. The film was remade by John Ford in 1946 as My Darling Clementine, which included whole scenes reshot from the 1939 film. Frontier Marshal co-stars Nancy Kelly, Cesar Romero as "Doc Halliday" (the name was changed for the film from the original "Holliday" because of fear of a lawsuit from Holliday's family), John Carradine, and Lon Chaney, Jr.. Ward Bond appears as the town marshal; Bond was also in the 1934 version, and later appears as Morgan Earp in Ford's film. Eddie Foy, Jr., plays the large supporting role of his father, entertainer Eddie Foy, in this as well as three other feature films, and looks almost exactly like his famous father.

Lake's enormously popular but largely fictitious "biography" of Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. A second version of the film, also produced by Wurtzel, was made in 1939, and a third interpretation by John Ford entitled My Darling Clementine was released in 1946. He supposedly wrote the book with Earp's input,i and it portrays Earp as a fearless lawman. But before the first movie was released, his widow Josephine Earp sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the film. She said it was an "unauthorized portrayal" of Wyatt Earp. She succeeded in getting Earp's name completely excised from the movie. His character was renamed "Michael Wyatt," and the movie was released as Frontier Marshal.

  The Heroes were an English rock band formed in 1979, with Chris Bradford and Mark Hankins on guitar and vocals. The line-up was completed by Pete Lennon (lead guitar), Dave Powell (drums) and ex-Randy band-member Brian (Wally) Wallis on bass guitar. Although primarily a recording group, they performed a tour of Germany with Dr. Feelgood, playing the Olympianhalle in Munich and the Top Ten Club in Hamburg. Playing good time rock and roll, the five piece recorded an album of ten Bradford penned songs: Border Raiders in 1980, plus a single "Some Kind of Women" b/w "10 % Will Do" all released on the Polydor label.

  The band was originally formed in 1975 by college friends Mike Finney (vocals) and Steve Perrin (guitar), alongside Lawrence Tickle (bass) and Tony Trappe (drums). The band changed tack with the advent of punk in 1977 and Finney and Perrin recruited a new line-up of Pip Nicholls (bass), Adrian Wright (guitar), and Alec Sidebottom (drums, formerly of The Purple Gang), now mixing punk rock with sixties influences. They shared bills with the likes of Buzzcocks, Magazine and Joy Division, and their debut EP, You're Not Going Out Dressed Like That, released in 1979, led to a deal with Factory Records, who released the follow-up, Time Goes By So

O'Neill wrote songs for Paul Young and Lene Lovich, while Burns played guitar in Adam Ant's backing band during 1982–1984, together with Fingerprintz drummer Bogdan Wiczling. O'Neill, who, in the mid 1970s, had worked for a time as a clerical assistant in the Department of Health and Social Security, released a single for Oval Records in 1975, "Achin' in My Heart"/"Cold on Me", under the name Jimme Shelter (a throwback to the song, "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones).

In early 1979, a song from their first album "Woortcha!" was used for a television commercial for Courage Bitter, and this song was then re-recorded and released as a single, retitled "Gertcha", which reached No. 20 on the singles chart.

Arena rock bands like Journey, Kansas, Styx, GTR, ELO and Foreigner either had begun as progressive rock bands or included members with strong ties to the genre. These groups retained some of the song complexity and orchestral-style arrangements, but they moved away from lyrical mysticism in favour of more conventional themes such as relationships. Genesis transformed into a successful pop act, and a re-formed Yes released the relatively mainstream 90125 (1983), which yielded their only US number-one single, "Owner of a Lonely Heart".

['Bob Dylan\'s 1965 album "Highway 61 Revisited" is a classic in the singer-songwriter\'s discography. The album, which was released on August 19, 1965, features some of Dylan\'s most famous and influential songs, including "Like a Rolling Stone," "Ballad of a Thin Man," and "Desolation Row."\n\nThe album\'s title refers to the famous U.S. Highway 61, which runs from the southern tip of Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. Dylan\'s lyrics often reference the highway and its surrounding towns and landmarks, such as "Duluth, Minnesota" and "Memphis, Tennessee."\n\nThe album\'s sound is characterized by its use of electric guitars and drums, which was a departure from Dylan\'s earlier acoustic folk style. The album\'s production, which was handled by Tom Wilson, is often cited as a major influence on the development of rock and roll.\n\n"Highway 61 Revisited" is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential albums in the history of popular music. It has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork.\n\nIn', 'Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?']

  Live at The Gaslight 1962 captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" (often referred to as "Hard Rain"), "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right", and "John Brown". Both "Hard Rain" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" would eventually appear on Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan", in May 1963. Around the same time, a studio version of "John Brown" was included on the Folkways Records compilation Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1 in February 1963, but it would not be released on any of Dylan's subsequent studio albums (much later the song would re-appear as a live performance on Dylan's 1995 MTV Unplugged album.) "Rocks and Gravel", also credited as a Bob Dylan composition, is Dylan's own adaptation of Brownie McGhee's "Solid Road" and Leroy Carr's "Alabama Woman", an arrangement that

  Desire is the seventeenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on January 5, 1976, through Columbia Records. It is one of Dylan's most collaborative efforts, featuring the same caravan of musicians as the acclaimed Rolling Thunder Revue tours the previous year (later documented on The Bootleg Series Vol. 5). Many of the songs also featured backing vocals by Emmylou Harris and Ronee Blakley. Most of the album was co-written by Jacques Levy, and is composed of lengthy story-songs, two of which quickly generated controversy: the 11-minute-long "Joey", which is seen as glorifying the violent gangster "Crazy Joey" Gallo, and "Hurricane", the opening track that tells a

  It is not known when Dylan wrote the songs for Rough and Rowdy Ways although it is possible, as with his previous album of original material, Tempest, that he may have been working on them with his band during soundchecks on the last tour before they went into the studio to record. Musically, it is one of Dylan's most diverse albums. It mixes acoustic folk songs ("I Contain Multitudes", "Black Rider", "Mother of Muses", "Key West (Philosopher Pirate)") with electric blues stomps ("False Prophet", "Goodbye Jimmy Reed", "Crossing the Rubicon"), a torch ballad ("I've Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You"), and a couple of unconventional

  a badge of hip taste in the 1960s, evidenced by its appearance in the album cover photo to Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home amid various emblems of bohemian life. Songs from the album were repeatedly covered throughout the decade by many artists, notably Eric Clapton who recorded "Ramblin' On My Mind" on John Mayall's 1966 classic Bluesbreakers album, and "Cross Road Blues" with his own power trio Cream on the 1968 album Wheels of Fire.

In late January, he finally premiered Renaldo and Clara, the part-fiction, part-concert film shot in the fall of 1975, during the first Rolling Thunder Revue tour. Though the performances were well-received, the overwhelming majority of film reviews were negative, particularly those by The Village Voice, which printed four negative reviews by four different critics.

Gradually, though, the lines changed, until he settled upon a verse from Jeremiah—the one he would quote on the inner sleeve of the Saved album: 'Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah' (Jeremiah 31)."

It was originally slated to appear on Dylan's second album (and later appeared on test pressings made for a preliminary version of the LP), but when Dylan reconfigured The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, he omitted "Rocks And Gravel" from the final album sequence. The remaining songs on Live at The Gaslight 1962 show off the young Dylan's already-broad knowledge of traditional folk songs. These include, among others, “The Cuckoo”, which was recorded as early as the 1920s by western North Carolina banjo musician Clarence Ashley; “Moonshiner”, a traditional song that had also been performed by Irish folksters The Clancy Brothers (playing together with Pete Seeger) as well as by Appalachian folk singer Roscoe Holcomb; and “Barbara Allen” LINK, described by music historian Dave Marsh as “the most widespread folk song in the English language.”

  Slow Train Coming is the 19th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 20, 1979, by Columbia Records. Slow Train is the title song of the album. It was Dylan's first album following his brief flirtation with Christianity, and the songs either express personal faith, or stress the importance of Christian teachings and philosophy. The evangelical nature of the record alienated many of Dylan's existing fans; at the same time, many Christians were drawn into his fan base. Slow Train Coming was listed at in the 2001 book CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music. The album was generally well-reviewed by music critics, and the single "Gotta Serve Somebody" became his first hit in three years, winning Dylan the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1980. The album peaked at on the charts in the UK and went platinum in the US, where it reached. A high-definition 5.1 surround sound edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.

  Rough and Rowdy Ways is the 39th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on June 19, 2020, through Columbia Records. It is Dylan's first album of original songs since his 2012 album Tempest, following three releases, one a triple album, that covered traditional pop standards. The album was recorded at Sound City Studios in January and February 2020. The session musicians included all of the then-current members of Dylan's Never Ending Tour band alongside other musicians, such as Blake Mills and Fiona Apple. The album's sound was described by critics as Americana, folk, blues, and rhythm and blues. Rough and Rowdy Ways was preceded by the singles "Murder Most Foul", "I Contain Multitudes" and "False Prophet"; "Murder Most Foul" became Dylan's first song to top any US Billboard chart. The album was universally praised by critics, described as being one of Dylan's best works and placing highly in many year-end album lists, including the top spot on four lists. It peaked at No. 1 in more than ten countries and No. 2 in the United States and Australia.

The 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union, were boycotted by 65 countries, including the United States, in response to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics was also the first to be held in a non-communist country since the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics was Yugoslavia.\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics was significant for several reasons. It was the first time that the United States hosted the Summer Olympics since 1960, and it was the first time that the Summer Olympics were held in a non-communist country since 1964.

['The 90s sci fi series "Max Headroom" was based on the comic strip of the same name created by British writer and artist Matt Davey. The show, which aired from 1987 to 1990, followed the adventures of a detective named Edison Carter, played by Matt Frewer, who was killed in a car accident but was brought back to life as a computer-enhanced being known as Max Headroom. The series was set in a dystopian future where corporations had taken over society, and Max used his unique abilities to fight against their oppressive rule. The show was known for its groundbreaking use of computer-generated imagery and its exploration of themes such as identity, memory, and the relationship between humans and technology.\n\nHowever, the question asked for a different series, which is "Max Headroom" based on Bruce Wagner\'s comic strip of the same name. Unfortunately, there is no such series. The comic strip, which ran from 1980 to 1985, was a satirical commentary on the advertising industry and featured a character named Max Headroom, who was a computer-enhanced being. The comic strip was not adapted into a TV series, and the 1987 TV series "Max Headroom" was based on a completely different source material.\n\nIn conclusion, the 90s sci fi', "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"]

They released a CD with music from Awesome Show entitled Tim and Eric Awesome Record, Great Songs! and in 2012 they released a feature film, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie. The duo's work is known for its distinctive and often grotesque nature, typically featuring "bad fashions, worse hair, intentionally stilted line readings, takes that linger two seconds too long, and an intense attention to the tchotchkes and hobbies everyday people substitute for personalities." Their projects often feature amateur performers and intentionally crude or tacky production values inspired by low-budget advertising, public access television, and video art.

  "If I Were a Rich Man" is a show tune from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. It was written by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock. The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The title is inspired by a 1902 monologue by Sholem Aleichem in Yiddish, Ven ikh bin Rothschild (If I were a Rothschild), a reference to the wealth of the Rothschild family, although the content is quite different. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story "The Bubble Bursts." Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye's Daughters.

  The song is broken into four verses, with a bridge between the third and fourth and a chorus sung at the beginning of the song, and after the second and fourth verses. Musically, it is written in a Jewish klezmer style. Through the first two verses, Tevye dreams of the material comforts that wealth would bring him. Sung boisterously and comedically, Tevye first considers the enormous house he would buy and the needless luxuries he would fill it with, including a third staircase "leading nowhere, just for show," then the poultry he would buy to fill his yard. Tevye switches his attention to the luxuries in which

  The Oxford Companion to the American Musical wrote that the song includes passages of "cantor-like chanting", and is "the most revealing of the many character numbers". The Broadway Musical: A Critical and Musical Survey explained that the song contains a greater number of Jewish "commonplaces" than any other number in the score, and added the song does twofold: it "offers such a strong dose of idiom early in the show [which] is good for the overall unity", and the "important dramatic function" of introducing the central character of Tevye through song. History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe explains that the song is based on a monologue from the stories of Sholem Aleichem entitled "If I were Rothschild", in reference to the wealthy Jewish banking family. The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase "if I were a rich man" to the Cowardly Lion's "if I were king of the forest" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine. It has been suggested that song is inspired by a Hasidic folk song.

  would shower his wife, Golde, in the third verse. He talks of servants to alleviate her workload, fancy clothes for her pleasure, and mountains of food. The song is sung in the same boisterous, comedic style. The music and vocals intensify during the bridge, when Tevye starts lamenting his place in the community as a lowly milkman, and considers the esteem and importance that wealth would bring him. In the final verse, Tevye softens as he further considers his devotion to God. He expresses his sorrow that the long working hours he keeps prevents him from spending as much time in the synagogue as he would like,

  how wealth would allow him to spend less time working and more time praying and studying the Torah, and finally asking God if "it would spoil a vast eternal plan" if he were wealthy. A repeated phrase throughout the song, "all day long I'd bidi-bidi-bum," is often misunderstood to refer to Tevye's desire not to have to work. However, in an interview with Terry Gross, Sheldon Harnick said he basically made up syllables that he thought would give the effect of Chassidic chanting. The first person to play Tevye, Zero Mostel, then replaced the syllables Harnick had written with ones that Mostel thought would be more authentic.

Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to rewrite the song, suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song. Since she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to Broadway to better understand the theme that "even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich." The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill. She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way", but when she presented him with the song, "he just totally tricked the track out."

The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The title is inspired by a 1902 monologue by Sholem Aleichem in Yiddish, Ven ikh bin Rothschild (If I were a Rothschild), a reference to the wealth of the Rothschild family, although the content is quite different. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story "The Bubble Bursts." Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye's Daughters.
 2 -0.10014  duo Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1993 song "Rich Girl", which itself interpolated "If I Were a Rich Man" from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to rewrite the song, suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song. Since she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to Broadway to better understand the theme that "even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich." The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill. She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way", but when she presented him with the song, "he just totally tricked the track out."
 3 -0.49349  The Oxford Companion to the American Musical wrote that the song includes passages of "cantor-like chanting", and is "the most revealing of the many character numbers". The Broadway Musical: A Critical and Musical Survey explained that the song contains a greater number of Jewish "commonplaces" than any other number in the score, and added the song does twofold: it "offers such a strong dose of idiom early in the show [which] is good for the overall unity", and the "important dramatic function" of introducing the central character of Tevye through song. History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe explains that the song is based on a monologue from the stories of Sholem Aleichem entitled "If I were Rothschild", in reference to the wealthy Jewish banking family. The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase "if I were a rich man" to the Cowardly Lion's "if I were king of the forest" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine. It has been suggested that song is inspired by a Hasidic folk song.
 4 -6.22897  "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" is a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film High Society, where it was introduced by Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Whilst looking at expensive wedding presents, the singers decide that they in fact have little desire to be fabulously wealthy. The song also appeared in the 1973 Christmas special of The Goodies television series, The Goodies and the Beanstalk. It later inspired the title, and title music, of the popular game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
 5 -6.74112  You'll Never Get Rich (Columbia Pictures) is a 1941 Hollywood musical comedy romance film with humorous wartime theme directed by Sidney Lanfield and starring Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth as opposite leads, Robert Benchley, Cliff Nazarro, with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The title stems from an old Army song which includes lyrics "You'll never get rich / by digging a ditch / you're in the Army now!" This was Hayworth's first important role in a big budgeted film from her home studio Columbia Pictures. While the film was in production, Life magazine put her on its cover, and featured inside a photo of Hayworth kneeling on a bed in a nightgown, which soon became one

The first book featured the island, the pirates and a character Tom Ayrton who was marooned on a nearby island. The second book featured Captain Nemo and the Nautilus presumed lost in the maelstrom at the end of that novel. In The Mysterious Island (1874) after the escapees' balloon landed on the island, among many adventures, they encountered Ayrton alive, fought the pirates and discovered that Captain Nemo was their benefactor and the island the base for the Nautilus.

After finding shelter they set out to explore the island. They soon find that everything they need seems to grow on trees. They explore, hunt wild boar, and construct a signal flag to attract passing ships. During a tremendous storm, an emigrant ship is wrecked on the coral reef just off the island. Otto and Dominick Rigonda run to aid the passengers. The two parties become acquainted and work together to build suitable housing.

They discover that the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt. When they reach the other side of the island, they encounter a giant crab. After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner.

  The Pirate City was written shortly after Ballantyne spent several months in Algiers, learning of the city's history. The lawlessness of this setting was based on historical fact. Large amounts of navy deserters from the powers involved in the Napoleonic Wars gathered in Algiers in the early 1800s. Criminals of all countries used the town as their haven, joining one another in order to conduct piratical raids on ships near the north coast of Africa, leading to the city being deemed the 'Pirates Nest' by the seafarers of the time. The Pirate City's climax occurs when Britain's Lord Exmouth (a.k.a. Edward Pellew) attacks the city of Algiers in order to rescue the city's Christian inhabitants and disband the pirate forces. This event, known as the "Bombardment of Algiers" happened in August 1816, when British and Dutch forces, led by Exmouth

A total of ten other novels did, however, with most titles spending only a few weeks at the top. The strongest performing title was The Naked and the Dead, Norman Mailer's first best seller, published when he was just 25 years old, which spent 19 weeks at Number 1 and more than 6 months in the top 10. It was the first "big" novel about World War II, based on his own experiences. The Ides of March was by Thornton Wilder and it spent 2 weeks at Number 1 but only 13 weeks in the top 15. The year ended with The Big Fisherman heading the list, Lloyd C. Douglas's follow-up to his huge 1942 best seller, The Robe.

  My Memoir is a 1938 memoir by Edith Wilson, a First Lady of the United States and the wife of Woodrow Wilson. She wrote the book as an apologia to defend her husband from perceived attacks, and to preserve his legacy. Critics generally considered the book to be "delightful" as a "collection of episodes", but especially those writing at publication predicted it would be of little historical value except for its account of Woodrow Wilson's stroke and last days in office. However it has been used by academic historians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to examine a variety of topics related to Edith Wilson.

During a spa stay in Cannstatt for several years, the Jacobs started to write books. Much better known than his extensive scientific works on chemistry, physics and electricity was the cookbook of his wife. She became the most successful Palatinate cookbook author under the pseudonym "Emmy Braun". It was said to be sold as often as the Bible. Luise Jacob also became known for her embroidery, which was shown and honored at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

A previous, bowdlerized version was originally known in English as The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova (from the French Mémoires de Jacques Casanova) until the original version was published in 1960. From 1838 to 1960, all the editions of the memoirs were derived from the censored editions produced in German and French in the early nineteenth century. Arthur Machen used one of these inaccurate versions for his English translation published in 1894 which remained the standard English edition for many years.

  Wilson wrote the memoir and picked Woodrow's first biographer, Ray Stannard Baker, to create "a fortress around her husband's vulnerabilities and shortcomings and magnif[y] his achievements". Edith published My Memoir in 1938. It was published by Bobbs-Merrill Company. The book focuses on her time with Woodrow with several chapters of background on her life. In the foreword of the book, she wrote of an intent to reveal "the truth concerning personal matters which has often been distorted by the misinformed". Amy R. Slagell and Susan Zaeske, writing in Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century, feel that the book had two purposes: to "garner credit for the strenuous work she [Edith] performed in her role as first lady" and to defend her husband's legacy in the face of perceived attacks from the likes of John Singer Sargent and Joseph P. Tumulty (whom she personally disliked). In the memoir, she emphasizes that her husband's doctors urged Edith to serve as "steward" of the presidency. My Memoir was reprinted in 1993.

  Helen Clay Frick (September 2, 1888 &ndash; November 9, 1984) was an American philanthropist and art collector. She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the third child of the coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick (1849&ndash;1919) and his wife, Adelaide Howard Childs (1859&ndash;1931). Two of her siblings did not reach adulthood, and her father played favorites with his two surviving children, Childs Frick (1883&ndash;1965) and Helen. After the reading of their father's will, which favored Helen, the brother and sister were estranged for the rest of their lives. Nonetheless, Helen developed as a strong, independent and spirited young woman. She was equally interested in art history and philanthropy, making a catalogue of her father's art collection as a young woman, a collection which became the Frick Collection in New York. Her

A second edition was published in 1871 which included previously unpublished Jane Austen writings. A family project, the biography was written by James Edward Austen-Leigh but owed much to the recollections of Jane Austen's many relatives. However, it was the decisions of her sister, Cassandra Austen, to destroy many of Jane's letters after her death that shaped the material available for the biography. Austen-Leigh described his "dear Aunt Jane" domestically, as someone who was uninterested in fame and who only wrote in her spare time. However, the

['\n\n"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."\n\n\nIn this passage, Jesus is speaking to his disciples about the difficulty of entering the kingdom of God for those who are wealthy. The phrase "eye of a needle" is a metaphor for something that is nearly impossible to achieve. The idea is that a camel, which is a large and cumbersome animal, would have a very difficult time passing through the small opening of a needle. Similarly, a rich person would have a very difficult time entering the kingdom of God, which is often seen as a spiritual realm that is difficult to access. This passage highlights the idea that wealth and material possessions can be a barrier to spiritual growth and enlightenment.', '"Complete this Biblical quotation: ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than..."']

The verse appears when king Abimelech of Gerar is speaking to Abraham and his wife Sarah whom he had taken as his wife thinking her Abraham's sister: וּלְשָׂרָה אָמַר, הִנֵּה נָתַתִּי אֶלֶף כֶּסֶף לְאָחִיךְ--הִנֵּה הוּא-לָךְ כְּסוּת עֵינַיִם, לְכֹל אֲשֶׁר אִתָּךְ; וְאֵת כֹּל, וְנֹכָחַת. The King James Version translates as follows: One commentator has interpreted the phrase as implied advice to Sarah to conform to a supposed custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face, but the phrase

  notes that this expression only works with the Aramaic alphabet or square script, and not the Ancient Hebrew alphabet. This is historically consistent as the Aramaic script had largely displaced the ancient one by this period. The word translated as tittle in the KJV in Greek is keraia, and there is much debate as to what it might have referred to. The word keraia literally translates as horns. One possibility is that it refers to the decorative crowns placed atop some Hebrew letters, this would not work for Jesus, however, as such markings only began to be used in the later part of the first century.

 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father’s name written on their foreheads. Translated as "a lamb" in the King James and New King James versions, but as "the lamb" in many other translations. This lamb is, "of course, the same as the lamb seen in chapter 5", but there the lamb looked "as if it had been slain", whereas here it is standing triumphant on Mount Zion: "probably the earthly one, [because] the heavenly Jerusalem of chapter 21 has not yet appeared". The King James Version states that the 144,000 had "his Father's name" written on their foreheads but the majority of English translations refer to "his name and his Father’s name". This reading is supported by Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Epraemi Rescriptus as well as most cursives and the writings of the early Fathers of the Church.

['Truman Capote was born in Louisiana in 1924. His birth name was Truman Streckfus Persons, but he was adopted by his stepfather, Arch Persons, and took his surname.\n\nCapote\'s childhood was marked by tragedy. His mother died when he was just four years old, and he was sent to live with relatives. He was later sent to live with his grandparents, who were strict and religious.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Capote was a gifted writer from a young age. He attended college in New York City, where he began to write for magazines and newspapers.\n\nCapote\'s breakthrough came in 1966 with the publication of "In Cold Blood," a true crime novel that became an instant classic. The book, which chronicled the brutal murder of a Kansas family, was a groundbreaking work of nonfiction that blurred the lines between fact and fiction.\n\nCapote\'s writing style was characterized by his use of dialogue and his ability to create vivid, memorable characters. He was known for his meticulous research and his willingness to spend years on a single project.\n\nCapote\'s other notable works include "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s," a collection of short stories that was adapted into a classic film starring Audrey Hepburn, and "The Grass Harp," a novel that explored', "What was Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather?"]

  Not wanting to take up his incomplete first novel, Summer Crossing, Capote began writing The Grass Harp in June 1950 and completed it on May 27, 1951. The novel was inspired by memories of his Alabama childhood, specifically a tree house constructed in the 1930s in a large walnut tree in his cousin Jenny's backyard. This large tree house, accessible by an antique spiral staircase, featured cypress wood construction and a tin roof, and was furnished with a rattan sofa. Capote spent time in this tree house with his cousin Sook or other childhood friends such as Nelle Harper Lee. The novel was additionally inspired by his cousin Sook's dropsy medicine, which she made yearly until the age of 62. She took the recipe for it to the grave, despite Jenny's wanting first

His novels are renowned for their attention to historical detail and context and for the author's crisp wit and interest in the "bystanders" to larger historical events. He is the author of nine books of fiction, including Henry and Clara, Two Moons, Dewey Defeats Truman, Aurora 7, Bandbox, Fellow Travelers, Watergate, Finale, and most recently Landfall. He has also published nonfiction on plagiarism (Stolen Words), diaries (A Book of One's Own), letters (Yours Ever) and the Kennedy assassination (Mrs. Paine's Garage), as well as two volumes of essays (Rockets and Rodeos and In Fact).

The last section was airmailed to the publishers Random House just days after he finished writing it, but it was not published for four months because the editors, specifically Bob Linscott, did not care for the ending of the novel. Linscott thought that the ending was weak because, once the characters were up in the tree house, Capote "didn't know what to do with them." He asked Capote to rewrite the ending, and Capote made some changes in it, but he did not completely rewrite it. Truman Capote initially wanted to title the novel Music of the Sawgrass. It was Bob Linscott who gave it the title The Grass Harp.

Goldman's personal life, as described in the introduction and commentary in the novel, is fictional. In The Princess Bride, Goldman claimed to have one son with his wife, Helen, a psychiatrist. In reality, Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, in 1961. They had two daughters named Jenny and Susanna, and they divorced in 1991.

  This novel includes several narrative techniques or literary devices including a fictional frame story about how Goldman came to know about and decided to adapt S. Morgenstern's The Princess Bride. In Goldman's "footnotes," he describes how his father used to read The Princess Bride aloud to him; thus the book became Goldman's favorite without him ever actually reading the text. As a father, Goldman looked forward to sharing the story with his own son, going to great lengths to locate a copy for his son's birthday, only to be crushed when his son stops reading after the first chapter. When Goldman revisits the book himself, he discovers that what he believed

['In November 1979, the book that knocked Henry Kissinger\'s "White House Years" out of first place on the best-seller list was "The Executioner\'s Song" by Norman Mailer. This true crime novel tells the story of Gary Gilmore, who was executed for murder in Utah in 1977. The book is a detailed and often graphic account of Gilmore\'s life, his crimes, and his final days. It explores themes of justice, mercy, and the death penalty, and has been praised for its literary merit and its insight into the human condition.\n\nMailer spent months interviewing Gilmore and his family, as well as the people involved in his case, and he presents a complex and nuanced portrait of a flawed and troubled man. The book is also notable for its innovative use of narrative structure, which includes multiple perspectives and a nonlinear timeline.\n\n"The Executioner\'s Song" was a critical and commercial success, winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1980 and selling over 1 million copies. It has been adapted into a film and a stage play, and it remains a powerful and thought-provoking work of literature.\n\nIn terms of its impact on the best-seller list, "The Executioner\'s Song" held the number one spot for 13 weeks, and it was the', "What book knocked Henry Kissinger's White house Years out of first place on the best-seller list in November 1979?"]

  King wrote a few parts of a story by the same name and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of Christmas cards, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. Philtrum Press produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items. In 2000, King published the novella Riding the Bullet over the Internet, making it the world's first mass market e-book. However, there were technical problems with downloading, and hackers eventually cracked the encryption. Later that year, King released The Plant directly via his website, unencrypted and in installments. People could pay a $1 fee for each installment using the honor system. King said, however, that he would drop the project if the percentage of paying readers fell below 75 percent. He viewed the release as an experiment in alternate forms of

  during the Watergate hearings, Meier wanted to tell the nation secrets about the Nixon White House, the CIA, and Howard Hughes, but to keep him from telling his secrets, he was persecuted, jailed and forced into exile in Canada. Meier was the first person to reveal everything from the Hughes Organization, and Robert Maheu's, involvement with the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, to Thane Cesar's connection to Jack Hooper. According to investigate reporter and New York Times bestselling author Jim Hougan, "John Meier's story is really interesting and, I believe, important.

  or politics, the real miracle here is how, even after 700 pages, we can still be racing along, steeling ourselves for the very last line, a line we’re desperate to reach — but not too soon." Paste Magazine's Bridey Heing commends Oates' ability to navigate both sides of a deeply polarizing topic, noting how, "Ultimately, Oates does not moralize, and this isn’t a book that will comfort those who are strong in their beliefs. But in that lies the book’s value. At a time when we as a society feel so ideologically distant and yet are told that we have more in common than all that divides us, this novel rings true without being weighed down by sentimentality."

  The Road to Serfdom (German: Der Weg zur Knechtschaft) is a book written between 1940 and 1943 by Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. Since its publication in 1944, The Road to Serfdom has influenced the political imagination of conservative and classical liberal thinkers. It has been translated into more than 20 languages and sold over two million copies (as of 2010). The book was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944, during World War II, and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it "that unobtainable book", also due in part to wartime paper rationing. It was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in September 1944 and achieved great popularity. At the arrangement of editor

['The Snark was a Boojum, you see.\n\nA Boojum you say?\n\nTis a portmanteau word, so the story goes,\n\nWhich means something that happens when a word or two\n\nGets squished together, like a grape in a press,\n\nOr a boojum in a dream.\n\nIn this case, the Boojum was a creature that\n\nLived in the land of the Jubjub trees,\n\nAnd was known to be a trickster, a tease,\n\nA troublemaker, a snark.\n\nBut the hunters, being hunters, were not fooled,\n\nThey knew that the Boojum was just a disguise,\n\nA clever ruse to throw them off the trail,\n\nAnd they pressed on, determined to prevail.\n\nBut the Boojum was cunning, and it played tricks,\n\nIt would hide in the shadows, or leap out from behind a tree,\n\nIt would whisper in their ears, or sing a haunting melody,\n\nAnd the hunters, being hunters, were not easily fooled,\n\nBut they were not immune to its charms,\n\nAnd they would sometimes forget their mission,\n\nAnd lose themselves in its enchanting song.\n\nAnd so the hunters chased the Boojum', "In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?"]

  Percy Garnett Williams was born on May 4, 1857, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the son of John B. Williams, a doctor and editor of the Baltimore Family Journal. Percy Williams was expected to also become a doctor, and after graduating from Baltimore College he studied medicine for a while. However, he was fascinated with theater. He organized and became the manager of the Courtland Dramatic Club. He played at the Front Street Theatre and Colonel Sinn's Theatre in Baltimore, then moved to Brooklyn in 1875, where he performed with Colonel Sinn's Park Theatre. He spent two seasons in Brooklyn, then returned to Baltimore and was the leading comedian in the Holliday Street Theater stock company. He performed in a traveling production of Uncle Tom's Cabin

Titled The First President, it was focused on George Washington and his influence on the history of the United States of America and was intended to "galvanize us into a realization of what we are today." In his modernist epic collage of place titled Paterson (published between 1946 and 1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of Paterson, New Jersey, Williams wrote his own modern epic poem, focusing on "the local" on a wider scale than

["The only Englishman to become Pope was Adrian IV, born in Northamptonshire in 1100. He was elected in 1154 and died in 1159. Adrian was born Nicholas Breakspear, and was the son of a wealthy landowner. He was educated at St. Albans and Oxford, and became a Benedictine monk at St. Albans. He was ordained a priest in 1135, and was made a cardinal in 1157. After the death of Pope Eugene III, the cardinals elected Adrian as Pope. He was the first Englishman to be elected to the papacy, and the second Englishman to become a cardinal. Adrian's papacy was marked by his efforts to reform the Church and to improve relations between the Church and secular rulers. He also worked to strengthen the Church's position in England, and to promote English interests in Europe. Adrian's most significant achievement was the signing of the Treaty of Westminster in 1155, which established a peace settlement between England and Scotland. Adrian died in 1159, and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. He was canonized as a saint in 1977.", 'Who was the only Englishman to become Pope?']

  Francesco Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius III, was the first cardinal protector of England, elevated on the initiative of King Henry VII, and also the first officially approved cardinal protector of "any nation whatever". Henry VII viewed good relations with Rome as a protection against domestic and foreign enemies and sent Christopher Urswick, his "almoner and trusted councillor" to Rome after receiving a bull of dispensation to marry Elizabeth of York. When Henry VII first sought a cardinal protector in 1492, he feared that many of the English bishops would support his Yorkist opponents (to whom they owed their appointments). A variety of other disagreements existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal of the pope to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII

In his province he was vigorous and strict, and tried for some time in vain to bring the powerful abbots under his control. He took part with Pope Innocent II against Anacletus, received Innocent at Rouen in 1131, and rejoined him at the council of Rheims in the same year, bringing him letters in which the king of England recognised him as lawful pope. Henry I had taken the side of the abbots in their recent struggle with Hugh, and he was now further incensed by Hugh's refusal to consecrate Richard,

  Ealdred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to Lyfing, his predecessor as bishop of Worcester. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became Abbot of Gloucester. Ealdred was a monk in the cathedral chapter at Winchester Cathedral before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043. Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death. No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.

  From William's name, it is presumed that he was a native of Sainte-Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados in Normandy (Neustria). He was a canon of York Minster in 1128. He was Dean of York by December 1138. William was elected to the see of Durham on 14 March 1143 and consecrated on 20 June 1143. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. However, the new bishop

  Many in Rome still thought reconciliation with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned and sentenced to death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England. Queen Mary I of England briefly reconciled with Rome and appointed Reginald Pole as archbishop of Canterbury. However, "papal restoration in England was doomed even before it was accomplished" when Mary I married Philip II of Spain. In 1555, Pope Paul IV named a new cardinal protector, Giovanni Morone, but the queen did not confirm the nomination and Campeggio remained the last cardinal protector "chosen by the crown". Meanwhile, loyalty to the pope became a defining feature of the movement for Irish nationalism and bishops appointed by the pope garnered a larger following than the hierarchy of the church of Ireland appointed by the crown. According to Wilkie, "the cardinal protectors had assisted in the loss of England to the papacy, and Ireland remained loyal to the papacy in spite of them".

  also led the English diplomatic corps in Rome. Although earlier cardinals had filled similar roles, "the existence of national protectorships was first openly and regularly recognized only" by Pope Julius II. The terms 'cardinal protector' and 'cardinal procurator' were "used very loosely and sometimes interchangeably during the fifteenth century". The earliest reference to a 'cardinal protector' of England dates from 1492, but according to Wilkie, this results from a confusion between this office and that of cardinal procurator. Unlike other national cardinal protectors, the cardinal protectors of England, Scotland, and Ireland were generally chosen exclusively by the pope. The cardinal was "imposed from above, rather than chosen" and often had no direct relationship with the governments of these countries. The English cardinal protector played a large role in English ecclesiastical appointments, and a substantial role in similar appointments in Scotland and Ireland.

['In the Bible, the story of Joshua and the battle of Jericho is a well-known tale. However, there is another lesser-known story that is equally fascinating. In the book of Joshua, there is an account of a miraculous event that occurred during a battle between the Israelites and the Amorites.\n\nThe battle took place in the valley of Aijalon, which is located between Bethel and Jericho. The Israelites were greatly outnumbered and outmatched by the Amorites, who had a large army and were well-trained in warfare.\n\nThe Israelites, led by Joshua, prayed to God for help. God answered their prayers by causing the sun and moon to stand still in the sky. This allowed the Israelites to defeat the Amorites and win the battle.\n\nThe passage that describes this event is found in Joshua 10:12-14. It reads, "At that time Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, \'Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the valley of Aijalon.\' And the sun stood still and the moon stopped, until the nation avenged itself on its enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and', 'In the Bible, who did the sun and moon stand still before?']

Waddington of Oxford University considered the possibility that a lunar, rather than solar, eclipse might have taken place. They concluded that such an eclipse would have been visible, for thirty minutes, from Jerusalem and suggested the gospel reference to a solar eclipse was the result of a scribe wrongly amending a text. Historian David Henige dismisses this explanation as 'indefensible' and astronomer Bradley Schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.

  feud between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood. However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and tried to knock the wind out of him with the butt of his spear. However, probably by intervention of God, it went through Asahel. The Bible says everyone stopped and looked. That shows that something like

  With various other sites around the Mediterranean, they were a feature of the Neolithic temple site of Tas-Silġ and other sites on Malta and Gozo. The Hittites worshiped sacred stones called Huwasi stones. In the Hebrew Bible, Bethel (meaning "House of God"), is where Jacob had his vision of Jacob's ladder. Coming upon the place at nightfall, the Book of Genesis tells the reader that he laid his head on a stone, and had the vision while sleeping, then: 16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” 17 He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”

The film, which also featured Val Kilmer as the Caped Crusader, was not a critical or commercial success, but it did have one memorable moment.\n\nIn the movie, Pfeiffer\'s character, Dr. Chase Meridian, is a psychiatrist who becomes involved with Batman (Kilmer) and the villainous Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones). One of the most iconic scenes in the film is when Meridian sings the song "Still" by Elton John, which plays over a montage of her and Batman\'s relationship.\n\nHowever, the song that really made an impact on audiences was the rap hit "Gangsta\'s Paradise" by Coolio, which played during the end credits. The song, which featured a sample from the Stevie Wonder classic "Pastime Paradise," became a massive hit, topping the charts in several countries and earning Coolio a Grammy Award.\n\nThe success of "Gangsta\'s Paradise" was a boost for "Batman Forever," which had struggled at the box office.

It was also a commercial success, grossing $23.5 million against a production budget of $2.8 million. The film received numerous accolades and nominations, and was nominated twice at the 78th Academy Awards for Best Actor (Howard) and Academy Award for Best Original Song for Three 6 Mafia's song "It's Hard out Here for a Pimp", winning the latter and becoming the second hip hop song to win an Academy Award, after Eminem's "Lose Yourself."

['In the book of Daniel, King Belshazzar of Babylon hosted a lavish feast for his nobles. During the feast, he ordered that the gold and silver vessels from the temple in Jerusalem be brought to him. As the king and his guests drank wine from the sacred vessels, a disembodied hand appeared and wrote a message on the wall. The king was terrified, and his queen suggested that Daniel be called to interpret the message. Daniel read the words, "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," and explained that they meant "God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end. You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. Your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians." The next day, Belshazzar was killed, and Darius the Mede became king.\n"""\n\n\nIn the Bible, who saw the handwriting on the wall?\n\n\nKing Belshazzar of Babylon saw the handwriting on the wall during a lavish feast he hosted for his nobles.

['The comic strip character known as "Happy Hines" was created by cartoonist Billy DeBeck in 1922. The character was named after heavyweight boxing champion James J. Jeffries, who was known for his happy-go-lucky personality both inside and outside the ring. Jeffries retired from boxing in 1910 and became a successful businessman, but he was best known for his 1910 fight against Jack Johnson, which was billed as the "Battle of the Century." Johnson, who was African American, had become the first black heavyweight champion in 1908, and his victory over Jeffries was seen as a major upset. The fight was also significant because it was the last heavyweight championship fight to take place in the United States until 1936. After his retirement from boxing, Jeffries became a popular figure in the entertainment industry, appearing in films and on the vaudeville stage. He also served as a spokesman for various products and was a frequent guest on radio shows. When DeBeck created "Happy Hines," he named the character after Jeffries in honor of his friendly and approachable personality. The character was a popular fixture in newspapers for many years, and he was known for his humorous observations on life and society.', 'What comic strip character was named after heavyweight boxing champion James J.

  Skippy is an American comic strip written and drawn by Percy Crosby that was published from 1923 to 1945. A highly popular, acclaimed and influential feature about rambunctious fifth-grader Skippy Skinner, his friends and his enemies, it was adapted into movies, a novel and a radio show. It was commemorated on a 1997 U.S. Postal Service stamp and was the basis for a wide range of merchandising—although perhaps the most well-known product bearing the Skippy name, Skippy peanut butter, used the name without Crosby's authorization, leading to a protracted trademark conflict. An early influence on cartoonist Charles Schulz and an inspiration for his Peanuts, Skippy is considered one of the classics of the form. In Vanity Fair, humorist Corey Ford described it as "America's most important contribution to humor of the century", while comics historian John A. Lent wrote,

  John Lawrence Sullivan (October 15, 1858 – February 2, 1918), known simply as John L. among his admirers, and dubbed the "Boston Strong Boy" by the press, was an American boxer recognized as the first heavyweight champion of gloved boxing, de facto reigning from February 7, 1882, to September 7, 1892. He is also generally recognized as the last heavyweight champion of bare-knuckle boxing under the London Prize Ring Rules, being a cultural icon of the late 19th century America, arguably the first boxing superstar and one of the world's highest-paid athletes of his era. Newspapers' coverage of his career, with the latest accounts of his championship fights often appearing in the headlines, and as cover stories, gave birth to sports journalism in the United States and set the pattern internationally for covering boxing events in media, and photodocumenting the prizefights.

  In the 1930s, the Alameda, California, food packer Rosefield Packing Co., Ltd. began to sell its newly developed hydrogenated peanut butter, which it labeled "Skippy" without Crosby's permission. Percy Crosby had the trademark invalidated in 1934, but Rosefield persisted after Crosby was committed to an asylum, and its successor companies, including Unilever and Hormel (owner since 2013), were granted rights to the trademark over the objection of Crosby's heirs. Years of expensive litigation followed, which Crosby's heirs have continued into the 2000s.

  The strip focused on Skippy Skinner, a young boy living in the city. Usually wearing an enormous collar and tie and a floppy checked hat, he was an odd mix of mischief and melancholy who might equally be found stealing from the corner fruit stand, failing to master skates or baseball, complaining about the adult world, or staring sadly at an old relative's grave ("And only last year she gave me a tie"). The syndicated strip was enormously popular, at one point guaranteeing Crosby $2,350 a week, more than the United States president. Skippy had several topper strips on the Sunday page: Always Belittlin' (Oct 17, 1926 - 1940), Comic Letter (April 22 - Sept 16, 1934) and Bug Lugs (Feb 17 - Aug 18, 1935). During the World War II years, Crosby's conservative politics increasingly intruded on the strip, and it began to lose readers. Negotiations on a new contract failed, and Crosby ended Skippy in 1945. Crosby's final years were tragic; he was unable to find steady work and drifted into alcoholism. After a 1949 suicide attempt, he was placed in the asylum at Kings Park, New York, where he died in 1964, unable to secure release.

  Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913December 26, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 38th president of the United States from 1974 to 1977. Earlier, he served as the leader of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives, and then as the 40th vice president of the United States from 1973 to 1974. When President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, Ford succeeded to the presidency, but was defeated for election to a full term in 1976.

  in the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a lieutenant commander. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the U.S. representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the House minority leader. In December 1973, two months after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. To date, this was the last intra-term U.S. presidential succession. As president, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, which marked

Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. presidency. Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and captain of the football team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the Grand Rapids City League.

  Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Surveys of historians and political scientists have ranked Ford as a below-average president. Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. After experiencing a series of health problems, he died at home on December 26, 2006.

  When speaking of his mother and stepfather, Ford said that "My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing." Ford had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (1925–1980).

He was the only child of Dorothy Ayer Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader. His father was the son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James.

Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure. In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a presidential pardon to Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the president. In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president. Ford became vice president as the Watergate scandal was unfolding.

  Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930. Ford later said that his biological father had a history of hitting his mother. In a biography of Ford, James M. Cannon wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents was sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidants that his father had first hit his mother when she had smiled at another man during their honeymoon. After living with her parents for two-and-a-half years, on February 1, 1917, Gardner married Gerald Rudolff Ford, a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company.

  The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover is the twelfth album release by Michael Nyman and the ninth to feature the Michael Nyman Band. The album includes the first commercially released recording of Nyman's composition "Memorial". There is some music not included on the soundtrack album: the love theme for Michael and Georgina, which is "Fish Beach" from Drowning by Numbers, the song performed as a show in the restaurant, sung by actress and singer Flavia Brilli, or a doubly pulsed variation of "Memorial" that occurs about halfway through the film. Edits of "Memorial" appear throughout the film, with the entire twelve-minute movement accompanying the final scene and end credits, but one variation is uniquely created for the film.

The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering. Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used pop music and other Oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like "On the Road Again" and "Try a Little Tenderness" were integrated in the film's score.

Simon & Garfunkel's producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, releasing it as a single that eventually went to No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts. Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was "horrified" when he first heard it. The success of "The Sound of Silence" drew Simon back to the United States to reunite with Garfunkel. Together they recorded four more albums: Sounds of Silence;

Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing "Mrs. Robinson", Simon originally toyed with the title "Mrs. Roosevelt". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, "Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!" Simon and Garfunkel returned to the UK in the fall of 1968 and did a church concert appearance at Kraft Hall, which was broadcast on the BBC, and also featured Paul's brother Ed

It was the first such institution in the United States and lasted just two years. He also founded what quickly became the city's most prominent music publishing concern.

['The last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin was Rudolf Hess, the former deputy leader of the Nazi party, who was imprisoned there from 1941 until his death in 1987. Hess was arrested in 1941 and charged with war crimes, but he was never tried due to his deteriorating mental health. He was held in Spandau until his death at the age of 93. The prison was demolished in 1987, and the site is now a park.\n\nSpandau jail was a high-security prison located in Berlin, Germany. It was built in 1878 and was used to hold political prisoners, including members of the Nazi party. The prison was known for its harsh conditions and strict regime. During World War II, the prison was used to hold high-ranking Nazi officials, including Rudolf Hess.\n\nAfter the war, the prison was used to hold Nazi war criminals, including Hermann Göring, who was the last inmate to be released in 1946. The prison was closed in 1947, and the remaining prisoners were transferred to other facilities.\n\nIn 1966, Rudolf Hess was transferred to Spandau jail, where he remained until his death in 1987. Hess was the last inmate of Spandau jail', 'Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?']

  Cherry brought him to the attention of Texas independent producer Paul Short. With financing from Texas theater owners and the children's charitable organization Variety Clubs International, Short cast Murphy in Bad Boy to help promote the charity's work with troubled children. Murphy performed well in the screen test, but Steve Broidy, president of the project's production company Allied Artists did not want to cast someone in a major role with so little acting experience. Cherry, Short, and the theater owners refused to finance the film unless Murphy played the lead. The 1933 Thames Williamson novel The Woods Colt caught Murphy's attention during this period of his career. He secured the rights to the

He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production. He moved into Terry Hunt's Athletic

  Murphy played Jim Harvey, whose horse Tumbleweed displayed a talent for getting the hero out of any scrape. Director Nathan Juran oversaw Tumbleweed, as well as Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River. As Murphy's film career began to progress, so did his efforts to improve his skills. He continually practiced his fast draw with a gun. When Hugh O'Brian bet $500 that he could draw a gun faster than anyone in Hollywood, Murphy raised the ante to $2500 and wanted to use live ammunition; O'Brian did not accept. He took both private and classroom acting lessons from Estelle Harman, and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.

  Murphy became a national celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's "most decorated soldier" in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover brought him to the attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, "[Murphy was] in such a nervous condition that I was afraid he might jump out of

The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail.

This is one of the thirty-five juvenile novels that comprise the Winston Science Fiction set, which novels were published in the 1950s for a readership of teen-aged boys. The typical protagonist in these books was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers. In this story Ron Barron is typical in having a ham radio set up in a shed in the back yard of his parents' house.

Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture.

  Mark Anderson (born August 13, 1967) is an American journalist and book author. He has written articles on science, history, and technology for a variety of national and international publications and media outlets. He has a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in astrophysics. Anderson's first book, "Shakespeare" by Another Name (Gotham Books, 2005), supports the Oxfordian theory that the Elizabethan court poet-playwright Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford wrote the works conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare. The book is the first Oxfordian literary biography – connecting de Vere's life to Shakespeare's plays and poems. Anderson's second book, The Day the World Discovered the Sun (Da Capo Press, 2012), covers the historical adventures involved in, and the build-up surrounding, the 1761 and 1769 transits of Venus. The book details, in addition to the myriad far-flung voyages to record the transits, the critical leaps in progress made in oceanic navigation, and in astronomical calculations such as the precise distance from the earth to the sun, during this fruitful period. The book won the USA Best Book Award in the History: General category in 2013.
