Situational code-switching, style shifting and code-alternation occur continuously, seamlessly in communication between all Jamaicans of all classes and in all situations, in all speech acts. Recently, Jamaican patois has gone through a process of decreolization, similar to that which happened with AAVE due to the basilect creole variety developing \n\n the acrolect English. It is important to note that for all practical purposes, English is Jamaica's native language. When the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century Jamaica was linguistically a blank slate. Jamaican patois \n\n is a mixture of English and an adaptation that English took in the new environment of the Caribbean when it became mixed with the other imported languages. It is here that nation language becomes of use to the Caribbean poet: \"It is \n\n into being when the island's burgeoning sugar industry created a large demand for field labour. The incoming African slave labourers—who spoke many various languages themselves—and the English speaking plantocracy communicated through the formation of a contact creole language unique to Jamaica. Today we know this creole as patois, and even those Jamaicans who don't speak it on a daily basis can speak it fluently, and fully understand it. Standard English is taught in Jamaican schools, although teachers may speak to pupils and their parents in patois outside of the classroom.\n\nQuestion: what does jamaican people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Chiune Sugihara was bestowed the honor of the Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1985. Inuzuka's help in rescuing Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe was acknowledged by the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States which saved him from being tried as a war criminal.

Not finding him at home Okuzaki settled for shooting Koshimizu's son, who was seriously wounded. It is then stated that Okuzaki was sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for attempted murder. In his later years, Horiuchi suffered from stomach cancer - which had killed his father - but surgery to eradicate it was successful.

In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: \"'I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat one beats the one in D for difficulty.'\" Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \"grand\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble. 450 is a concertante work for piano and orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The concerto is scored for solo piano, flute (third movement only), two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra. The earliest known English horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann \n\n 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The concerto is in three movements:  Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. It is known that Milling's concerti were performed in 1782 by the Italian oboist Giovanni Palestrini.\n\nQuestion: who did mozart write his four horn concertos for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Beginning in August 1914 with the invasion of neutral Belgium, the country was almost completely overrun by German troops before the winter of the same year as the Allied forces withdrew westwards. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west. Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded. However, they could do little against the 1.5 million-strong German invading force. Between August and October 1914, the Germans took the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and occupied \n\n overwhelm the Belgian military and then move quickly through the country and then towards Paris. On 2 August 1914, following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised.

Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him. While campaigning, Kennedy was assassinated shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After Kennedy's assassination, the Democratic party nominated Vice president Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right.

In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination.

In 2008, after the opening of 7 brand new nuclear reactors in Japan (3 on Honshū, and 1 each on Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Tanegashima) Japan became the third largest nuclear power user in the world with 55 nuclear reactors. Following an earthquake, tsunami, and the failure of cooling systems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on March 11, 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. 140,000 residents within 20 km of the plant were evacuated. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused a loss of electric power at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. Radioactive materials were released from the plant to the atmosphere and to the ocean. About one third of reactors in the US are boiling water reactors, the same technology which was involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. There are also eight nuclear power plants located along the seismically active West coast.

Since 2007, in areas of Canada and the United States of America in which it is used, daylight saving time begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. In the United Kingdom, railroads gradually switched to Greenwich Mean Time (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone. In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour. This has resulted in three time zones becoming five during the daylight-saving period. South Australia time becomes UTC+10:30, called Central Daylight Time (CDT), possibly with \"Australia\" prefixed (ACDT). The time in the southeastern states becomes UTC+11:00, using \"Eastern\" in the time zone name, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), respectively Australia Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT). Of the states that observe DST, most began on the last Sunday in October, and ended on the last Sunday in March, until 2007.\n\nQuestion: what is my timezone in louisiana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Kennedy delivered an impromptu speech on race reconciliation to a mostly African-American crowd in a poor inner-city Indianapolis neighborhood. Malcolm X, an African American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a popular figure during the civil rights movement, was assassinated in Manhattan, New York City on February21, 1965. While preparing to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity at the Audubon Ballroom in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, Malcolm X was shot multiple times and killed.

Edgar Allan Poe (40), American writer, editor, and literary critic, died on 7 October 1849, under circumstances that remain mysterious. On 3 October 1849 he was found delirious in Baltimore, Maryland, \"in great distress, and ... in need of immediate assistance\", according to the man who \n\n Poe was born in San Carlos City, Pangasinan, and later had six children by his second wife, Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Gatbonton Kelley (November 8, 1917 – March 2, 1999) of Pampanga: Elizabeth (Liz), Ronald Allan (Ronnie or FPJ), Fernando II (Andy), Genevieve (Jenny), Fredrick (Freddieboy), and Evangeline (Eva). Poe died in 1951 while working on a film, after he had permitted a rabid puppy to lick his wound. In January of that year, Poe's wife Virginia had died in New York of tuberculosis. It is assumed that the poem was inspired by her death. It is difficult to discern, however, if Poe had intended the completed poem to be published or if it was personal. This article lists all known poems by American author and critic Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849), listed alphabetically with the date of their authorship in parentheses.

It was applied to solid rubber tires, rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939. The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process. A US patent to Goodyear also claimed sipes improve tire traction, and tend to close completely in \n\n brought to a halt, forced to repair their machines by the roadside. The cycling historian Raymond Henry says repairs before Rustin's invention were made by cutting a patch from a discarded air tube, scraping it with a file, then cleaning it with petrol. Research ended with the start of World War I in 1914. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive.

The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. After the stunningly quick defeat in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. ; 15 June — World War II: Verdun falls to German forces. ; 17 June — A Luftwaffe Junkers 88 bomber sinks the British ship RMS Lancastria, which was evacuating troops from near Saint-Nazaire, France, killing some 5,800 men. ; 21 June — World War II: Vichy France and Germany sign an armistice at Compiegne, in the same wagon-lit railroad car used by Marshal Ferdinand Foch to accept the surrender of Germany in 1918. ; 23 June — World War II: German leader Adolf Hitler surveys newly defeated Paris in now occupied France.

Most populated places in the country are in the UTC−03:00 zone in the winter (UTC−02:00 in the summer). Pituffik/Thule Air Base uses UTC−04:00 and United States conventions on DST because it is a US air base, meaning it is part of the Atlantic Time Zone. Most of Saskatchewan, despite geographically being in the Mountain Time Zone, observes year-round Central Standard Time (CST). In 2020, the Yukon Territory abandoned seasonal time change to permanently observe year-round Mountain Standard Time (MST). The territory of Nunavut comprises three time zones: Mountain Time in the west, Central Time in the centre and Eastern Time in the east. UTC is a discontinuous time scale. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated UT2. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.\n\nQuestion: what timezone is utah in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to Travis Zadeh, while various elite Islamic religious factions in various geographical and historical context did contest and probed into  beliefs and practices that were assumed to be superstitious, still, Quranic charms, belief in jinn, and visiting tombs of prophets and \n\n and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.

Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon \n\n noted that radioactivity continued after the neutron emissions ceased. Not only had they discovered a new form of radioactive decay in the form of positron emission, they had transmuted an element into a hitherto unknown radioactive isotope of another, thereby inducing radioactivity where there had been none before. Chadwick noted that being electrically neutral, neutrons would be able to penetrate the nucleus more easily than protons or alpha particles. Hahn suggested a bursting of the nucleus, but he was unsure of what the physical basis for the results were. They reported their findings by mail to Meitner in Sweden, who a few months earlier had fled Nazi Germany. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and \n\n All consideration of nuclear electrons ended with James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932.\n\nQuestion: what did the scientist chadwick discovered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably 1984, as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire. Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in Animal Farm and 1984.

When Cole Younger returned from a mission to California, he learned that Quantrill and Anderson had both been killed. It was likely Clement who, amid the tumult of Reconstruction in Missouri, turned the guerrillas into outlaws. In December 1881, Wood Hite was killed by Liddil in an argument over Martha Bolton, the sister of the Fords. On February 11, 1882, James Timberlake arrested Wood Hite's brother Clarence, who made a confession but died of tuberculosis in prison. Ford, on the other hand, agreed to bring down Jesse James in return for the reward. On April 3, 1882, Ford fatally shot Jesse James behind the ear at James's rented apartment in St. Joseph, \n\n they re-enact the shooting, but people soon gradually become hostile towards the pair, hailing Jesse as a legend and calling Bob a \"coward.\" The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a 2007 American epic revisionist Western film written and directed by Andrew Dominik. Adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same title, the film dramatizes the relationship between Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), focusing on the events that lead up to the titular killing. On December 7, 1869, Frank and Jesse James are believed to have robbed the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin, Missouri. Jesse is suspected of having shot down the cashier, John W. Sheets, in the mistaken belief that he was Samuel P. Cox, the Union militia officer who had ambushed and killed \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson during the Civil War.\n\nQuestion: what was jesse james killed with?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Frémont, who eventually dropped out of the race after brokering a deal with Lincoln) and the War Democrats (the minority of Democrats who backed Lincoln's prosecution of the war, as opposed to the Peace Democrats, or Copperheads, who favored a negotiated settlement with the Confederates). Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy. To sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution \n\n at which he drank heavily. Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, then went to his own swearing-in outside the Capitol, and delivered his acclaimed Second Inaugural Address. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.

Under the leadership of Russian communist Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik Party seized power in the Russian Republic during a coup known as the October Revolution. Ruling by decree, Lenin’s Sovnarkom introduced widespread reforms confiscating land for redistribution among the permitting non-Russian nations to declare themselves independent, improving labour rights, and increasing access to education. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. Eventually crushing all opponents, the RCP spread Soviet style rule quickly and established itself through all of Russia. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the RCP, became Lenin's successor and continued as leader of the Soviet Union into the 1950s. He served as head of state of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later of the Soviet Union from 1919 to 1946. From 1926, he was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

He underwent surgery and radiation treatments several times. Hoffman's parents then consulted Boston Children's Hospital for a second opinion. In October 2013, Hoffman's father reported that an MRI revealed that the remaining tumor was the same size as in an MRI done in June 2013, indicating that it was not growing. As of April 2014, his cancer was still in remission. He was diagnosed with malignant pheochromocytoma, a rare, fatal form of adrenal cancer. Kubby underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 1968, 1975 and 1976. This last time, his medical records show that the cancer had metastasised to his liver and beyond. All other patients with this diagnosis have had a 100% mortality rate within five years. His physician, Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, a specialist from the USC School of Medicine, monitored his condition and treated him with conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, until referring him to the Mayo Clinic in 1981 for yet another surgery and radiation. For the next 25 years, Kubby claimed to control the symptoms of his disease solely by smoking marijuana and by maintaining a healthy diet.

The fiercest fighting of the battle—and the second bloodiest day of the Civil War—occurred on May 3 as Lee launched multiple attacks against the Union position at Chancellorsville. That same day, John Sedgwick advanced across the Rappahannock River, defeated the small Confederate \n\n to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek.

Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the Tallapoosa River. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee.

The couple were by now experiencing serious financial problems, (Pratt had already borrowed money from a friend, Mrs Montagu and attempted to borrow money from Samuel Johnson ) and, on 29 January 1778, the day after receiving Franklin's response to Melmoth's poem, Pratt wrote to Franklin asking to borrow money from him, which \n\n agreed to.

Although her diagnosis was withheld from her by Juan, he knew she was not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical. Only a few months after \"the Renunciation\", Evita secretly underwent a radical hysterectomy, performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack, of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in an attempt to eradicate her advanced cervical cancer. In 2011, a Yale neurosurgeon, Daniel E. Nijensohn, studied Evita's skull x-rays and photographic evidence and said that Perón may have been given a prefrontal lobotomy in the last months of her life, \"...to relieve the pain, agitation and anxiety she suffered in the final months of her illness.\" In 1952, shortly before her death from cancer at 33, Eva Perón was given the title of \"Spiritual Leader of the Nation\" by the Argentine Congress. Eva Perón has become a part of international popular culture, most famously as the subject of the musical Evita (1976). Evita was by this point so ill that she was unable to stand without support. María Eva Duarte de Perón (7 May 1919 – 26 July 1952), better known as just Eva Perón or by the nickname Evita, was an Argentine actress, politician, activist, and philanthropist who served as First Lady of Argentina from June 1946 until her death in July 1952, as the wife of Argentine President, Juan Domingo Perón (1895–1974).

It developed to the north through \n\n Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam. At the temple, he met the Buddhist monk Moggaliputta Tissa, and became more devoted to the Buddhist faith. This legend about Ashoka's search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why Ashoka did not adopt Jainism, another major contemporary faith that advocates non-violence and compassion.

Alexandra had, in fact, encouraged the composer to make Kamenka his second home. His affection for the estate bore fruit in his using local songs in the symphony he was writing. He even once wrote, in jest, that true credit for the Little Russian's finale should have gone \"to the real composer of the said work&mdash;Peter Gerasimovich.\" One of Tchaikovsky's favorite anecdotes resulted from his nearly losing the sketches for the Little Russian on the way back to Moscow. All but one he transcribed himself came from the collections of Villebois and Balakirev. Tchaikovsky was born in Vyatka. He spent the first part of his life on his mother's estate, and studied at a public school at Vyatka and later on in St. Petersburg.

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996. The \"sharp s\" (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie (Peter Lang, 2006). Until 1918, the spoken standard in Austria was the Schönbrunner Deutsch, a sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg family and the nobility of Austria-Hungary. The dialect was similar to Viennese German and other eastern dialects of German spoken in Austria, but was slightly nasalized. In fact, in cities such as Hanover and Berlin, the dialect started disappearing with the exception of a small minority of Low German speakers that only make up 5 million people.\n\nQuestion: which countries speak german officially?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, Abbey Road Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with supporting musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner. The composition, credited to Lennon–McCartney, was created primarily by John Lennon with assistance from Yoko Ono and George Harrison. Lennon said he was trying to paint a picture of a revolution using sound. The composition was influenced by the avant-garde style of Ono as well as the musique concrète works of composers such as Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen. The recording began as an extended ending to the album version of Lennon's song \"Revolution\". Musically, Lennon plays his guitar gently, applying tremolo, in an effect that Jackson states matches \"the soothing reassurance of the lyrics.\" Recorded at EMI Studios on 30 September 1970, Lennon took 32 takes experimenting with different approaches before hitting on this one. However, music critics Wilfrid Mellers and Johnny Rogan state that other elements of the music create some tension with the reassuring message. These elements include Ringo Starr's \"jittery\" drumming, with many silences, and the fragmented vocal melody, which break up the sentences of the lyrics. a Chuck Berry-styled rocker that details the Lennons' early months in their new home, as well as \"John Sinclair\", his musical plea for Sinclair's release from a ten-year sentence for giving two marijuana joints to an undercover policewoman. Together, Lennon and Ono lament police brutality in \"Attica State\", the hardships of war-torn Northern Ireland in \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"The Luck of the Irish\" (see Bloody Sunday (1972) article), and pay tribute to Angela Davis with \"Angela\".\n\nQuestion: what type of music did john lennon sing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The court concluded that Denmark had sovereignty of the whole island of Greenland, ending Norwegian control over Eric The Red's Land. Norway formerly included the provinces Jämtland, Härjedalen, Idre-Särna (lost since the Second Treaty of Brömsebro), and Bohuslän (lost since the Treaty of Roskilde), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the Thirty Years' War and Second Northern War. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  (LGBT) rights in Greenland are some of the most extensive in the Americas and the world, relatively similar to those in Denmark proper in Europe. In 1979, Denmark granted Greenland home rule and in 2009 extended self-government, although it still influences the island's culture and politics. Greenland is considered to be very socially liberal towards LGBT people. Based in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, the organization was founded on 19 July 1989 by the Government of Greenland.

Several Soviet Socialist Republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The process began with growing unrest in the Union's various constituent national republics developing into an incessant political and legislative conflict between them and the central government. The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed in the last quarter of 1991. Furthermore, the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet Union's federative system—that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples – eased the task of secession and independence. On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\".

In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species.

There have recently been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings dating back to c. 6000 BC, like Jiahu Script, Banpo Script, but whether or not the carvings are complex enough to qualify as writing is under debate. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script.

Immediately after Abraham's encounter with God, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and Ishmael (age 13), circumcised. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a concubine named Keturah, by whom he had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. According to the Bible, reflecting the change of his name to \"Abraham\" meaning \"a father of many nations\", Abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the Bible, among others the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Edomites, Amalekites, Kenizzites, Midianites and Assyrians, and through his nephew Lot he was also related to the Moabites and Ammonites. Abraham lived to see his son marry Rebekah, and to see the birth of his twin grandsons Jacob and Esau. He died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was \"an hundred years old\", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. Haran is the father of Lot, who is Abram's nephew; the entire family live in Ur of the Chaldees. In Jewish tradition, Abraham is called Avraham Avinu (אברהם אבינו), \"our father Abraham,\" signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת). Ḥanan b.

Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson wrote the lyrics for the Norwegian national anthem \"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\". On 13 August 2021, Hnamte released a music video Jana Gana Mana, the national anthem of India, on Youtube. The hymn was written in the 8th century CE by Adi Sankara, a revered Hindu philosopher, theologian and Jagad Guru(Master to the world). One day, as a young boy, he was on bhiksha for alms to prepare his lunch and happened upon the doorstep of a very poor Brahmin lady. Sankara was so moved by the incredible kindness and selflessness of this woman that he burst forth into poetry and sang 22 stanzas in praise of Goddess Lakshmi. Pleased by the beauty and power of the hymn, \n\n Tana Mana is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar, originally credited to \"the Ravi Shankar Project\" and released in 1987. The album is an experimental work by Shankar, mixing traditional instrumentation with 1980s electronic music and sampling technology. Shankar recorded much of Tana Mana in 1983 with sound effects innovator Frank Serafine, but it remained unreleased until Peter Baumann, head of new age record label Private Music, became attached to the project. The album also includes contributions from Lakshmi Shankar, Aashish Khan and Kumar Bose, and Western musicians such as George Harrison, Al Kooper and Ray Cooper. It was written – ironically – to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised form of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata that Tagore composed.\n\nQuestion: who wrote the jana gana mana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956. She wrote her first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1916. Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. Most of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. Christie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\". These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.

The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK in the mid-late 1970s identified the need for defining higher-level protocols. The UK National Computing Centre publication 'Why Distributed Computing', which was based on extensive research into future potential configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. Hubert Zimmermann, and Charles Bachman as chairman, played a key role in the development of the Open Systems Interconnections reference model. The drafters of the reference model had to contend with many competing priorities and interests.

His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. Renowned his charismatic \n\nLouis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 - July 6), singer and trumpeter ; Charlie Shavers (August 3, 1920 – July 8), trumpet player ; Wynton Kelly (December 2, 1931 — April 12), pianist \n\n Henderson, Carter again, and Count Basie. He and drummer Johnny Otis collaborated often, and in 1960 Washington worked with Joe Darensbourg. While not a path-breaking major figure, Washington was a consistently inventive soloist whose fine work can be heard not only with the Blue Rhythm Band but with Armstrong's late 1930s' band and Count Basie. In New York, Washington studied under Walter Damrosch at the New York Conservatory, playing with various ensembles in the late 1920s. From 1937 to 1943, he played in Louis Armstrong's orchestra. After his tenure with Armstrong he moved to the West Coast, and played with \n\n presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.

The first possible relocation to Santa Gertrudis, and the one having the least historical support, followed a fire in the 1790s that destroyed the first Mission church.

On 25 July 1943, a coup d'état took place against Mussolini to overthrow the Fascist regime. The new Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio, however, secretly signed the armistice of Cassibile with Allied Powers on 3 September 1943, while all of Italy was directly under German military influence. On 8 September, with a proclamation, Pietro Badoglio announced the switching allegiances from the Axis to the Allies, after which he fled to Brindisi with the royal family and the government, leaving military and public authorities without orders. Following this, Britain, Italy, and the rest of the Allied Nations won the First World War. During that war, British intelligence subsidized Benito Mussolini's activism. Initially the King and his staff (conscious of the Italian lack of preparation to war) did not approve Mussolini's intentions, but when France was clearly defeated in June 1940, the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was abruptly sent to war. Mussolini made the mistake to believe that Britain would accept peace agreements with the Axis after France's surrender, and did not anticipate a long lasting war.\n\nQuestion: who was the italian leader in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After the Economist Group acquired CQ and merged it with Roll Call, Hawkings was assigned to edit the company’s first new product, the online and email Daily Briefing. The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but, whereas the book is solely an explanation of cosmology, the film is, additionally, a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with some of his family members and colleagues. In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\" For four years starting in 1982, Hawkings covered federal courts and city hall, was a metro section columnist and then an assistant city editor for the San Antonio Light.\n\nQuestion: what did stephen hawking become famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as Flemish), and French is spoken by 40%. Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. In the 1880s, a Walloon \n\n While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried took some measures to encourage assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for either language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. In 1846, 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921.

After the war and devastation of its European and Asian rivals, the United States found itself in a uniquely powerful position due to its enormous economic and military power.

Intimism was most notably practiced by French painters Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard after the 1899 disbandment of Les Nabis. Edgar Degas and Felix Vallotton have also been characterized as intimists. French art critic Camille Mauclair defined Intimism as: \"a revelation of the soul through the things painted, the magnetic suggestion of what lies behind them through the description of the outer appearance, the intimate meaning of the spectacles of life\" While the movement is often associated with Impressionism, the Intimists diverged from the Impressionists in abandoning a focus on formal accuracy in depiction of light, color, and perspective in favor of emphasized texture, exaggerated palette, and merged figure and ground. The term \"intimism\" has since been extended to artists outside of the historical period who utilize similar techniques. As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century. Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. Both artists were discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as prince of Andorra, an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. However, according to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The 1905 law on secularity was highly controversial at the time, but today is held as a founding document of French secularism or laïcité. Some French politicians and communities have more recently questioned the law, arguing that, despite its explicit stance for state secularism, it de facto favors traditional French religions, in particular the Catholic Church, at the expense of more recently established religions, such as Islam. With the exception of the historically anomalous Alsace-Lorraine, followers of Islam and other religions more recently implanted in France instead have to build and maintain religious facilities at their own expense.

Greenstone notes another set of events that influenced the content and the very language of the George series: by the late 1950s the Dr. Seuss books were being published, with their simplified vocabulary to aid the teaching of phonics; at that time also the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite promoted doubts about America's education system. Margret Rey later acknowledged that this simplification had been a mistake. Theodor Seuss Geisel created the artwork for this campaign, years before he started writing the children's books that made him famous as Dr. Seuss.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. The Iroquois Confederation led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes and Iroquoian-speaking Huron and related tribes of the Great Lakes region. They sought refuge west and north of Lake Michigan. Eastern tribes such as the Lakotas were pushed across the Mississippi onto the Great Plains in the early 18th century, where they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing tribes in the region. they began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River.

Holworthy Hall, in Harvard Yard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a historic dormitory for first-year students at Harvard College. What was originally called HarvardColledge [sic] (around which Harvard University eventually grew) held its first Commencement in September 1642, when nine degrees were conferred. Several hundred Harvard honorary degrees (which with few exceptions must be accepted in person) have been awarded \n\n Massachusetts Hall is the oldest surviving building at Harvard College, the first institution of higher learning in the British colonies in America, and second oldest academic building in the United States after the Wren Building at the College of William & Mary. Massachusetts Hall was designed by Harvard Presidents John Leverett and his successor Benjamin Wadsworth. It was erected between 1718 and 1720 in Harvard Yard. Much of the interior woodwork and hardware, including brass doorknobs, disappeared \n\n Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.

Some literature remains overtly political, Laos being one of the few remaining communist states is caught in a balancing act between China, Thailand and Vietnam, and all three have a history of mutual distrust stronger than cooperation. Yet, the economic power of China and its increasing nationalistic image remain a model for Muang Lao's communist regime. Relations have consisted of trade and aid, largely focused on road construction in the northern provinces of Laos, without directly challenging the interests of Thailand or Vietnam in the central and southern regions. It is much less common than in neighbouring Thailand. In addition to these, there are many prostitutes in Laos from China and Vietnam, while some Laotian women go to Thailand to work as sex workers. Laos has been identified as a source country for women and girls trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation in Thailand. Many female sex workers in Laos are at high risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and disease. The people of Laos have a rich literary tradition dating back at least six hundred years, with the oral and storytelling traditions of its peoples dating back much earlier. In Laos today there are over forty-seven recognized ethnic groups, with the Lao Loum comprising the majority group. As an inland crossroads of Southeast Asia the political history of Laos has been complicated by frequent warfare and colonial conquests by European and regional rivals. As a result, Laos today has cultural influence from France, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia.\n\nQuestion: where is laos in world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. Central Colorado is home to most of the population of the state and its geography is dominated by the Rocky Mountains, their foothills, mesas, and canyons, the rivers that run through them, and the open plains off the foothills. It flows west to east starting in Colorado and dumping into the Mississippi River. Its length of 1,469 miles allows it to flow through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. This is a list of drainage basins in the U.S. State of Colorado. East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way.

Migrations of Germanic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating in the eventual collapse of the empire in the West in 476, replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of Europe. During the Crisis of the Third Century, the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. Roman civilisation is often grouped into \"classical antiquity\" with ancient Greece, a civilisation that inspired much of the culture of ancient Rome. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of law, war, art, literature, architecture, and language in the Western world, and its history continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilisation came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe.

A federal government is formed when a group of political units, such as states or provinces join together in a federation, delegating their individual sovereignty and many powers to the central government while retaining or reserving other limited powers. As a result, two or more levels of government exist within an established geographic territory. The body of law of the common central government is the federal law. Examples of federal governments include those of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Pakistan, Republic of India, Russia, the former Soviet Union and the United States. Analogously to the US federal government, it is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The state is also divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. It is the world’s first federal democratic republic founded on the consent of the governed.

The southern states, however, have net gain in population and Germany as the economic powerhouse of the EU is attracting immigrants overall. Until the early 19th century Germany, a federation of numerous states of varying size and development, retained its pre-industrial character, where trade centered around a number of free cities.

The glider was designed with wing-warping capability for full-size testing of the concept first tried on the 1899 Wright Kite. On 23 September 1900, Wilbur wrote from Kitty Hawk, \"My idea is merely to experiment and practice with a view to solving the problem of equilibrium. When the Wright brothers made the world's first sustained heavier-than-air flight, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the Wright Flyer during 1903, was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner. During 1913, Igor Sikorsky developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the Russky Vityaz.\n\nQuestion: when did the wright brothers created their first plane?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since Seychelles' independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, small-scale manufacturing and most recently the offshore sector. There are four sovereign island nations located in the Indian Ocean: Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles. The Spanish settled the largest island of the Indian Ocean (and the fourth-largest globally), Madagascar, along with a group of smaller islands nearby, namely Réunion and the Comoros. The British also held a number of island colonies in the region, including the extended archipelago of Seychelles and the rich farming island of Mauritius, previously under the French sovereignty. ; The largest intact coco de mer forest and many other endemic trees, plants and animals. Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF) manages and protects the World Heritage Sites of Aldabra and Vallee de Mai. Aldabra and Vallee de Mai are both unique, and represent the rich natural heritage of Seychelles. Located to the north east of Madagascar, east of Zanzibar and south of Socotra, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it has clear water and scenery which can be perceived as beautiful, which attracts a large portion of Praslin's tourists.

Some Seneca also live with other Iroquois peoples on the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario. The Seneca Nation has three reservations, two of which are occupied: Cattaraugus Reservation, Allegany Indian Reservation, and the mostly unpopulated Oil Springs Reservation. It has two alternating capitals on the two occupied reservations: Irving at Cattaraugus Reservation, and Jimerson Town near Salamanca on the Allegany Reservation. In the Seneca language the people are known as O-non-dowa-gah, (pronounced: Oh-n'own-dough-wahgah) or \"Great Hill People.\" The historical Seneca occupied territory throughout the Finger Lakes area in Central New York, and in the Genesee Valley \n\n The government of this tribe was established in 1848 by a Constitutional Convention of Seneca Indians residing on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Territories in present-day New York. The Seneca Nation of Indians Constitution established a tri-partite governing structure based on general elections of 16 Councilors, three Executives (President, Treasurer, Clerk), and Court justices (Surrogates and Peacemakers). The famous Great Indian Warpath, known locally as the \"Seneca Trail\", followed the Potomac River, allowing the Algonquian, Tuscarora, and Seneca nations to transit the area for purposes of trade and war. Excavation for the building of the present Seneca Rocks Visitor Center uncovered evidence of two villages, the more recent of which thrived about 700 years ago.

Arthur in 1882. Taft had a reputation for serving political office with integrity and character. While studying law Taft held a tutorship at Yale. Taft did not want to practice law in New York because he believed people were under the corrupting influence of wealth.

Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico. Spanish is the first official language of Puerto Rico, while English is the second official language. Spanish has been an official language in Puerto Rico since it was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. English was introduced as an official language when the United States acquired Puerto Rico as a territory after the Spanish–American War and the Treaty of Paris in 1898.

Chaplin's artistic talent was admired by renowned writers, painters and critics such as Arsène Houssaye, Émile Zola and Théophile Gautier. Édouard Manet felt Chaplin knew \"the smile of a woman\". His works can be viewed in the French museums of Bordeaux, Bayonne, Bourges, Mulhouse, Paris, Reims, Rouen, Saintes (Charente-Maritime), and the Louvre Museum Graphic Art Database. His mother, Olympia Adelle Moisy, was French, whereas his father, John Chaplin, was an art broker from England. Charles Chaplin spent his whole life in France, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1886. Chaplin conducted art classes specifically for women at his studio, including Marie Joséphine Nicolas. The American artist Mary Cassatt, the French artist Louise Abbéma and the English artist Louise Jopling were among Chaplin's students. Chaplin died on 30 January 1891, aged 65, in Paris as a wealthy man and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles. It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting. Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. The breed was created by crossing the English Mastiff with the now extinct Old English Bulldog. It is believed the descendants of these dogs spread throughout Africa with tribal movements, first throughout the Sahara and finally reaching southern Africa around the 6th century AD. The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu (an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high). These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, English Mastiff in 1874, Saint Bernard and German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and Bull Terrier.\n\nQuestion: where do american bulldogs originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In particular, the response of the right wing for using it as justification for social Darwinism and laissez-faire economics (free-market capitalism). Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described himself as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction. ...' From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds is a 2017 book about the origin of human consciousness by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which the author makes a case for a materialist theory of mind, arguing that consciousness is no more mysterious than gravity.

Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with \n\n at any point on Earth with very little power loss. At an 1898 exhibition at Madison Square Garden, Nikola Tesla demonstrated a small unmanned boat that used a coherer based radio control. With an eye towards selling the idea to the US government as a torpedo, Tesla's 1898 patent included a clockwork frequency changer so an enemy couldn't take control of the device. In 1903, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo introduced a radio based control system called the \"Telekino\" at the Paris Academy of Science. In the same year, he obtained a patent in France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States.\n\nQuestion: what was nikola tesla inventions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act, civil asset forfeiture laws, mass surveillance, police checkpoints and militarization of police, while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,  states' rights to determine drug and restroom laws, and federal management of public lands. The most basic features of republicanism anywhere are a representational government in which citizens elect leaders from among themselves for a predefined term, as opposed to a permanent ruling class or aristocracy, and laws are passed by these leaders for the benefit of the entire republic. In addition, unlike a direct or \"pure\" democracy in which the majority vote rules, a republic codifies in a charter or constitution a certain set of basic civil rights that is guaranteed to every citizen and cannot be overridden by majority rule. The American interpretation of \"republicanism\" was inspired by the Whig party in Great Britain which openly criticized \n\n adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives.

The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nQuestion: what is the primary language of china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is replaced by Nikita Khrushchev, who began a period of De-Stalinization. After 1945 Stalin did not directly engage in any wars. Stalin continued his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953. For his role in organizing these deportations, Kruglov was awarded the Order of Suvorov, first degree, which was usually given for exceptional bravery in front-line combat. In January 1944 Kruglov and Vsevolod Merkulov prepared an NKVD report on the Katyn massacre which blamed the massacre on the Germans. Stalin sought to destroy his political rivals while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular a collectivization of agriculture and a development of heavy industry. Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization. Stalin's methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to\n\nQuestion: who was the soviet leader during world war ii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Queensland generated 19.5% of Australia's gross domestic product in the 2008-09 financial year. Queensland's main exports are coal, metals, meat and sugar. In 2006, exports from Queensland totaled A$49.4 billion. During the early 20th century, agricultural produce began to make up a larger share of Australian exports to China, including a growing demand for Australian butter and wheat. Meanwhile, Australian demand for silk and other textiles increased during the early 20th century. World War II disrupted trade between Australia and China. In the post-war decades, wool became an important Australian commodity imported by China. From the 1960s, however, agricultural shortages in China led to heavy imports of Australian wheat. By the early 1970s, China still accounted for only 1% of Australia's merchandise trade flow. Exports to China helped Australia escape the worst effects of the global financial crisis. Many major Australian mining companies rely heavily on China and other growing big economies such as India for exports.\n\nQuestion: which of the following does australia export the most?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bernoskie happened to come upon a burglary in progress at the Miller Pontiac car dealership in Rahway. He was then shot and killed by one of the burglars, either Zarinsky or his cousin Theodore Schiffer. Although Bernoskie shot both suspects, they were able to elude capture. Gerhartsreiter's true identity was revealed after author Edward Savio – with whom Gerhartsreiter briefly lived upon arriving in the United States – contacted the FBI during the manhunt after seeing a photo of \"Clark Rockefeller\" on the news. Police had been seeking Gerhartsreiter since 1985 as a suspect in the disappearance of a married couple in California. Miller was arrested in connection to the shootings. Prior to his arrest, news reports described the suspected gunman as a man in his seventies who was not a Kansas native. Miller was an Aurora, Missouri, transplant from North Carolina, a neo-Nazi, practicing neo-Pagan beliefs, and former politician who founded and formerly led the Carolina Knights, a paramilitary organization with ties to the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, with the organization later being disbanded by the Southern Poverty Law Center, after which he founded another group called the White Patriot Party.

According to tradition, Silwan originated at the time of Saladin in the twelfth century on Ras al-Amud, on the south-west slope  of  the  Mount of Olives,  then in the early twentieth  century, expanding  across  the  Kidron Valley (known to locals as Wadi Sitti Maryam or the Valley of St.Mary) eventually incorporating all of  the Southeast Hill. fortified by the Seleucids, who built the citadel known as Acra. But in Greek any fortification is called an acra, this is a common noun, not a proper one, thus some confusion as to which fortification each specific ancient description is referring to: the refortified City of David, which Ritmeyer identifies as Josephus' southern part of the Lower City, or the Acra proper, the entirely new fortress. As part of this same campaign the armies of Saladin conquered, expelled, enslaved, or killed the remaining Christian communities of Galilee, Samaria, Judea, as well as the coastal towns of Ashkelon, Jaffa, Caesarea, and Acre. In 1997, management of the City of David within the park was assumed by the Ir David Foundation (commonly known as Elad). First suggested in 1920 for this particular area, the term \"City of David\" was used officially from the 1970s onward, following the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel, but today the name with its biblical and political connotations is questioned by some in the archaeological academic community. Since El'Ad took over the management of the park in 1997, 'David's City' has essentially become a religious-nationalist battle cry that has transformed the area from an ordinary Palestinian neighbourhood with a few excavation pits, largely unknown to the Israeli public, into a religious settlement and major national biblical\n\nQuestion: where was the city of david?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century.

Australia used pounds, shillings and pence until 1966, when it adopted the decimal system with the Australian dollar divided into 100 cents. The Australian sixpence circulated from 1910 up until the decimalisation of Australian Currency in 1966. The coins were initially minted in England; however, Australia began to mint their own from the year of 1916 at branches of the Royal Mint in Sydney and Melbourne. The coins which made up Australia's pre-decimal currency were identical to British currency in the characteristics of weight and size. Unique Australian currency was created with decimalisation in 1966. At the time of the sixpence, Australian lives were 'very English'. British coins continued in use until 1910, when Australian silver coins were introduced. The Australian dollar replaced the Australian pound on 14 February 1966 as part of the decimalisation process. In the late 1950s the Decimal Currency committee guided that the Australian government begin to consider to replacement of imperial systems with decimal currency.

Though the Emperor of Japan is supposed to be the direct descendant of Amaterasu Ōmikami, the Shinto sun goddess, all Imperial family members, as well as almost all Japanese, were Buddhists who also practiced Shinto religious rites as well. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan tried to reform its state to resemble a European constitutional monarchy. The Emperor, Buddhism, and Shintoism were officially separated and Shintoism was set as the state religion. The Constitution specifically stated that Emperor is \"holy and inviolable\" (天皇は神聖にして侵すべからず). Some of its powers are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the binding \"advice and approval\" of the Cabinet. Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler. This ancient rite was held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan, until 1990 when the enthronement ceremony for Emperor Akihito took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The ceremony is not public, and the regalia are generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few Shinto priests.

As China’s living standards are rising with the economic growth, Chinese consumers’ shopping habits have changed, more and more consumers are able and willing to spend more on goods and services.

The national GDP for the first quarter of 2020 dropped 6.8% year-on-year, 9.8% quarter on quarter, and the GDP for Hubei Province dropped 39.2% in the same period. China's economic growth has been attributed to financial repression thanks to \"low returns on savings and the cheap loans that it makes possible\". This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed investments for economic growth. However, because low returns also dampens consumer spending, household expenditures account for \"a smaller share of GDP in China than in any other major economy\".

Esther before Ahasuerus is a large painting of 1546–47 by the Venetian painter Tintoretto showing a scene from the Greek addition to the Book of Esther, where Queen Esther faints during a bold intervention with her husband King Ahasuerus of Persia. As described in the Book of Esther, Haman was the son of Hammedatha the Agagite. After Haman was appointed the principal minister of the king Ahasuerus, all of the king's servants were required to bow down to Haman, but Mordechai refused to. Angered by this, and knowing of Mordechai's Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the Jews in the Persian empire killed. The plot was foiled by Queen Esther, the king's recent wife, who was herself a Jew. Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. In the second banquet, she informed the king that Haman was plotting to kill her (and the other Jews). This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther's couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, \n\n On board the ship, traveling to Australia, she met George Johnston, a first lieutenant in the New South Wales Marine Corps, which had accompanied the First Fleet.

St. Paul's was built in 1848 and is the most important example of the Gothic Revival style in Wilkesboro as well as being a typical example of many American Episcopal churches built during the mid nineteenth century. Paul presided over the 50-day trial of the Franklin County moonshine conspiracy, said to be the longest trial in Virginia history to that time. To Paul and his colleagues fell the task of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in desegregation lawsuits in the Western District of Virginia. In August 1956, Paul issued a historic ruling ordering the desegregation of the Charlottesville public schools, and which soon set off Massive Resistance as by-now-United States Senator Harry F. Byrd vehemently disagreed with the United States Supreme Court ruling, and state officials obstructed its implementation. Paul also sat on the 3-judge panel that ordered the integration of the graduate schools of the University of Virginia in the Gregory Swanson case.

It is generally held that the Latins, one of many ancient Italic tribes, adopted the western variant of the Greek alphabet in the 7th century BCE from Cumae, a Greek colony in southern Italy – making the early Latin alphabet one among several Old Italic scripts emerging at the time. The early Latin script was heavily influenced by the then regionally dominant Etruscan civilization; the Latins ultimately adopted 22 of the original 26 Etruscan letters, which derived from Western Greek as well. It is highly probable that the Latins received their alphabet via the Etruscans rather than directly from the Greek colonists. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from Latinus. Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system first spread over the Italian Peninsula with the rise of the Roman Republic from the 4th to the 1st century BCE. During the early and high Middle Ages, the script was spread by Christian missionaries and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems in Central and Northern Europe, and the remainder of the British Isles,. In the Age of Discovery, the first wave of European colonisation saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the Americas and Australia, whereas \n\n The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium. As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture, during the Roman Empire, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic Latin-speaking people and the Latin-speaking people of Italia, Gaul, Hispania and Dacia whose land was settled by Roman colonists.\n\nQuestion: where did the latin language originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala.

In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory. Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven. Judaism teaches something similar – hell is an intense experience of cleansing, more an expression of kindness than a punishment. Fourth-century Christian theologian and Bishop Diodorus of Tarsus wrote: \"For the wicked there are punishments, not perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a disadvantage, but they are to be purified for a brief period according to\n\nQuestion: what do christians believe about heaven hell and purgatory?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ludwig (1749–1784), a physician/scientist known for his translation of Joseph Priestley's scientific experiments. From 1728 he studied medicine and botany at the University of Leipzig, but due to lack of funds was forced to discontinue his studies, therefore taking a job as a botanist on an African expedition under the leadership of Johann Ernst Hebenstreit (1703–1757). Ludwig is remembered for his correspondence with Carl Linnaeus, in particular, discussions involving the latter's classification system. It was Linnaeus who named the plant genus Ludwigia in honor of Ludwig. Carl Ulisses von Salis-Marschlins or Karl or Charles (28 September 1762 in Marschlins &ndash; 16 January 1818) was a Swiss naturalist interested in botany, entomology, and conchology. Aside from Natural Sciences von Salis was also interested in agriculture, history and education and maintained contacts with researchers from abroad. Charles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Linnaeus had originally invented this system for botanical names in his 1753 work Species Plantarum, and presented it again in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae for more than 4,000 animal species. The 12th edition of Systema Naturae was the last edition of Systema Naturae to be overseen by its author, Carl Linnaeus. It was published by Laurentius Salvius in Holmiæ (Stockholm) in three volumes, with parts appearing from 1766 to 1768.\n\nQuestion: who was carolus linnaeus?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Among \n\n The politics of Hesse takes place within a framework of a federal parliamentary representative democratic republic, where the Federal Government of Germany exercises sovereign rights with certain powers reserved to the states of Germany including Hesse. The state has a multi-party system where, as in most other states of former Western Germany and the federal level, the two main parties are the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). They have no influence on federal legislation, but participate in the election of the President of Germany by electing state electors to the Federal Convention. This begins with the electoral system: Similar to federal elections, many states use a mixed-member proportional representation system in which each voter casts one vote for a constituency candidate and a second vote determines the proportional share \n\n The Bundestag, Germany's parliament, is elected according to the principle of proportional representation. In thirteen of the sixteen German states, the state parliament is known as the Landtag (an old German term that roughly means state parliament). In the states Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the state parliament is called Bürgerschaft (Citizenry), in Berlin it is called Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives).\n\nQuestion: what type of government does germany have now?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Run-up to Libya’s upcoming December elections are expected to be supervised by the transitional government which will be created, the UN added. Unrest driven by armed militias, ethnic minority and radical groups undermined the process and the government for the years following the overthrowing of Muammar Gaddafi. In December 2011, a group of armed men dragged Libya's attorney general Abdul-Aziz al-Hassady from his car in broad daylight \n\n In one interpretation of the 2011 Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration, the mandate of the General National Congress (GNC) was to expire on 7 February 2014. Public protests erupted as the GNC failed to stand down on 7 February 2014. In response, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said: \"The GNC is doing its work and so is the government. The army is in its headquarters, and Khalifa Haftar has no authority.\" On 16 May 2014, Haftar's militia launched a campaign it dubbed \"Operation Dignity\", in an offensive against Benghazi bases of Ansar al-Sharia. Elections were held in July 2012 to a General National Congress (GNC), which took power a month later, charged with organising a constituent assembly for authoring Libya's new constitution. In March 2014, Zeidan was ousted by the GNC, amid escalating conflict in the country. On 4 August 2014, the GNC was replaced by a newly elected House of Representatives (CoD), but on 25 August 2014, some members of the former GNC reconvened unilaterally and said they had elected Omar al-Hasi as Prime Minister, effectively leaving the country with two rival governments: the one proclaimed by the CoD in Tobruk and the one proclaimed by the claimant GNC in Tripoli.\n\nQuestion: what kind of government does libya have today?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She denied, for example, that her sister died while on a spy mission, as some theorists have past suggested.

Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \"standing buffalo\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The Bills, San Diego Chargers and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season. However; due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. They have not done this since moving into State Farm Stadium, however.

The canyon was named after William Grandstaff, a mixed-race cowboy, who prospected and ran cattle in the desert canyon in the late 1870s with a Canadian trapper named Frenchie. Until the 1960s, the canyon was named Nigger Bill Canyon. Located 800 meters above the canyon floor, upon first glance, it appears suspended in the air, giving it its name.

Grand Canyon Depot, also known as Grand Canyon Railroad Station, was constructed in 1909–10 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, in what is now Grand Canyon National Park. The station is within 100 m of the rim of the canyon, opposite the El Tovar Hotel, also built by the railroad. Towering 1500 ft above are granite cliffs and pinnacles.

The killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite Priests, but female Priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office. Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangites, though belief in their correctness is still required. In Judaism, Jews are forbidden from consuming (among other things) pork, any carnivore animals, any herbivores that are not ruminants, any ruminants that do not have split hooves, shellfish (including shrimps, lobsters and so on), fish species that don't have scales, blood of any kind, food offered to idols, or the meat of living animals or strangled animals. The Seven Laws of Noah, which Jews believe gentiles must follow, also forbid consuming the meat of living animals. The Council of Jerusalem instructed gentile Christians not to consume blood, food offered to idols, or the meat of strangled animals, since \"the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\" This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a \"payment for sin,\" but \n\n Animal sacrifice is the ritual killing of an animal as practiced by many religions as a means of appeasing a god or spiritual being, changing the course of nature or divining the future.

The region is bounded by the Turkish Straits to the northwest, the Black Sea to the north, the Armenian Highlands to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Southeast Europe. By this definition Anatolia comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey. Today, Anatolia is sometimes considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, thereby including the western part of the Armenian Highlands and northern Mesopotamia; its eastern and southern borders are coterminous with Turkey's borders.

The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line.

It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna \n\n Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages.

Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300BC. Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.

The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk.

Kennedy and that they smoked marijuana in a White House bedroom. According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a Secret Service agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom. Kennedy was accompanied by Philip de Zulueta, a fellow Roman Catholic and private secretary to MacMillan. On his way to and from the church Kennedy's sole topic of conversation was sexual gossip connected to the Profumo affair, much to Zulueta's astonishment; MacMillan was shocked by reports of Kennedy's conversations. Kennedy's appointments secretary Kenneth O'Donnell also denied Truitt's allegations of a love affair, stating that Meyer \"knew Jackie as well as she knew Jack.\" When the Associated Press asked Tony Bradlee about the affair, she responded: \"I knew nothing about it when Mary was alive. In 1957 Kennedy married science fiction author Charles Dye (author), who was previously married to fellow science fiction author Katherine MacLean. Kennedy never remarried or had children. In 1986 on her 70th birthday, Kennedy had a birthday gala at the New York City Playboy Club, sponsored by Christie Hefner—daughter of Hugh Hefner and former CEO of Playboy Enterprises.

Johnson's reasoning for missing practices was to help take care of his mother in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but because telephone lines were down across the area, there wasn't much of a way for Johnson to communicate to his head coach Claude Gilbert. Nevertheless, his dismissal from the Spartans football program dropped Johnson's draft stock all the way to the 169th pick in the 1990 NFL Draft by the Phoenix Cardinals. Johnson was selected by the Detroit Pistons with the 56th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft.

An otherwise \"obscure tax official\", Morelly wrote two books on education and a critique of Montesquieu. Prominent themes in French culture in these following years were “the search for both stability and legitimacy through adopting the rule of law and the centrality of exceptional measures that violated the rule of law in order to defend and impose the republic” (Brown 11). Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose ideas \n\n influenced the French Revolution, stated that “everything depended fundamentally on politics,” seeming to claim that “politics, rather than custom, morals, or religion, was the root of social life” (Hunt 1). They would no longer stand for what sociologist Max Weber would call Traditional Authority, in which they accepted orders from a king who claimed power from God and the oppressions of a class structure they could never escape simply because that was how it had always been done (Edles and Appelrouth). He had a major impact on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and George Eliot. His concept of Sociologie and social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer, evolving into modern academic sociology presented by Émile Durkheim as practical and objective social research. Comte's social theories culminated in his \"Religion of Humanity\", which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organisations in the 19th century. Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The Americans heavily relied on Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the \"balanced\" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions.\n\nQuestion: what did baron de montesquie influence?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid, although descriptions vary depending on location. One of the most famous accounts of Bigfoot is the Patterson-Gimlin film where a supposedly female Bigfoot marches across the screen with giant strides, turns to face the camera, then marches off up a steep hill and into the forest. The association was made at least as early as 1845, with colonists writing that Aboriginal people identified Diprotodon bones as belonging to bunyips, and Thomas Worsnop concluding that the fear of bunyip attacks at watering holes remembered a time when Diprotodon lived in marshes. The skunk ape, also known as the swamp ape and Florida Bigfoot, is a purported ape-like creature that is said to inhabit the forests and swamps of some southeastern United States, most notably in Florida. Like Bigfoot, a prominent subject within American folklore, supposed evidence of the existence of the skunk ape is based on a number of anecdotal sightings as well as disputed photographs, audio and video recordings, and footprints.\n\nQuestion: what do australians call bigfoot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg. One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg. It was used for Nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film Triumph of the Will. Speer modified Werner March's design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, 46 ft high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures proposed as part of Welthauptstadt Germania, Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. During the war, the Speer-designed Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse.\n\nQuestion: what did albert speer design?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the proposed new government. The new administration under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. James Madison spearheaded Congressional amendments to the Constitution as assurances to those cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution. In the United States, each state and territory has constitutional officers who lead the state governments of the United States. As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act, civil asset forfeiture laws, mass surveillance, police checkpoints and militarization of police, while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,  states' rights to determine drug and restroom laws, and federal management of public lands. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us constitution set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. According to 2006 census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 310,089 people claimed Dutch ancestry, full or partial, and 78,927 people declared they were born in the Netherlands. The level of immigration from the Netherlands has dropped significantly since the 1980s. Of Australian residents born in the Netherlands, 59,502 (75%) were Australian citizens. The history and presence of the Walloon people, i.e. francophone Belgians, in the Netherlands goes back to the foundation process of the Dutch state. Folklore of the Low Countries, often just referred to as Dutch folklore, includes the epics, legends, fairy tales and oral traditions of the people of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli.

His involvement with the Armory Show and prolonged exposure to European Modernism, however, changed his outlook utterly. As art historian Sam Hunter wrote, \"[One] could scarcely have guessed that the bold colors of Matisse and the radical simplifications of the Cubists would engage Davies' sympathies,\" but so they did. From 1952 to 1965, his landscapes were very constructed, the objects defined by black contours with some flat tints in the knife. During this period, he initially painted close to his home in Paris and Saint-Mandé and also the Cap Gris Nez sober and dark paintings of storms, of boats on the beach, ruins of the war. He also painted characters: clowns, poultry stockbreeders, sailors. Essentially, he was self-taught and is considered to be a naïve or primitive painter. As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. Now 84, Matisse died on 3 November 1954. The day before, when she came to his sickbed, Matisse made a last drawing – it was of her, using a ball-point pen.\n\nQuestion: what type of artist is henri matisse?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As a result of Hogarth's death, Charles Dickens missed the publication dates for The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. It was the only time in his life that Dickens missed publication dates.

Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875.

In 2010, Bradley (along with co-editor, Andrew DuBois) published The Anthology of Rap, which was described as \"an English major's hip-hop bible\". At 900 pages, the Anthology collects and organizes nearly three hundred lyrics from across hip hop's history. In 2011, Bradley collaborated with the rapper and actor Common on Common's memoir, One Day It'll All Make Sense. The book follows Common's life from his childhood on the South Side of Chicago to his multidimensional entertainment career today. The late author Maya Angelou called it a \"magnificent memoir.\" The journalist and author Touré \n\n The song was written by 2Pac for fellow Death Row rapper M.C. According to the Family Affair album insert, \"Unconditional Love\" lyrics were written and arranged by 2Pac and the songs producer, Johnny \"J\". Hammer wrote this about the song: \"This song was given to me as a gift from the late Tupac Shakur. Thank you Tupac for this beautiful, spiritual song.\" Black Power: The Politics of Liberation is a 1967 book co-authored by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and political scientist Charles V. Hamilton. Published originally as Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America, the book has become a staple work produced during the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement. One of the main focuses of the book is describing the struggles that black communities faced in trying to get involved in politics.\n\nQuestion: what book did tupac write?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, because the graphemes in Chinese's logographic writing system are not directly linked to pronunciation (though there are quasi-phonetic hints), Cantonese speakers who do not speak Mandarin will read aloud the characters in Cantonese pronunciation only. Here is an example:  In the above example, note the switching of the direct and indirect objects and the use of different vocabulary for certain words in the standard Chinese and colloquial Cantonese renditions. Note: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. Unique among the other Chinese language varieties, Cantonese has its own written form, but it is largely used in informal contexts, such as \n\n Words of Chinese origin have entered the English language and many European languages. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication.\n\nQuestion: what language do chinese people write in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach.

As with much of Debussy's work, it is referred to as Impressionistic, meaning that it expresses emotions and senses by making use of non-functional harmony and ambiguous key signatures, its tonality being mainly non-diatonic and usually having a sense of modality. Levidis was more impressed by Debussy's harmonic brevity as shown in his last works. He was a notable experimenter with novel combinations and new instruments: His interest in new sounds led him to be among the first to write for the Ondes Martenot (his Poème symphonique, a modernistic Symphonic Poem for Electrical Instrument and Orchestra, (op.43-B) was given on the occasion of the first public appearance of the instrument, premiered on 20 April 1928, at the Paris Opéra) and conducted \n\n Reflets dans l'eau opens in a slow tempo (andantino molto) (which is repeated through much of the piece) while the right hand is playing a set of chords to accompany the melody. It shares the main characteristics of French music of this period, similar to works by Ravel such as Jeux d'eau. By writing \"images\", Debussy was intending to not create linear musical progression. It was Richard Wagner's music that inspired Dallapiccola to start composing in earnest, and Claude Debussy's that caused him to stop: hearing Der fliegende Holländer while exiled to Austria convinced the young man that composition was his calling, but after first hearing Debussy in 1921, at age 17, he stopped composing for three years in order to give this important influence time to sink in.\n\nQuestion: what type of music did claude debussy play?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Between 1952 and 1955, he wrote a series of six detailed articles in Urdu on Hammurabi, his laws, Babylonian civilisation, traditions, customs and language. The six articles were subsequently revised, expanded and published as a book and in 2000, a new edition was published in Lahore entitled \"Hammurabi aur Babli Tahzib va Tamaddum\". Malik Ram maintained that Hammurabi is one of the all-time great figures in world history, who should be given more attention, time and space in the modern world, in educational institutions and by the media. He was the great great grandson of Hammurabi and, although the Babylonian kingdom had shrunk considerably since its peak under this illustrious ancestor, it still extended north from Babylon and the Euphrates to Mari and Terqa. For the most part, he appears to have been non-belligerent and content to stay at home at the seat of his kingdom as none of his year names describe the waging of war or the building of monumental edifices. They are about pious gifts to the gods and the erection of statues dedicated to himself. Other parts of the Code of Hammurabi show both debt and slavery as being part of the criminal justice system of the time, such as, \"If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it; if then the dam break \n\n Shamhat plays the integral role in Tablet I, of taming the wild man Enkidu, who was created by the gods as the rival to the mighty Gilgamesh.

Constantine used Nicomedia as his interim capital city between 324 and 330, while rebuilding and expanding Byzantium as Nova Roma (which he soon renamed again as Constantinopolis). Eastern Mediterranean populations, which remained under Eastern Roman (or \"Byzantine\") control after the 5th century, retained \"Roman\" as their predominant identity;' the majority of the population saw themselves as being Roman beyond any doubt and their emperor as ruling from the cultural and religious center of the Roman Empire: Constantinople, the New Rome.' Concurrently, the continuity of the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople meant that the turning-point for the Greek East came later, in the 7th century, as the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire centered around the Balkans, North Africa (Egypt and Carthage), and Asia Minor.

It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. The previous day, Maj. Gen. George Meade had decisively defeated Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. From this point onward, Lee attempted no more strategic offensives. Although two more years of fighting and a new, more aggressive general-in-chief (Grant) were required to fully subdue the rebellion, the eventual end at Appomattox Court House in 1865 seems inevitable in hindsight. While Gettysburg was seen by military and civilian observers at the time as a great battle, those in the North had little idea that two more bloody years would be required to finish the war. Gettysburg was the first major defeat suffered by Lee. In fact, the National Park Service marks the point at which Pickett's Charge collapsed, a copse of trees on Cemetery Ridge, \n\n at Marye's Heights in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, and then moved to the west.

Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war displaced over 800,000 refugees and killed over 100,000 people. The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic \"cleanse\" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. The war ended with NATO involvement and the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Political disputes and minor incidents in central and northern Bosnia and in northern and central Herzegovina led to Croat-Bosniak War in November 1992. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas around those towns \n\n In Serb-controlled areas, Serbs performed mass murders, ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs, primarily Bosniaks and Croats, established concentration camps and destroyed Bosniak and Croat cultural inheritance.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas. English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first immigration of non-English speakers from Western Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century. Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, primarily European languages. The English language was introduced to the Americas by British colonisation, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Over the past 400 years, the forms of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United \n\n American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century. The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the easternmost of the three pyramids of the queens. The American archaeologist George Andrew Reisner was \"confident\" that the structure housed Khamerernebty II, but this is far from certain. The fact that the structure once contained a pink granite sarcophagus, however, has led scholars to speculate that it may have been reused as a queen's burial tomb, or that it served as a chapel where the body of Menkaure was mummified.

Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n Australian English arose from a dialectal 'melting pot' created by the intermingling of early settlers who were from a variety of dialectal regions of Great Britain and Ireland. Australian English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. The earliest Australian English was spoken by the first generation of native-born colonists in the Colony of New South Wales from the end of the 18th century. Peter Miller Cunningham's 1827 book Two Years in New South Wales described the distinctive accent and vocabulary that had developed among the native-born colonists. century, had become largely extinct by the onset of the 21st century. Australian Aboriginal English is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. Samoan English is also influencing Australian English. In addition, some Australians speak creole languages derived from Australian English, such as Australian Kriol, Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk.\n\nQuestion: what language does australians speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The city of Lloydminster, which is bisected by the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary, and its immediate surrounding region, observe Mountain Time year-round, with officially sanctioned daylight saving time (which in the summer puts it in synchronization with the rest of Saskatchewan). Along the Manitoba border, the small, remote Saskatchewan towns of Denare Beach and Creighton unofficially observe Central Daylight Time during the summer, thereby keeping the same time as larger neighbouring Manitoba communities. Lloydminster's distinctive situation is reflected in other legal matters, including its time zone. Most of Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time, instead staying on Central Standard Time year-round. This has the effect of placing Lloydminster and the surrounding area in the Mountain Time Zone along with Alberta. South Australia time becomes UTC+10:30, called Central Daylight Time (CDT), possibly with \"Australia\" prefixed (ACDT). Most of Saskatchewan, despite geographically being in the Mountain Time Zone, observes year-round Central Standard Time (CST). In 2020, the Yukon Territory abandoned seasonal time change to permanently observe year-round Mountain Standard Time (MST). Part of the Peace River Regional District (including the communities of Chetwynd, Dawson Creek, Hudson's Hope, Fort St. John, Taylor and Tumbler Ridge) is on Mountain Time and does not observe DST. In 2014, the residents of Fort Nelson voted to stay on MST year-round also, which the community has observed since 2015. ; The East Kootenay region in southeastern British Columbia (including the communities of Cranbrook, Fernie, Sparwood, Golden and Invermere) is on Mountain Time and observes DST.

In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career. During his youth and musical training in Bonn, Beethoven had extensive, intimate exposure to Mozart's music. Written documentation of Beethoven's initial visit to Vienna is sparse; the two composers could conceivably have met. A contemporary of Beethoven's, Ignaz von Seyfried, describes his encounter with Mozart as follows (although Seyfried places the visit in 1790): \"Beethoven made a short stay at \n\n and through the appearance of life and nature, and makes one understandable and clear by means of the other....\" In 1821 he graduated at Giessen with a dissertation \"On the beautiful in music\". His lectures covered the history, theory, aesthetics and psychology of music. He was active, as organizer and conductor, in the musical life of Bonn, founding an orchestra and choral society. The Beethoven Monument in Bonn, unveiled in 1845, was his suggestion. Ludwig van Beethoven, a German composer, died in his apartment in the Schwarzspanierhaus, Vienna, on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56, following a prolonged illness. Beethoven's funeral was held three days later, and the procession was witnessed by a large crowd. Beethoven eventually returned to Vienna permanently in 1792, the year after Mozart's death. In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky.\n\nQuestion: what music period did beethoven live in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He rejected \n\n Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the election of 1976, but his foreign-policy became mired in endless difficulties, including a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and a confrontation with the new anti-American regime in Iran. Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball as Secretary of State, but he was vetoed by Brzezinski as too dovish. It was an embarrassment for Carter's administration, particularly as it took place soon after President Nixon's Watergate scandal and President Ford's pardon of Nixon just before he could be tried for any crimes. To ensure there was no hint of similar impropriety in the Carter administration, Lance resigned his position. During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C.

The \n\nState Special Enterprise Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was created on July 11, 2001 on base of the former Energoatom's company of the same name. The company was basically recommissioned under a special jurisdiction for the further decommissioning of its nuclear power station. Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl Reactor's proximity to floodplains. A study conducted in 1996 was conducted to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes traced from the disaster area. A cover was constructed around the damage reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Partially due to the already abandoned urban areas, as well as international relations currently affecting the country, remediation efforts have minimized compared to the initial clean up actions and more recent accidents such as the Fukushima incident. The worst nuclear accident to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

In the United States, the President requests funding for the UN in his annual budget proposal, and Congress refines his request and allocates funds in an annual appropriations bill under the oversight of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees and the State, Foreign Operations and Appropriations subcommittees. The U.S. maintains significant financial contributions to the UN because leaders see significant return on the investment as the UN supports and advances many U.S. national interests. The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The United Nations maintains and supports a number of specialized organizations and agencies. Sometimes they do not report to the General Assembly or Security Council but only to their own member states. The organisations themselves generally report to the member states of the treaty rather than to the General Assembly. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development.

Adams damaged his standing in his first annual message to Congress, when he argued that Congress must not give the world the impression \"that we are palsied by the will of our constituents.\" It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, \n\n In 1720, Adams purchased a farm in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then called the \"north precinct\" of Braintree, Massachusetts). No presidential candidate received a majority in the Electoral College, and the election was ultimately resolved by the House of Representatives, where Adams was declared the winner over Crawford and Jackson, who in the election had led Adams in both popular vote and electoral vote. After Clay, the Speaker of the House, was appointed Secretary of State by Adams, Jackson's supporters denounced what they considered a \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Clay to give Adams the presidency in exchange for Clay receiving the office of Secretary of State, the holder of which had traditionally become the next president. Calhoun \n\n expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams. In 1827, the Massachusetts legislature elected him to the United States Senate. Prior to the 1828 presidential election, he worked with Clay to build the National Republican Party across the country. While Clay rallied support for the party in the West, he emerged as a leading National Republican in the Northeastern states.

For the marriage to be legal the license must be notarized and filed with the local county probate office within 30 days of the notarization. This change was due to controversy of same sex marriages becoming legal nationwide and probate judges protesting the legality of the state issuing certificates to same sex partners. In many states, it is illegal to cross state lines to obtain a marriage that would be illegal in the home state. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple.

Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love,\" derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός adelphós (brother, brotherly). It is named for Penn Township in Berks County, which in turn is named for William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania.

Banks would accept the exchange of legacy currencies, begin to dispense euros from ATMs, and only euros would be available as withdrawals were made, beginning on 1 January.

The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. James then embarked on further experiments. He suggested using sodium nitrate instead of air in the Bessemer process for manufacturing steel but this proved to be too expensive. He developed a process for recovering phosphates from blast furnace slag. In association with Thomas Robinson, he invented a process for producing saltcake (sodium sulfate) from salt without the use of sulfuric acid.

He played for the Fighting Irish from 1922 until 1924 and was a member of the \"Seven Mules\" line that blocked for the famed Four Horsemen. During the mid-1930s Hunsinger was an ends coach at Fordham University, where he moved Vince Lombardi from end to guard. The College All-Americans played the NFL champion Chicago Bears to a scoreless tie, and the Associated Press cited Everhardus as one of three college stars who \"stood out on the floodlighted field.\" In addition to his performance in the backfield, Everhardus gained attention for a 60-yard kick that pinned the Bears deep in their own territory late in the game. After graduating from Michigan, Everhardus signed a contract to play professional football for the Detroit Lions, but obtained a release from the contract so that he could accept a position as an assistant football coach at Penn State. Vince Evans played high school football for Ben L. Smith High in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is one of six players from that program that went on to play pro football.

The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government. The American Revolution established the United States with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments. The United States has the world's oldest written constitution, and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the US Constitution, often word-for-word in places. It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era. Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war. While many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some, yet denying it to others, the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition \n\n The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives.\n\nQuestion: what kind of government did the united states have after the revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena. According to the legend, Lucy was a 75-year-old widow and Geminian a young catechist. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. The most common interpretation of her life is that Saint Avoye was born in Sicily, to her father, Quintien, who was a Sicilian pagan, and to her mother, Gérasine, a Christian, who was originally from the province of Brittany. During the year of her death, Avoye went to Cornwall to assist her aunt Saint Ursula at her wedding. According to Loyola Press, she was a saint because of her charitable works, not her trances, demonstrated by her forgiveness towards a group of people who abused her during a trance, despite the excruciating pain they caused her. She ministered to the sick and the poor, moving into the hospital in Siena towards the end of her life, \"subjecting herself to great mortifications\". Her feast day is April 26. She was born in 1835, in Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nQuestion: where was st. lucy born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Instead, each territory is governed under a Commonwealth statute —for the ACT, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. The executive of the Australian Capital Territory, also known as the ACT Government, consists of the \n\n In December 1988, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament, a step proposed as early as 1965. The Australian Labor Party formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia's first female head of government. There is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a city council for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory. However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government. The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or \n\n Australia remains a constitutional monarchy under the Australian Constitution adopted in 1901, with the duties of the head of state performed by a Governor-General selected by the Australian Prime Minister. Australian republicanism has persisted since colonial times, though for much of the 20th century, the monarchy remained popular. In the early 1990s, republicanism became a significant political issue. Australian Labor Party Prime Minister Paul Keating indicated a desire to instigate a republic in time for the Centenary of the Federation of Australia in 2001. Under John Howard, the Coalition won the 1996 Federal Election and set the Convention date for February 1998.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does australia have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name \"microscope\" was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625.\n\n publica, which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse c. 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. With a Fontana's telescope, the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupi observed for the first time in 1630 the horizontal bands on the atmosphere of Jupiter and in 1639 the phases of Mercury, an evidence, together with the phases of Venus observed by Galileo in 1610, that the Copernicus's heliocentric theory was correct. In 1645, he claimed to have observed a satellite of Venus (Paul Stroobant demonstrated in 1887 that all similar observations were not related to a putative satellite of Venus).\n\nQuestion: what objects did galileo see with his telescope?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family's property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea \n\n During the 1940s and 1950s Dalí's interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with nuclear science, feeling that \"thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought\". The Colossus of Rhodes came from Dalí's longstanding fascination with Hollywood. For the 1956 Cinerama film Seven Wonders of the World, a travelogue featuring Lowell Thomas, Dalí was commissioned to create seven paintings of the wonders. Dalí's most recognised works date from before 1940, when he was preoccupied with the subconscious and the nature of perception. At the end of World War II, a focus on the historical, scientific, and religious was introduced into Dalí's work. But Dalí became an early supporter of Antonio Pitxot's work, and eventually asked him to co-design the Dalí Theatre and Museum (Teatre-Museu Dalí) in Figueres, Spain. Pitxot and Dalí were nearly inseparable in the last years of Dalí's life: designing Dalí's museum, teaching art and exchanging ideas about their work. Pitxot was a protector of Dalí's legacy after his death: He was a member of the board of the Gala Salvador Dalí Foundation, and he has led, and sat on the board, of several other Dalí foundations.
