Cilician Armenia, weakened by wars and in need of strong ally, found a temporary solution in a tie with the Principality of Antioch: the regent suggested that Prince Bohemond IV should send his fourth son, Philip, to marry Isabella, insisting only that the bridegroom should join the separated Armenian Church. Philip agreed to adopt the Armenian faith, communion and customs and to respect the privileges of all nations in Cilician Armenia. Philip married Isabella at Sis in June 1222 and was accepted as king. The joint rule of Isabella and Philip was brief; Philip’s disdain for the Armenian ritual, which he had promised \n\n respect, and his marked favoritism to the Latin barons angered the Armenian nobility. When it was rumored that Philip wanted to give the crown and throne to Antioch, Constantine of Barbaron led a revolt at the end of 1224. Philip and Isabella were seized at Tall Hamdun (today Toprakkale in Turkey) on their way to Antioch and taken back to Sis, where Philip was imprisoned and probably poisoned at the beginning of 1225. She sought refuge \n\n Philip I, also known as Philip of Saint Pol (25 July 1404 &ndash; Leuven, 4 August 1430), was the younger son of Antoine, Duke of Brabant and Jeanne of Saint-Pol. The citizens were pacified by John's \n\n 13th-century Philip of Novara and John of Ibelin) held, the King of Jerusalem, Amalric, ransomed him personally.\n\n"

In 1890, Isaac Crossman deeded approximately 60 acres of land to his son George, who began building Crossman House in anticipation of his upcoming engagement to Nellie Dodge in March 1892. George Crossman was described in the local newspaper as a \"popular ladies' man,\" while Nellie was \"one of Lewinsville's fair daughters.\" George and Nellie had six children, four of whom survived infancy: William Clark (1894), Florence Celeste (1897), George Isaac (1900) and Mary Louise (1903). On September 16, 1899 the family made local news when four-year-old William Clark Crossman was gored in the arm by a cow's horn, which cut open six inches of the child's arm, \"nearly severing an artery.\" He was born in London, the son of Thomas Denman and the former Theodosia Anne Vevers. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George Fortescue Wilbraham. Following his father's death, his mother wed Thomas Collicott in 1809. Collicott was convicted of fraud over revenue stamps and was transported to New South Wales on the Earl Spencer in October 1813. Mary applied for assistance to join her husband and arrived in Sydney with five children, including George, on the Mary Ann in January 1816. George Crossman (1863-1942) was the son of Isaac Crossman (1824-1900) (also spelled Crossmun) who played an important role in the development of the city of Falls Church.

Just a month earlier, his wife Mary Ann Mutersbaugh had died from complications following childbirth, leaving Isaac a widower with six young children. In 1866, Isaac married Elizabeth Peffer. Isaac Crossman was a business and civic leader, serving as Alderman on the first Falls Church Council when the city was incorporated in 1875 and becoming a director of the Fairfax and Georgetown Turnpike Company.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of George Thomas Orlando Bridgeman's father?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1890, Isaac Crossman deeded approximately 60 acres of land to his son George, who began building Crossman House in anticipation of his upcoming engagement to Nellie Dodge in March 1892. George Crossman was described in the local newspaper as a \"popular ladies' man,\" while Nellie was \"one of Lewinsville's fair daughters.\" George and Nellie had six children, four of whom survived infancy: William Clark (1894), Florence Celeste (1897), George Isaac (1900) and Mary Louise (1903). On September 16, 1899 the family made local news when four-year-old William Clark Crossman was gored in the arm by a cow's horn, which cut open six inches of the child's arm, \"nearly severing an artery.\" He was born in London, the son of Thomas Denman and the former Theodosia Anne Vevers. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George Fortescue Wilbraham. Following his father's death, his mother wed Thomas Collicott in 1809. Collicott was convicted of fraud over revenue stamps and was transported to New South Wales on the Earl Spencer in October 1813. Mary applied for assistance to join her husband and arrived in Sydney with five children, including George, on the Mary Ann in January 1816. George Crossman (1863-1942) was the son of Isaac Crossman (1824-1900) (also spelled Crossmun) who played an important role in the development of the city of Falls Church. In 1864, Isaac Crossman came from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to Northern Virginia, where he purchased the 126-acre Osborn-Hunter farm from Cyrus, Seth and Mary Osborn located in the areas now known as Falls Church and East Falls Church. Just a month earlier, his wife Mary Ann Mutersbaugh had died from complications following childbirth, leaving Isaac a widower with six young children. In 1866, Isaac married Elizabeth Peffer. Isaac Crossman was a business and civic leader, serving as Alderman on the first Falls Church Council when the city was incorporated in 1875 and becoming a director of the Fairfax and Georgetown Turnpike Company.\n\n"
