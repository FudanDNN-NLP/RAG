The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. Every chemical element has absorption lines at particular wavelengths, which correspond to the differences between the energy levels of its atomic orbitals. When light passes through a gas or liquid containing these elements, certain wavelengths are absorbed, resulting in dark lines or bands in the spectrum. 1) A solid, liquid, or dense gas excited to emit light will radiate at all wavelengths and thus produce a continuous spectrum. ; 2) A low-density gas excited to emit light will do so at specific wavelengths and this produces an emission spectrum. ; 3) If light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, the result will be an absorption spectrum.

Larger pumice blocks rise for a more extended period of time (minutes to hours) in comparison to smaller pumice fragments because of gases trapped within vesicles and the very fine ash fragments may become entrained into the rising plume of gas and heated water because of the low density and weight. Therefore, subaqueous silicic pyroclastic eruptions may be diminished in the course size fraction as well as the very fine \n\n The density of individual particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200 kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450 kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300 kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200 kg/m3 for lithic particles. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) together with a high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive. There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish plutonic from volcanic rock. For example, the alkali feldspar in plutonic rocks is typically orthoclase, while the higher-temperature polymorph, sanidine, is more common in volcanic rock. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition. Pyroclastic density currents can also produce ash particles. Within pyroclastic density currents particle abrasion occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within \n\n Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions, and may also be formed during transport in pyroclastic density currents.\n\n"
