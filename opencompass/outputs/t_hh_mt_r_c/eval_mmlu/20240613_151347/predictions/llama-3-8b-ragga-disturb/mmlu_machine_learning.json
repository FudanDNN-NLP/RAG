CNNs excel in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data. Additionally, CNNs have fewer parameters compared to fully connected neural networks, making them computationally efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting. This distinct architecture and feature extraction capability contribute to their superior performance in image and video processing tasks. fed into analytics engines for interpretation of images, audio, or video to implement usages such as web visual search, autonomous transportation, surveillance, smart cities, and robotics. Visual computing technologies in the media analytics segment include three subdomains: Media analytics often makes use of “deep learning” frameworks, which involve training an algorithm using large amounts of source data. The resulting trained algorithm can then make rapid or instantaneous interpretations of new input data based on rules developed during the training stage. This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons, and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex. In a recurrent neural network the signal will propagate through a layer more than once; thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning. RNNs can be trained by gradient descent, however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can \"vanish\" (that is, they can tend to zero) or \"explode\" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces. Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others. Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers. We propose a deep learning architecture, based on VGG-16 network for learning high-level image representation to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image binary classification tasks by dividing whole-slide images on 50x50 pixel histology image patches. We aim to learn discriminant compact features at beginning of our deep convolutional neural network. Key words: breast cancer, biopsy, deep learning, machine learning, VGG16, convolutional neural network. This success has prompted a surge of interest in applying deep convolutional networks (DCN) to medical imaging. Many recent studies have shown the potential of applying such networks to medical imaging, including breast screening mammography; however, without investigating the fundamental differences between medical and natural images and their impact on the design choices and performance of proposed models. For instance, many recent works have either significantly downscaled a whole image or focused on classifying a small region of interest. Furthermore, the potential of DCNs has only been assessed in limited settings of small data sets often consisting of less than 1000 images, while the success of such networks in natural object recognition is largely attributed to the availability of more than 1M annotated images. A deep convolutional neural network [10, pp. 2278–2324] is a classifier that takes an image x as input, often with multiple channels corresponding to different colors (e.g., RGB), and outputs the conditional probability distribution over the categories. This is done by a series of nonlinear functions that gradually transform the input pixel-level image. A major property of the deep convolutional network, which distinguishes it from a multi-layer perceptron, is that it heavily relies on convolutional and pooling layers, which make the network invariant to local translation of visual features in the input.

We chose a VGG-16 network to classify the 50×50 histology image patches in order to explore the scale and organization features of nuclei and the scale features of the overall structure. Because they do not have complicated high-level semantic information, a 16-layer structure suffices. To leverage contextual information from the cropped images, we added global context to the last convolutional layer of the VGG networks. The input images are passed to two independent branches, our VGG network and a global average pooling layer. The transformed output of the global pooling layer is unpooled to the same shape as that of the feature maps after the last convolutional layer of the VGG network and is then concatenated with the feature maps. These two feature maps are then fused by another 1×1 convolutional layer and then passed through three fully-connected (FC) layers for classification.
