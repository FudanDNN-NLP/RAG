The Company is the Lipid Management Company, a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing complementary, convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company intends to use positive results from the Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 which includes provisions to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. The secured promissory notes issued under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of 6.40% and are due on July 1, 2018. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for 277,690 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $6.99 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the remaining 177,123 warrants were net exercised for 159,944 shares of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 71,237 warrants were net exercised for 62,525 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 8,230 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.19 per share. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company, Tim Mayleben, and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that the Company, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that the Company announced on May 2, 2018. The term of the lease commences with respect to all of the space in the leased premises on the later to occur of (i) the date upon which landlord delivers the premises to the Company under the terms of the lease with the delivery conditions set forth in the lease satisfied and (ii) November 1, 2018 (the Lease Commencement Date). The term of the lease shall end 60 months after the Lease Commencement Date. Under the terms of the lease, following the first month (during which the base rent is $0) and the second month (during which the base rent is $15,990), the base rent, subject to certain adjustments, for the leased premises will start at approximately $19,412 per month, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and shall increase on an annual basis and/or as otherwise provided in the lease agreement. At June 30, 2018, remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as current on the balance sheets were less than 12 months and remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as long-term were less than two years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on investments of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, and income for the accretion of premiums and discounts on investments of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on available-for-sale investments of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, and expense for the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and require the reporting entity to develop assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2017 Plan was set to 750,000, with any shares of common stock that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon the exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock, or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2017 Plan added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. and available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be cumulatively increased by 2.5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares of common stock determined by the compensation committee. The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs. As of June 30, 2018, there was $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, warrants for common stock, stock options and unvested RSUs are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans, or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those referred to or discussed in or incorporated by reference into the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and we expect to report top-line results in August 2018.\nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and 2) patients who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin, and can be considered statin intolerant. We expect to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. We are also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT,  known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expect the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intend to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy or continue operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred $61.0 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our 1002FDC-053 study, our open-label extension study, our 1002FDC-058 study and our Phase 2 (1002-39) clinical study of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, or PCSK9i, therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred $56.3 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and our Phase 2 (1002-038) clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination plus atorvastatin with bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 12-week, pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of four treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral, fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg alone and effects on other risk markers, including hsCRP, non-HDL-C, apoB and total cholesterol. Study 2 is a 52-week global pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD and/or HeFH, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 24-week LDL-C lowering efficacy, and 52-week safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo. Initiated in June 2018, the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of three treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo and versus ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Safety data will be obtained from an open-label extension study which completed enrollment of 1,462 of the 2,230 patients enrolled in Study 1 in March 2018. Initiated in February 2017, this open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and with ASCVD and/or HeFH whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety in patients treated with bempedoic acid for up to 1.5 years. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 52- and 78-week effects of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB and hsCRP. CLEAR Outcomes is an event driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of bempedoic acid in patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are at high risk for CVD, with hypercholesterolemia and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated CLEAR Outcomes in December 2016, and the study is intended to support our submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. If we fail to complete the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates and secure approval from regulatory authorities, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical studies and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical studies beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical studies, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, patent prosecution, protection and review, consulting and accounting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in connection with the continued research and development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, increases in our headcount, expansion of our information technology infrastructure, and increased expenses associated with being a public company and complying with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. Other income, net, primarily relates to interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and also includes interest expense associated with our credit facility and non-cash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related debt discount, deferred issuance costs and final payment fee. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by us without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were $39.5 million, compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to clinical development costs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was $0.8 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $1.5 million, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness. In June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the credit facility) with Oxford Finance LLC whereby we received net proceeds of $4.9 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under a term loan as part of the facility. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 465,000 additional shares of our common stock, which was exercised in full in September 2017. We invest our cash equivalents and investments in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and government securities to preserve principal. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $82.4 million and $60.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary use of our cash was to fund the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of $61.9 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturities of highly liquid, interest bearing investment-grade and government securities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, related primarily to proceeds from exercise of our common stock options. Net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, related primarily to payments on our credit facility. · the implementation of operational and financial information technology. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or royalty-based financing arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of approximately $24.4 million and $177.4 million at June 30, 2018, and $34.5 million and $239.2 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us, Tim Mayleben and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that we, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that we announced on May 2, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 2 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with those set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. The following risk factors represent new risk factors or those containing changes, including material changes, to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If any of the previously identified or following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years.

Within ten (10) days following the execution of this Amendment, to the extent not already selected, Tenant shall select the finish materials and color selections from Landlords Building standard list to be used in the performance of Landlords Work. Upon finalization of the Working Drawings, Landlords contractor shall diligently prosecute Landlords Work to completion without interruption or delay, subject to force majeure events and Tenant Delay (as defined below), in a first-class and good and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the Working Drawings, using new materials (unless otherwise noted in the Working Drawings), and in compliance with all applicable laws. If, as a result of such inspection, Tenant discovers deviations or deficiencies from the Working Drawings, then Tenant may deliver a preliminary punch list of such deviations or deficiencies (Punch List Items) to Landlord. The existence of a preliminary punch list shall not postpone the delivery of Expansion Premises as long as (i) the Punch List Items are customarily considered to be punch list items as the term is used in the construction industry, and (ii) neither the failure to complete nor the process of completing any such Punch List Items will delay or unreasonably interfere with Tenants Work or the operation of Tenants business in the Expansion Premises, and (iii) the Punch List Items will not delay Landlord obtaining Tenants certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy, as may be applicable. Subject to force majeure, Landlord shall correct or cure the Punch List Items within thirty (30) days following Landlords receipt of the preliminary punch list, or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary, provided Landlord is proceeding with due diligence to complete the Punch List Items. Landlord may enter the Expansion Premises at any reasonable time with prior notice to Tenant to correct or cure the Punch List Items, provided Landlord takes reasonable precautions to avoid interfering with Tenants Work or Tenants business at the Premises. As used herein, Substantial Completion shall mean the stage in the progress of Landlords Work when Landlords Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with the requirements of the Working Drawings, so that Tenant can (a) occupy or utilize the Expansion Premises for its intended use, or (b) complete any work which could not be completed by Tenant simultaneously with Landlords Work. As used herein, Tenant Delay shall mean any delay in the performance of Landlords Work that occurs as the result of (i) any request or change order by Tenant either that Landlord perform any work in addition to Landlords Work, or that delays, for any reason, Landlord commencing or completing Landlords Work to be performed prior to the delivery of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; (ii) any change by Tenant to the Working Drawings, other than a change required to cause the Working Drawings to conform to applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iii) any failure of Tenant to respond to any request for approval required hereunder within the period specified herein for such response; (iv) any delay in Landlords Work caused by the installation of Tenants fixtures in the Expansion Premises or the performance of any work or activities by Tenant prior to the delivery of possession of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; or (v) failure by Tenant to pay any excess Total Construction Costs over the Tenant Improvement Allowance as invoiced by Landlord. cost of construction, including: labor and materials, architectural, engineering, design, and construction management fees, fees for permits and inspection, tap fees, connection fees and all other hard costs directly related to completion of Landlords Work (Total Construction Costs). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Oxford Design Build, an affiliate of Landlord (the General Contractor), shall be the general contractor for all of Landlords Work, and their construction management fee shall be limited to nine (9%) of the hard costs of the Landlords Work (expressly excluding architectural, engineering, and design fees). In the event the Construction Costs Estimate exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay one-half of the difference to Landlord upon execution by Tenant of this Amendment (Construction Deposit). If the Total Construction Costs of Landlords Work is more than the Tenant Improvement Allowance but less than the sum of the Construction Deposit plus the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Landlord shall refund Tenant the amount by which the Construction Deposit plus Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeded the Total Construction Cost as a credit toward Base Rent. If the Total Construction Costs are less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Landlord shall refund the Construction Deposit received as a credit toward Base Rent, and the remaining difference shall be forfeited with no further obligation of Landlord therefore. Revenue earned under our U.S. Army funded research grant was $509,000 for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $78,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2011. Net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Reduced financial loss from operations to $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.1 million for same period last year. Engaged global contract research organization Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) to manage STOP-TBI Phase IIb trial for Oxycyte PFC Emulsion. Oxygen Biotherapeutics reported net revenue of $514,872 for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $95,159 for the comparable quarter in the previous fiscal year. Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the quarter, we recorded approximately $170,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year. General and administrative expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $369,550 compared to $1,526,775 for the same period in 2011. Research and development expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $604,574 compared to $488,577 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $874,435 compared to $875,695 for the same period in 2011. For the second quarter ended October 31, 2012, the Company reported a net loss of $1,557,278, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,929,923, or $0.12 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Total net revenue for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $786,968 compared to total revenue of $120,032 for the same period in fiscal year 2012. Total operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $3,145,252 compared to $4,602,337 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses. General and administrative expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,593,734 compared to $3,098,431for the same period in 2011. The reduction in general and administrative expense for the period was due primarily to decreases in compensation costs, legal and professional fees, facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, during the period, we reduced our estimate of potential costs associated with our contingent liability, related to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, by approximately $530,000. Research and development expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,241,846 compared to $1,140,538 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $2,785,535 compared to $1,316,687 for the same period in 2011. The increase in interest and other expenses for the period was due primarily to the non-cash interest charges for dividends and fair value adjustments on our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock that was not incurred in the prior year, partially offset by the non-cash interest charges for the accretion of the discount on our notes payable which were not incurred in the current period. The Company reported a net loss of $5,143,819, or $0.17 per share for the six month period ended October 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $5,798,992, or $0.25 per share for the same period in 2011. As of October 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,511,513, compared to $1,879,872 at April 30, 2012. Our company's focus is reflected in our financial results and we remain committed to investing a substantial amount of our resources on development of the programs that will lead us to success and build stockholder value.\" The company has developed a proprietary perfluorocarbon (PFC) therapeutic oxygen carrier called Oxycyte® that is currently in clinical and preclinical studies for intravenous delivery for indications such as traumatic brain injury, decompression sickness and stroke.

We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We are expensing costs associated with the manufacture of our lebrikizumab product candidate. We review all inventory balances on a quarterly basis for impairment and recognize any reduction in value as a current period expense with a reserve provision on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under certain collaborative arrangements, we have been reimbursed for a portion of our research and development (“R&D”) expenses, including costs of drug supplies. When these R&D services are performed under a reimbursement or cost sharing model with our collaboration partner, we record these reimbursements as a reduction of R&D expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for dilutive potential shares of common stock. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. We expect the implementation of Topic 842 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as we had aggregate future minimum lease payments of approximately $21.6 million as of June 30, 2018. We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. In connection with the acquisition of Valocor Therapeutics, Inc. (“Valocor”) in 2011, we acquired intangible assets that were associated with in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects relating to preclinical product candidates. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. Under Topic 606, we evaluated the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement and the transfer of intellectual property rights (the “license”) was identified as the only performance obligation as of the inception of the agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. Future potential milestone amounts would be recognized as revenue from collaboration arrangements, if unconstrained. Reimbursable program costs are recognized proportionately with the performance of the underlying services or delivery of drug substance and are accounted for as reductions to R&D expense and are excluded from the transaction price. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. The Transition Agreement, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors. In consideration for the repurchase of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, UCB paid us $11.0 million in November 2017 and an additional $39.0 million in June 2018 upon FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis. We are obligated to reimburse UCB for up to $10.0 million of development costs incurred by UCB in connection with the development of Cimzia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. If the aggregate development costs reimbursed by us to UCB during this six-month period are less than $10.0 million, we will pay UCB the difference between such aggregate costs and $10.0 million. These terms replace the provisions of the UCB Agreement pursuant to which we would have been eligible to recoup our external development costs incurred related to the Cimzia program, net of milestones received, through a royalty on future net sales of Cimzia. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $39.0 million milestone amount payable upon the approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in the United States was initially not included in the transaction price, as it was determined to be fully constrained. Upon UCB’s receipt of FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in June 2018, the $39.0 million milestone payment was included in the transaction price and fully recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as all performance obligations were satisfied. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement (“Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”), pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting interleukin 13, for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and a $25.0 million payment to Roche in July 2018 upon the achievement of 50% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab, which was achieved in June 2018, and will make an additional payment to Roche in 2018 for $30.0 million within thirty days after the earlier of December 15, 2018 or the achievement of 100% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for all indications. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement includes a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. As of June 30, 2018, we have paid or accrued license and other fees of $1.8 million to Rose U and are required to pay additional amounts totaling up to $3.1 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, commercialization and other milestones under these agreements to Rose U and Stiefel, including a $2.5 million payment due within thirty days after the first commercial sale of QBREXZA. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. We are entitled to credit the $2.5 million milestone payment against future royalty payments owed to Rose U and Stiefel in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. The interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and other disclosures (including the disclosures under “Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc.

Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Achieved 50% patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab in June 2018, triggering a $25.0 million milestone payment, which was paid in July 2018. The clinical study is a Phase 2b dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Received a payment of $39.0 million from UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”) in June 2018 in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in May 2018. The payment is pursuant to a transition agreement (“Transition Agreement”) that provided for an orderly transition of activities under the development and commercialisation agreement between us and UCB, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided for the development and commercialization of Cimzia, an injectable biologic tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $38.0 million to $39.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 25% to $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $37.2 million to $39.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 2% to $45.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. We expect to incur significant costs to continue to build out our infrastructure, prepare for the commercial launch of QBREXZA, recently approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older product, and continue to advance our lebrikizumab product candidate through clinical development. The timing and the amount of future funding we will require, and the success of our business, will be based in large part on the successful commercialization of QBREXZA. We currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration or license agreements.

The Company is the Lipid Management Company, a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing complementary, convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company intends to use positive results from the Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 which includes provisions to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. The secured promissory notes issued under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of 6.40% and are due on July 1, 2018. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for 277,690 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $6.99 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the remaining 177,123 warrants were net exercised for 159,944 shares of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 71,237 warrants were net exercised for 62,525 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 8,230 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.19 per share. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company, Tim Mayleben, and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that the Company, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that the Company announced on May 2, 2018. The term of the lease commences with respect to all of the space in the leased premises on the later to occur of (i) the date upon which landlord delivers the premises to the Company under the terms of the lease with the delivery conditions set forth in the lease satisfied and (ii) November 1, 2018 (the Lease Commencement Date). The term of the lease shall end 60 months after the Lease Commencement Date. Under the terms of the lease, following the first month (during which the base rent is $0) and the second month (during which the base rent is $15,990), the base rent, subject to certain adjustments, for the leased premises will start at approximately $19,412 per month, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and shall increase on an annual basis and/or as otherwise provided in the lease agreement. At June 30, 2018, remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as current on the balance sheets were less than 12 months and remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as long-term were less than two years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on investments of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, and income for the accretion of premiums and discounts on investments of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on available-for-sale investments of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, and expense for the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and require the reporting entity to develop assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2017 Plan was set to 750,000, with any shares of common stock that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon the exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock, or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2017 Plan added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. and available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be cumulatively increased by 2.5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares of common stock determined by the compensation committee. The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs. As of June 30, 2018, there was $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, warrants for common stock, stock options and unvested RSUs are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans, or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those referred to or discussed in or incorporated by reference into the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and we expect to report top-line results in August 2018.\nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and 2) patients who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin, and can be considered statin intolerant. We expect to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. We are also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT,  known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expect the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intend to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy or continue operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred $61.0 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our 1002FDC-053 study, our open-label extension study, our 1002FDC-058 study and our Phase 2 (1002-39) clinical study of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, or PCSK9i, therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred $56.3 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and our Phase 2 (1002-038) clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination plus atorvastatin with bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 12-week, pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of four treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral, fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg alone and effects on other risk markers, including hsCRP, non-HDL-C, apoB and total cholesterol. Study 2 is a 52-week global pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD and/or HeFH, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 24-week LDL-C lowering efficacy, and 52-week safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo. Initiated in June 2018, the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of three treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo and versus ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Safety data will be obtained from an open-label extension study which completed enrollment of 1,462 of the 2,230 patients enrolled in Study 1 in March 2018. Initiated in February 2017, this open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and with ASCVD and/or HeFH whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety in patients treated with bempedoic acid for up to 1.5 years. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 52- and 78-week effects of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB and hsCRP. CLEAR Outcomes is an event driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of bempedoic acid in patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are at high risk for CVD, with hypercholesterolemia and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated CLEAR Outcomes in December 2016, and the study is intended to support our submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. If we fail to complete the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates and secure approval from regulatory authorities, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical studies and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical studies beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical studies, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, patent prosecution, protection and review, consulting and accounting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in connection with the continued research and development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, increases in our headcount, expansion of our information technology infrastructure, and increased expenses associated with being a public company and complying with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. Other income, net, primarily relates to interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and also includes interest expense associated with our credit facility and non-cash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related debt discount, deferred issuance costs and final payment fee. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by us without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were $39.5 million, compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to clinical development costs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was $0.8 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $1.5 million, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness. In June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the credit facility) with Oxford Finance LLC whereby we received net proceeds of $4.9 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under a term loan as part of the facility. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 465,000 additional shares of our common stock, which was exercised in full in September 2017. We invest our cash equivalents and investments in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and government securities to preserve principal. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $82.4 million and $60.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary use of our cash was to fund the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of $61.9 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturities of highly liquid, interest bearing investment-grade and government securities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, related primarily to proceeds from exercise of our common stock options. Net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, related primarily to payments on our credit facility. · the implementation of operational and financial information technology. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or royalty-based financing arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of approximately $24.4 million and $177.4 million at June 30, 2018, and $34.5 million and $239.2 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us, Tim Mayleben and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that we, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that we announced on May 2, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 2 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with those set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. The following risk factors represent new risk factors or those containing changes, including material changes, to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If any of the previously identified or following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years.

If, as a result of such inspection, Tenant discovers deviations or deficiencies from the Working Drawings, then Tenant may deliver a preliminary punch list of such deviations or deficiencies (Punch List Items) to Landlord. The existence of a preliminary punch list shall not postpone the delivery of Expansion Premises as long as (i) the Punch List Items are customarily considered to be punch list items as the term is used in the construction industry, and (ii) neither the failure to complete nor the process of completing any such Punch List Items will delay or unreasonably interfere with Tenants Work or the operation of Tenants business in the Expansion Premises, and (iii) the Punch List Items will not delay Landlord obtaining Tenants certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy, as may be applicable. Subject to force majeure, Landlord shall correct or cure the Punch List Items within thirty (30) days following Landlords receipt of the preliminary punch list, or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary, provided Landlord is proceeding with due diligence to complete the Punch List Items. Landlord may enter the Expansion Premises at any reasonable time with prior notice to Tenant to correct or cure the Punch List Items, provided Landlord takes reasonable precautions to avoid interfering with Tenants Work or Tenants business at the Premises. As used herein, Substantial Completion shall mean the stage in the progress of Landlords Work when Landlords Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with the requirements of the Working Drawings, so that Tenant can (a) occupy or utilize the Expansion Premises for its intended use, or (b) complete any work which could not be completed by Tenant simultaneously with Landlords Work. As used herein, Tenant Delay shall mean any delay in the performance of Landlords Work that occurs as the result of (i) any request or change order by Tenant either that Landlord perform any work in addition to Landlords Work, or that delays, for any reason, Landlord commencing or completing Landlords Work to be performed prior to the delivery of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; (ii) any change by Tenant to the Working Drawings, other than a change required to cause the Working Drawings to conform to applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iii) any failure of Tenant to respond to any request for approval required hereunder within the period specified herein for such response; (iv) any delay in Landlords Work caused by the installation of Tenants fixtures in the Expansion Premises or the performance of any work or activities by Tenant prior to the delivery of possession of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; or (v) failure by Tenant to pay any excess Total Construction Costs over the Tenant Improvement Allowance as invoiced by Landlord. cost of construction, including: labor and materials, architectural, engineering, design, and construction management fees, fees for permits and inspection, tap fees, connection fees and all other hard costs directly related to completion of Landlords Work (Total Construction Costs). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Oxford Design Build, an affiliate of Landlord (the General Contractor), shall be the general contractor for all of Landlords Work, and their construction management fee shall be limited to nine (9%) of the hard costs of the Landlords Work (expressly excluding architectural, engineering, and design fees). In the event the Construction Costs Estimate exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay one-half of the difference to Landlord upon execution by Tenant of this Amendment (Construction Deposit). If the Total Construction Costs of Landlords Work is more than the Tenant Improvement Allowance but less than the sum of the Construction Deposit plus the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Landlord shall refund Tenant the amount by which the Construction Deposit plus Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeded the Total Construction Cost as a credit toward Base Rent. If the Total Construction Costs are less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Landlord shall refund the Construction Deposit received as a credit toward Base Rent, and the remaining difference shall be forfeited with no further obligation of Landlord therefore. Revenue earned under our U.S. Army funded research grant was $509,000 for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $78,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2011. Net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Reduced financial loss from operations to $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.1 million for same period last year. Engaged global contract research organization Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) to manage STOP-TBI Phase IIb trial for Oxycyte PFC Emulsion. Oxygen Biotherapeutics reported net revenue of $514,872 for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $95,159 for the comparable quarter in the previous fiscal year. Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the quarter, we recorded approximately $170,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year. General and administrative expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $369,550 compared to $1,526,775 for the same period in 2011. Research and development expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $604,574 compared to $488,577 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $874,435 compared to $875,695 for the same period in 2011. For the second quarter ended October 31, 2012, the Company reported a net loss of $1,557,278, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,929,923, or $0.12 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Total net revenue for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $786,968 compared to total revenue of $120,032 for the same period in fiscal year 2012. Total operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $3,145,252 compared to $4,602,337 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses. General and administrative expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,593,734 compared to $3,098,431for the same period in 2011. The reduction in general and administrative expense for the period was due primarily to decreases in compensation costs, legal and professional fees, facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, during the period, we reduced our estimate of potential costs associated with our contingent liability, related to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, by approximately $530,000. Research and development expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,241,846 compared to $1,140,538 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $2,785,535 compared to $1,316,687 for the same period in 2011. The increase in interest and other expenses for the period was due primarily to the non-cash interest charges for dividends and fair value adjustments on our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock that was not incurred in the prior year, partially offset by the non-cash interest charges for the accretion of the discount on our notes payable which were not incurred in the current period. The Company reported a net loss of $5,143,819, or $0.17 per share for the six month period ended October 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $5,798,992, or $0.25 per share for the same period in 2011. As of October 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,511,513, compared to $1,879,872 at April 30, 2012. Our company's focus is reflected in our financial results and we remain committed to investing a substantial amount of our resources on development of the programs that will lead us to success and build stockholder value.\" The company has developed a proprietary perfluorocarbon (PFC) therapeutic oxygen carrier called Oxycyte® that is currently in clinical and preclinical studies for intravenous delivery for indications such as traumatic brain injury, decompression sickness and stroke.

We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We are expensing costs associated with the manufacture of our lebrikizumab product candidate. We review all inventory balances on a quarterly basis for impairment and recognize any reduction in value as a current period expense with a reserve provision on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under certain collaborative arrangements, we have been reimbursed for a portion of our research and development (“R&D”) expenses, including costs of drug supplies. When these R&D services are performed under a reimbursement or cost sharing model with our collaboration partner, we record these reimbursements as a reduction of R&D expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for dilutive potential shares of common stock. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. We expect the implementation of Topic 842 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as we had aggregate future minimum lease payments of approximately $21.6 million as of June 30, 2018. We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. In connection with the acquisition of Valocor Therapeutics, Inc. (“Valocor”) in 2011, we acquired intangible assets that were associated with in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects relating to preclinical product candidates. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. Under Topic 606, we evaluated the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement and the transfer of intellectual property rights (the “license”) was identified as the only performance obligation as of the inception of the agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. Future potential milestone amounts would be recognized as revenue from collaboration arrangements, if unconstrained. Reimbursable program costs are recognized proportionately with the performance of the underlying services or delivery of drug substance and are accounted for as reductions to R&D expense and are excluded from the transaction price. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. The Transition Agreement, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors. In consideration for the repurchase of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, UCB paid us $11.0 million in November 2017 and an additional $39.0 million in June 2018 upon FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis. We are obligated to reimburse UCB for up to $10.0 million of development costs incurred by UCB in connection with the development of Cimzia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. If the aggregate development costs reimbursed by us to UCB during this six-month period are less than $10.0 million, we will pay UCB the difference between such aggregate costs and $10.0 million. These terms replace the provisions of the UCB Agreement pursuant to which we would have been eligible to recoup our external development costs incurred related to the Cimzia program, net of milestones received, through a royalty on future net sales of Cimzia. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $39.0 million milestone amount payable upon the approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in the United States was initially not included in the transaction price, as it was determined to be fully constrained. Upon UCB’s receipt of FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in June 2018, the $39.0 million milestone payment was included in the transaction price and fully recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as all performance obligations were satisfied. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement (“Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”), pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting interleukin 13, for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and a $25.0 million payment to Roche in July 2018 upon the achievement of 50% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab, which was achieved in June 2018, and will make an additional payment to Roche in 2018 for $30.0 million within thirty days after the earlier of December 15, 2018 or the achievement of 100% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for all indications. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement includes a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. As of June 30, 2018, we have paid or accrued license and other fees of $1.8 million to Rose U and are required to pay additional amounts totaling up to $3.1 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, commercialization and other milestones under these agreements to Rose U and Stiefel, including a $2.5 million payment due within thirty days after the first commercial sale of QBREXZA. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. We are entitled to credit the $2.5 million milestone payment against future royalty payments owed to Rose U and Stiefel in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. The interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and other disclosures (including the disclosures under “Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”) pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (the “Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Achieved 50% patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab in June 2018, triggering a $25.0 million milestone payment, which was paid in July 2018. The clinical study is a Phase 2b dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Received a payment of $39.0 million from UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”) in June 2018 in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in May 2018. The payment is pursuant to a transition agreement (“Transition Agreement”) that provided for an orderly transition of activities under the development and commercialisation agreement between us and UCB, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided for the development and commercialization of Cimzia, an injectable biologic tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $38.0 million to $39.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 25% to $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $37.2 million to $39.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 2% to $45.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. We expect to incur significant costs to continue to build out our infrastructure, prepare for the commercial launch of QBREXZA, recently approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older product, and continue to advance our lebrikizumab product candidate through clinical development. The timing and the amount of future funding we will require, and the success of our business, will be based in large part on the successful commercialization of QBREXZA. We currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration or license agreements. Cost estimation in software engineering is typically concerned with the financial spend on the effort to develop and test the software, this can also include requirements review, maintenance, training, managing and buying extra equipment, servers and software. Many methods have been developed for estimating software costs for a given project.\n\n"
