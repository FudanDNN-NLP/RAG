The divergence time between the Neanderthal and modern human lineages is estimated at between 750,000 and 400,000 years ago. Neanderthals inhabited much of Europe and western Asia from as far back as 130,000 years ago. They were eventually replaced by anatomically modern humans (AMH; sometimes known as Cro-Magnons), who began to appear in Europe circa 40,000 years ago. The question was resolved only in 2010, when it was established that Eurasian populations exhibit Neanderthal admixture, estimated at 1.5–2.1% on average.\n\n"
