If a is algebraic over K, then K(a), the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: K(a) is an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is not true. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice. An extension L/K is algebraic if and only if every sub K-algebra of L is a field. For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers. Let E \n\n The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension. If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p(x) be some irreducible polynomial in F[x]. Then the quotient of F[x] modulo the ideal generated by p(x) is an algebraic extension of F whose degree is equal to the degree of p(x). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of p(x) is 1. On the other hand, if F has some proper algebraic extension K, then the minimal polynomial of an element in K \\ F is irreducible and its degree is greater than 1.\n\n is easy to check that every complex number has a complex square root, thus every complex polynomial of degree 2 has a complex root by the quadratic formula.

For example, if G is any non-trivial group, then the product G × G has a diagonal subgroup which is not the direct product of two subgroups of G . Then πG and πH are homomorphisms, known as projection homomorphisms, whose kernels are H and G , respectively. In the case where G × H is a finite group, it follows that the composition factors of G × H are precisely the union of the composition factors of G and the composition factors of H . Given a group G and a subgroup H, and an element a ∈ G, one can consider the corresponding left coset: aH := { ah : h ∈ H }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group G of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup H of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: 0 + H, which are the even integers, and 1 + H, which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation). For a general subgroup H, it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { aH : a ∈ G }. A subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if the coset equality aN = Na holds for all a ∈ G. A normal subgroup of G is denoted N ◁ G.\n\n derived subgroup is regular.

It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is \"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them\". The properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. For a nontrivial group G, we have rank(G) = 1 if and only if G is a cyclic group. The trivial group T has rank(T) = 0, since the minimal generating set of T is the empty set. This means G has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3. But the order of G is only 30, so a simple group of order \n\n of n, then the number of elements in Z/nZ which have order d is φ(d), and the number of elements whose order divides d is exactly d. If G is a finite group in which, for each n > 0, G contains at most n elements of order dividing n, then G must be cyclic. For example, Z/12Z is isomorphic to the direct product Z/3Z × Z/4Z under \n\n order n, gn is the identity element for any element g. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since kn ≡ 0 (mod n) for every integer k. (This is also true for a general group of order n, due to Lagrange's theorem.) The fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that every finitely generated abelian group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.

In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on G that map K to the identity element. Therefore, by setting we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem.
