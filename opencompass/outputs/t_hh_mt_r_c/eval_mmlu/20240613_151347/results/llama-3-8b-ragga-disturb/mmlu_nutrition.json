While genetics can predispose individuals to obesity, they cannot fully explain the significant rise in obesity rates seen worldwide. One factor that has contributed to the increase in obesity rates is changes in dietary patterns. The availability and affordability of high-calorie, processed foods have increased, leading to a higher consumption of unhealthy food choices. This shift towards a more calorie-dense diet, coupled with larger portion sizes and increased snacking, has contributed to excess calorie intake. Additionally, urbanization and changes in transportation patterns have played a role in the global increase in obesity rates. The complex interplay between genetic factors, environmental influences, cultural norms, socioeconomic status, and individual behaviors all contribute to the global rise in obesity rates. Overall, while genetic influences play a role in obesity, it is clear that shifts in dietary patterns towards high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization, and changes in transportation patterns are major contributors to the global increase in obesity rates. One major factor is the consumption of inflammatory foods. This combination of toxic foods leads to chronic inflammation and ultimately, disease. Additionally, the easy availability and affordability of processed and fast foods play a significant role in the epidemic. These foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars, which contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of developing diabetes. It is important to note that these factors are interrelated and can exacerbate each other. Addressing the epidemic requires a holistic approach that includes promoting a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, and raising awareness about the risks associated with diabetes and obesity. Causes cited for the growing rates of obesity in the United Kingdom are multiple and the degree of influence of any one factor is often a source of debate. At an individual level, a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity is thought to explain most cases of obesity. Between the years 1980 and 2000, obesity rates doubled among young children and tripled among teens. Many studies have been conducted to provide insight into whether genetics are to blame, or economic and environmental circumstances. According to the \"thrifty gene hypothesis\", a common genetic theory for rising obesity rates is that some people are genetically predisposed to more efficiently metabolize food than others. In times of scarcity, these genes were essential in ensuring survival, and in times of abundance, cause obesity. The tendency to be sedentary and increasing rates of sugar and fat consumption are also linked to obesity prevalence. The propensity for children to be \n\nSome factors that contribute to the increasing rates of obesity in South Africa include:\n\n1. Unhealthy Diet: The consumption of processed and fast foods high in calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars has become more prevalent in South Africa. Socioeconomic Factors: Poverty and income inequality play a role in obesity rates. The availability of affordable, nutritious food options can be limited in low-income communities, leading to reliance on cheap, energy-dense foods that contribute to weight gain. Lack of Awareness and Education: Limited knowledge about nutrition and healthy lifestyles may contribute to unhealthy food choices and a lack of exercise.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about nutrition.

Atrophic gastritis is a condition where the stomach lining becomes thin and inflamed, leading to a decrease in intrinsic factor production. Small bowel resection involves surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine, which can result in reduced absorption of vitamin B12. These conditions interfere with the normal process of absorbing vitamin B12 from food sources, leading to a deficiency if not properly addressed. Reference:\n- Pernicious anemia (also called Addison's anemia) is a type of red blood cell disorder caused by impaired vitamin B12 metabolism. Vitamin B12 is primarily absorbed by the small intestine, after being bound to intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa. When this process is disrupted by conditions like atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, small bowel resection etc., B12 deficiency ensues. Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia. Substantial numbers of patients with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems in the absence of or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria. Type A gastritis primarily affects the body/fundus of the stomach and is more common with pernicious anemia.Type B gastritis primarily affects the antrum, and is more common with H. pylori infection. That said, symptomatic patients are mostly females and signs of atrophic gastritis are those associated with iron deficiency: fatigue, restless legs syndrome, brittle nails, hair loss, impaired immune function, and impaired wound healing. Although, atrophic gastritis impairs iron and vitamin B12 absorption, iron deficiency will be found at a younger age and many years before the development of pernicious anemia. Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) is due to environmental factors, such as diet and H. pylori infection. The inadequate production of intrinsic factor also leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption and pernicious anemia. Achlorhydria induces G cell (gastrin-producing) hyperplasia, which leads to hypergastrinemia.

The epidemiologic literature clearly suggests that the increased bioavailability of sex steroids that accompanies increased adiposity is strongly associated with risk of endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancers (Kaaks et al. 2002) and may impact colon and other cancers as well. Overweight women are known to have increased risk of endometrial cancer and breast cancer after menopause due to increased levels of circulating estrogen. Obesity is associated with increased insulin levels, which lead to increases in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activity and, in some individuals, an increased androgen production by the ovaries. Increased adiposity also increases aromatase activity, leading to increased levels of bioavailable oestrogen levels in postmenopausal women. 18.2\n\nEffect of obesity on hormones and endometrial cancer.

The most demanding essential amino acid requirements are for infants, and as children get older and transition into adulthood, the less proportions of essential amino acids they will need. The essential amino acid requirements for infants is based on the essential amino acid proportions in human breast milk. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” pediatric formula) is indicated for the nutritional support of infants (including those of low birth weight) and young children requiring TPN via either central or peripheral infusion routes. Parenteral nutrition with Aminosyn-PF 10% is indicated to prevent nitrogen and weight loss or treat negative nitrogen balance in infants and young children where (1) the alimentary tract by the oral gastrostomy, or jejunostomy route, cannot or should not be used or adequate protein intake is not feasible by these routes; (2) gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired; or (3) protein requirements are substantially increased as with extensive burns. Dosage, route of administration, and concomitant infusion of non-protein calories are dependent on various factors, such as nutritional and metabolic status of the patient, anticipated duration of parenteral nutrition support, and vein tolerance. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, is an amino acid injection-pediatric formula not intended for direct infusion. The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn-PF 10% is up to 2.5 g amino acid/kg/day for infants up to 10 kg. For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids/day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1.0 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg. Initial amino acid dosage levels of 1.0 g/kg/day may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 g/kg/day to approximate desired intake levels. Nonprotein calories should constitute approximately 100 to 130 kcal/kg/day. Part of the nonprotein caloric requirement may be provided as lipid emulsion administered concurrently to provide up to 60% of daily calories at a dose not to exceed 4 g fat/kg/day. Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged (more than 5 days) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid for infants, especially preterm infants with potentially immature enzyme pathways. Therefore, addition of a cysteine supplement to the TPN admixture is recommended. The intake of cysteine by the preterm infant ingesting maternal milk is approximately 78 mg/kg/day. The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn-PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP). Bicarbonate should not be administered during infusion of the nutritional solution unless deemed absolutely necessary. Hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava. In addition to meeting protein needs, the rate of administration, particularly during the first few days of therapy, is governed by the patient's glucose tolerance. Daily intake of amino acids and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of glucose levels in blood and urine. The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture. Aminosyn -PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” pediatric formula) is supplied as a Pharmacy Bulk Package in 1000 mL flexible plastic containers List 4179. Local reactions consisting of erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids particularly if other substances, such as antibiotics, are also administered through the same site. FREQUENT EVALUATION AND LABORATORY DETERMINATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR PROPER MONITORING OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION. Studies should include blood sugar, serum proteins, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, hemogram, carbon dioxide content, serum osmolalities, blood cultures, and blood ammonia levels. It is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants. Conservative doses of amino acids should be given, dictated by the nutritional status of the patient. The effect of infusion of amino acids, without dextrose, upon carbohydrate metabolism of children is not known at this time. It is essential to provide adequate exogenous dextrose calories concurrently with amino acids. Correction of this ketonemia may be achieved by the administration of carbohydrate. Peripheral administration of Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” pediatric formula) requires appropriate dilution and provision of adequate calories. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no added phosphorus. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” pediatric formula) is contraindicated in patients with untreated anuria, hepatic coma, inborn errors of amino acid metabolism (including those involving branched chain amino acid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease and isovaleric acidemia), or hypersensitivity to one or more amino acids present in the solution. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” pediatric formula) contains a mixture of essential and nonessential amino acids as well as taurine. The amino acid composition has been specifically formulated to provide a well-tolerated nitrogen source for nutritional support and therapy for infants and young children. When administered in conjunction with a cysteine hydrochloride additive, Aminosyn-PF 10% results in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating a profile consistent with that of a breast-fed infant. The rationale for Aminosyn-PF 10% is based on the observation of inadequate levels of essential amino acids in the plasma of infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) using conventional amino acid solutions. Clinical studies in infants who required TPN therapy showed that infusion of Aminosyn-PF 10% resulted in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating those of normal breast or formula fed infants. When infused with hypertonic dextrose as a calorie source, supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals, Aminosyn-PF 10% provides TPN for infants and young children, with the exception of essential fatty acids. The amounts of sodium and acetate in Aminosyn-PF 10% are not of clinical significance. In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12).Humans must consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day because an equivalent amount of amino acids is oxidized or used for the synthesis of nonprotein compounds. 34.10 Protein and amino acid content and turnover in a healthy adult. ### 4.2 Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids\n\nHumans cannot synthesize His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, or Val; therefore, these amino acids are called essential (or indispensable) amino acids. For growing children, this list has to be expanded; they must consume Arg because they commonly do not produce enough of it in the urea cycle (see Section 2.5 in Chapter 35) and Cys because they do not make enough of it from methionine (see Sections 4.1 and  in Chapter 36). Gln, Tyr, Gly, Pro, and ornithine are conditionally essential amino acids; that is, they are essential in certain disease conditions. For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12). In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For people who eat mostly a vegan diet, methionine is usually the limiting essential amino acid.Adults should consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day.For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum intake of 0.75 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day; this protein should have a good balance of amino acids. In addition, cysteine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids, and taurine a semiessential aminosulfonic acid in children. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the nonstandard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.
