Fertility rates remain high, causing the overall population size to grow. According to population momentum, even if high fertility rates were immediately replaced with replacement level fertility rates, the population would continue to grow due to the pre-childbearing population entering childbearing years. Population momentum impacts the immediate birth and death rates in the population that determine the natural rate of growth. Fertility rates must level off to the replacement rate (the net reproduction rate should be 1). If the fertility rate remains higher than the replacement rate, the population would continue to grow. Population momentum is a consequence of the demographic transition. Population momentum explains why a population will continue to grow even if the fertility rate declines. Population momentum occurs because it is not only the number of children per woman that determine population growth, but also the number of women in reproductive age. Eventually, when the fertility rate reaches the replacement rate and the population size of women in the reproductive age bracket stabilizes, the population achieves equilibrium and population momentum comes to an end. Population momentum has implications for population policy for a number of reasons. With respect to high-fertility countries (for example in the developing world), a positive population momentum, meaning that the population is increasing, states that these countries will continue to grow despite large and rapid declines in fertility. With respect to lowest-low fertility countries (for example in Europe), a negative population momentum implies that these countries may experience population decline even if they try to increase their rate of fertility to the replacement rate of 2.1. Population momentum can become negative if the fertility rate is under replacement level for a long period of time. Because population momentum occurs when a population continues to grow despite the replacement fertility level being met, a disproportionality is created where children begin to outnumber older generations.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school geography.

The equation takes into account distance (r), mutation rate (k), and the standard deviation of migration (σ). The kinship coefficient decreases as a function of distance and if a mutation occurs in either locus or if the gamete kinship chain is zero, the kinship coefficient will be zero. Alteration in neighborhood size is alteration in dispersal variance and alteration corresponds to alteration in the variance of the probability of distribution associated with migration probabilities. Both dispersal variance and migration probabilities contribute to local genetic differentiation. They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80 km apart. Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source. In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1). One of the more confusing issues involves identifying sources and sinks in the field. Runge et al. One study showed that even at the fastest rate, the decline was still linear.

For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land then men. One other factor that plays into women's land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. Research on women's participation in \n\n According to the US Census in 1861, one third of women were in the labor force and of these one fourth were married women. According to Ellen DuBoise and Lynn Dumenil, they estimate that the number of women in the labor force from 1800 - 1900 are: According to the US Department of Labor, as of 2017 women make up 47% of the total labor force with 70% of them mothers with children under 18 years of age. Claudia Goldin and others, specifically point out that by the mid-1970s there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by different factors. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force, choosing more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the labor force participation rate rose from approximately 59% in 1948 to 66% in 2005, with participation among women rising from 32% to 59% and participation among men declining from 87% to 73%.

The major motivations for rural-urban migration in the case study of Uttarakhand, India, were primarily related to education, employment opportunities, and access to facilities. The push factors, such as problems in the village and declining environment or agriculture, did exist but were not mentioned as significant personal reasons for migration. Instead, the push factors were frequently confirmed as major problems in the village. On the other hand, the pull factors, including education, employment opportunities, and better facilities in the city, were perceived as major reasons for migration. Instead, the findings suggest that it was the differences in socio-economic opportunities, rather than environmental factors, that primarily drove people to migrate to the city. Overall, the motivations for rural-urban migration in the case study of Uttarakhand, India, were largely driven by education, employment opportunities, and access to better facilities, rather than environmental factors. Push factors motivating Christians to emigrate include religious discrimination, persecution, and cleansing. Pull factors include prospects of upward mobility as well as joining relatives abroad. The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations.

This fan was created by the Wallowa River transporting debris into the valley. Though the number of glaciers that formed the moraines is debated, the most accepted hypothesis is that eight or nine glaciers formed the walls that now dam the lake. The last glacier advanced into the valley about 17,000 years ago and is known as the Wallowa Glacier. Near Glacier Lake, high in the surrounding mountains, is evidence of several subsequent glacier advances. The earliest of these was 11,000&ndash;10,000 years before present. Alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks. The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous crevasses, often invisible under new snowfall, which cause the greatest danger to \n\n In the Miocene Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation, which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist Louis Agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his Neuchâtel home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland. Because of his work he came to be known as the \"father of the ice-age concept\" although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas.

Due to the nature of agricultural work as being seasonal and transient, the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high. Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker. 1) May not be able to join a union or face legal challenges ; 2) Requirements that farmers may not meet because of the program In the agriculture sector, the most common victims of trafficking are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, undocumented immigrants, and foreign nationals with temporary H-2A visas.

From the twentieth century, intensive agriculture increased productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements.

Research suggests that successful human populations tend to originate from lands with many valleys and relatively low land fertility, which are situated close to areas of high land fertility. Additionally, the availability of resources such as water, fertile soil, and natural habitats for hunting and gathering can contribute to the success of human populations. Access to trade routes and proximity to transportation networks can also play a role in facilitating the growth and dominance of populations. Factors such as innovative technologies, efficient farming techniques, effective social organization, and adaptive strategies can contribute to the emergence and dominance of a population within their geographical environment. Lowland areas and areas close to water transports were highly urbanized first, but as population increased along with trade and manufacturing, imperial expansion and colonization of conquered territories was needed. The environment underwent drastic degradation as pollution from the burning of fuelwood filled the air and smelters that used wood as fuel transmitted heavy metals into the atmosphere. The creation of large cities contributed to deforestation in the classical world. Overcrowding forced citizens to move to the hillsides where forests once stood to build their homes. With such a large population increase, coupled with an enhancement of exuberant lifestyles and a high standard of living for the urbanized communities of the Roman world, resource consumption increased. These efforts were made under the terms of a trading monopoly granted by King Henry IV of France in 1603 to Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, and resulted in the establishment of the Habitation at Port-Royal in Acadia (near present-day Annapolis \n\n Shipbuilding was a major contributor to deforestation and was of great economic and military significance. The importance attached to the supply of timber for building ships cannot be denied; ships were crucial to the burgeoning economic life of the Mediterranean, and sea power was vital in the exercise of political control. Warships had priority over merchant vessels in competition for materials. Transportation was expensive, but increasing numbers of ships were needed to maintain naval dominance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school geography.

Demographic transition refers to the process of shifting from high birth rates and death rates to low birth rates and death rates in a population. This is often seen in agrarian societies where high birth rates are necessary to support agricultural labor demands and compensate for high infant mortality rates. These factors may include increased access to contraception, changing cultural norms, improved education and career opportunities for women, and a shift from agricultural to industrial economies. Eventually, birth rates decline to a level where they are similar to or lower than death rates, resulting in a stabilized population growth rate. In the first stage, both birth rates and death rates are high, resulting in slow population growth. The second stage is characterized by a decrease in death rates while birth rates remain high, leading to rapid population growth. In the fourth and final stage, both birth rates and death rates are low, resulting in a stable population size. According to the demographic cycle, a population can go through various stages, including the pre-industrial stage, transitional stage, industrial stage, and post-industrial stage. As a society transitions into the transitional stage, there is improved healthcare and living conditions, leading to a decrease in death rates. In the industrial stage, birth rates start to decline due to factors such as urbanization, increased access to education, and contraception. Finally, in the post-industrial stage, both birth rates and death rates are low, resulting in a low population growth rate or even population decline. It is important to note that each country may progress through these stages at different rates, depending on factors such as economic development, healthcare infrastructure, and social changes. Stage II of the demographic cycle is characterized by a significant decline in death rates, while birth rates remain relatively high. This transition occurs as societies undergo various improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living conditions. Despite the decline in death rates, birth rates remain high during this stage, resulting in a rapid population growth.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school geography.

The indicator used to determine the complete family size is known as the total fertility rate (TFR). The total fertility rate provides a measure of the average number of children a woman is expected to have throughout her reproductive years. The total fertility rate is typically calculated by summing up the age-specific fertility rates for different age groups, often ranging from 15 to 49 years. By using this measure, demographers and researchers are able to estimate the average number of live births a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their reproductive lifespan. A total fertility rate below the replacement level, generally considered to be around 2.1 children per woman, indicates that a population is not replacing itself and may experience a decline in the long term. On the other hand, a TFR above the replacement level suggests population growth. It's important to note that the total fertility rate is influenced by various social, cultural, economic, and individual factors. However, the total fertility rate remains a vital tool in understanding population dynamics and projecting future population growth or decline. MacDonald noted that the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). by CIA World Factbook), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision) coming from 3.1 in 1960. In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school geography.

However, suburbanization through urban exodus and automobile culture, and modern construction techniques and equipment have created a demand for homes on and around the once undeveloped Metacomet Ridge and its surrounding exurban communities. At the same time, the boom in interest in \n\n When culs-de-sac are interconnected with foot and bike paths, as for example in Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes in Davis, California, they can increase active modes of mobility among their residents. Real estate developers prefer culs-de-sac because they allow builders to fit more houses into oddly-shaped tracts of land and facilitate building to the edges of rivers and property lines. They also choose these discontinuous network patterns of cul-de-sac and loop streets because of the often significant economies in infrastructure costs compared to the grid plan. From an environmental perspective, culs-de-sac allow greater flexibility than the common grid in adapting to the natural grades of a site \n\n Another area of criticism comes from the fact that, since a green belt does not extend indefinitely outside a city, it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed, thereby actually increasing urban sprawl. It also means people have to commute through the \n\n The field of urban design holds enormous potential for helping us address today's biggest challenges: an expanding population, mass urbanization, rising inequality, and climate change.

Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana \n\n  Hinduism's varied history overlaps or coincides with the development of religion in the Indian subcontinent since the Iron Age, with some of its traditions tracing back to prehistoric religions such as those of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. The history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley Civilization and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE. This period \n\n Hinduism, known endonymically as Sanatan Dharm, is often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, with roots tracing back to prehistoric times, over 5,000 years ago. Hinduism spread through parts of Southeastern Asia, China, and Afghanistan. And in Hinduism, Sanatan Dharm is considered the grandmother of all philosophies. Post western influence, Hinduism, over years has been type-cast as a religion. Although Hinduism is a little-practiced religion in Japan, it has still had a significant, but indirect role in the formation of Japanese culture. This is mostly because many Buddhist beliefs and traditions (which share a common Indian root with Hinduism) spread to Japan from China via Korean peninsula in the 6th century.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school geography.

While such developments often occurred on farmland or other cleared sites, the evidence of the street trees planted can be seen today in the large, overarching canopies found in these attractive post-turn-of-the-20th-century communities. In a greater sense, the streetcar suburbs of the early 20th century worked well for a variety of reasons. While most cities grew in a piecemeal fashion, without any real plan for future development, streetcar suburbs were highly planned communities that were organized under single ownership and control. Indeed, they would often be the first such developments in their respective cities. ; Most streetcar suburbs were laid out in a grid plan, although designers of these suburbs often modified the grid pattern to suit the site context with curvilinear streets.

Housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major difference from suburban living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures, as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas. Urban residents are also more likely to travel by mass transit, and children are more likely to walk or cycle rather than being driven by their parents. As in the cities, children attend school up to and including high school and only help with farming during the summer months or after school.
