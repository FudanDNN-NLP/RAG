Similarly, the Nyquist stability criterion also indicates instability but is silent about oscillation. Apparently there is not a compact formulation of an oscillation criterion that is both necessary and sufficient. The amplifier will oscillate if it has a gain of one or more at this critical frequency. A more precise statement of this is the following: An operational amplifier will oscillate at the frequency at which its open loop gain equals its closed loop gain if, at that frequency,  \n\n 360°, i.e., the output will have a phase angle of &minus;360°. Spontaneous oscillation will be excited in the tuned circuit at its resonant frequency, sustained by the power from the amplifier. This is how feedback oscillators such as Hartley or Colpitts oscillators work. All linear oscillator circuits have negative resistance  although in most feedback oscillators the tuned circuit is an integral part of the feedback network, so the circuit does not have negative resistance at all frequencies but only near the oscillation frequency.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about electrical engineering.

Rated voltage is applied at primary. If the applied voltage is normal voltage then normal flux will be set up.

After reaching at rated current  of HV side, all three instruments reading (Voltmeter, Ammeter and Watt-meter readings) are recorded. The ammeter reading gives the primary equivalent of full load current IL. As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the iron losses in transformer can be taken as negligible here. the detector (an AC voltmeter or ammeter)) and hence no current flowing through it.

Sheffer in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called Sheffer stroke; the logical NOR is sometimes called Peirce's arrow. Consequently, these gates are sometimes called universal logic gates. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates.

Due to the lower logical effort, NAND gates are typically preferred to NOR gates. The two main types of flash memory, NOR flash and NAND flash, are named for the NOR and NAND logic gates. NOR and NAND flash use the same cell design, consisting of floating gate MOSFETs. In NAND flash, the relationship between the bit line and the word lines resembles a NAND gate; in NOR flash, it resembles a NOR gate. Each standard cell represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about electrical engineering.

By controlling the phase angle or trigger angle, the output RMS voltage of the load can be varied. The thyristor is turned on for every half-cycle and switched off for each remaining half-cycle. The phase angle is the position at which the thyristor is switched on. triodes for alternating current are often used instead of thyristors to perform the same function for better efficiency. If the load is a combination of resistance and inductance, the current cycle lags the voltage cycle, decreasing overall power output. However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors and between two conductors of the same phase. ; 2) Current is converted to  coordinate system to (a,b,c) coordinate system or fed in Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) modulator, or both, for signaling to the power inverter section. ; The switching frequency of the transistors is usually constant and set by the modulator.

Generally, devices for dynamic voltage restoration employ gate turn off thyristors, (GTO) solid state power electronic switches in a pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverter structure. In other words, the DVR is a solid state DC to AC switching power converter that injects a set of three-phase AC output voltages in series and synchronicity with the distribution and transmission line voltages.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about electrical engineering.

At the metal surface of the electrically grounded collection plate, the voltage is zero, whereas at the outer surface of the dust layer, where new particles and ions are arriving, the electrostatic voltage caused by the gas ions can be quite high. Once the top plate with the positively charged surface starts to slide outward, the in-plane charge separation is initiated due to the decrease in contact surface area.

For example, in low current and high resistance applications, unshielded cabling can introduce leakage currents that will degrade measurement accuracy. In such resistors, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result. To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. To measure such resistances requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances.

The DCO was seen at the time as an improvement over the unstable tuning of VCOs. However, it shared the same ramp core, and the same limited range of waveforms. Although sophisticated analogue waveshaping is possible, the greater simplicity and arbitrary waveforms of digital systems like direct digital synthesis led to most later instruments adopting entirely digital oscillator designs. Because the design of the device does not depend on a resonant response, it should not be considered a harmonic oscillator. Typically, such circuits must operate at radio frequency and power levels, which imposes special constraints on their design. These constraints increase in their importance with higher frequencies. In most modern transmitters, this is a crystal oscillator in which the frequency is precisely controlled by the vibrations of a quartz crystal. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

ERH consists of constructing electrodes in the ground, applying alternating current (AC) electricity to the electrodes and heating the subsurface to temperatures that promote the evaporation of contaminants. Volatilized contaminants are captured by a subsurface vapor recovery system and conveyed to the surface along with recovered air and steam. Electrical resistance heating (ERH) is an intensive in situ environmental remediation method that uses the flow of alternating current electricity to heat soil and groundwater and evaporate contaminants. ERH is typically more cost effective when used for treating contaminant source areas. It allows fast heating and cooling, but is only suitable for some products. This method achieves near-instantaneous heating and cooling and even distribution of temperature, avoiding local overheating. There are two groups of direct systems:\n\n The contaminated area is depicted by the green shape while the electrodes are depicted by the numbered circles. Six-phase heating consists of six electrodes in a hexagonal pattern with a neutral electrode in the center of the array. In a six-phase heating pattern there can be hot spots and cold spots depending on the phases that are next to each other. For this reason, six-phase heating typically works best on small circular areas that are less than 65 feet in diameter. As the subsurface is heated the hydrolysis half life of the contaminant will decrease as described by the Arrhenius equation.

This is often done by controlling the charging current from the same microprocessor that controls the counter reset value. The reference in this case is the reset pulses. In an RC oscillator circuit, the filter is a network of resistors and capacitors. RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range. Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the phase shift oscillator and the Wien bridge oscillator. In an LC oscillator circuit, the filter is a tuned circuit (often called a tank circuit; the tuned circuit is a resonator) consisting of an inductor (L) and capacitor (C) connected together. Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its resonant frequency.

Some variation of BCDIC alphamerics is used in most early IBM computers, including the IBM 1620 (introduced in 1959), IBM 1400 series, and non-Decimal Architecture members of the IBM 700/7000 series. The IBM 1400 series are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled B, A, 8, 4, 2 and 1, plus an odd parity check bit (C) and a word mark bit (M). For encoding digits 1 through 9, B and A are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits \n\nUnpacked: Each decimal digit is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the number and the remaining bits having no significance. BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four-bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is Natural BCD (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. However, for binary-coded decimal (BCD) values, where each 4-bit nibble represents a decimal digit, addition is more complicated. For example, adding the decimal value 25 and 48, which are encoded as the BCD values 2516 and 4816, the binary addition of the two values produces 6D16. 0010 0101  25 + 0100 1000   48 ---   0110 1101   6D, \n\nConverting optical data from decimal to binary format is significant in optical computing and optical signal processing. This conversion allows for the representation of decimal numbers using binary code systems, such as binary coded decimal (BCD) and gray code, which are commonly used in these fields. BCD is a weighted code system, typically using a 4-bit binary representation, where each decimal digit is represented by a combination of these bits. On the other hand, gray code is a binary numeral system where successive values differ by only 1 bit. These conversions can be achieved through all-optical frequency encoding techniques, providing advantages in terms of reliability and error prevention.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about electrical engineering.

The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available. After dynamos and motors were found to allow easy conversion back and forth between mechanical or electrical power, they were combined in devices called rotary converters, rotating machines whose purpose was not to provide mechanical power to loads but to convert one type of electric current into another, for example DC into AC. They were multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts (either commutators or sliprings, as required), one to provide power to one set of armature windings to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current. This includes converting between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC), three phase and single \n\n A dynamo is an electrical generator that creates direct current using a commutator. Today, the simpler alternator dominates large scale power generation, for efficiency, reliability and cost reasons. This induces a voltage in two of the coils on opposite sides of the armature, which is picked off by the brushes. With more than a few coils on the Gramme ring armature, the resulting voltage waveform is practically constant, thus producing a near direct current supply. ; The switching action of the commutator causes sparking at the contacts, posing a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres, and generating electromagnetic interference. Direct current machines like dynamos and commutated DC motors have higher maintenance costs and power limitations than alternating current (AC) machines due to their use of the commutator.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about electrical engineering.
