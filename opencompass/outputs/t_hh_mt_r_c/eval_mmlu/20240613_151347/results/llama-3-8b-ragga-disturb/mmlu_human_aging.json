The leading contributors to disease burden in older people are cardiovascular diseases (30·3%), malignant neoplasms (15·1%), chronic respiratory diseases (9·5%), musculoskeletal diseases (7·5%), and neurological and mental disorders (6·6%). Some examples of medical specialties and educational programs that focus on the care of older adults include:\n\n1. Geriatrics: Geriatrics is a medical specialty that focuses on the healthcare needs of older adults. Geriatricians are physicians who have specialized postgraduate education and experience in the medical care of older persons. They are trained to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Geriatric Nursing: Geriatric nursing is a specialization within nursing that focuses on providing comprehensive healthcare to elderly adults. Geriatric Nurse Practitioners (GNPs) are registered nurses who have pursued additional education through a master's degree program in nursing. They are trained to deliver primary healthcare to older adults and often work in various settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers. Geriatric Psychiatry: Geriatric psychiatry involves the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders in older adults. They are trained to address conditions such as dementia, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders that commonly affect the elderly population. Geriatric Pharmacy: Geriatric pharmacy focuses on the medication management and optimization for older adults. Pharmacists specializing in geriatrics are trained to understand the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older adults, as well as potential drug interactions and adverse effects that may disproportionately affect this population. Geriatric Rehabilitation: Geriatric rehabilitation aims to improve the physical and functional abilities of older adults who may have experienced age-related decline or have specific conditions such as stroke, arthritis, or hip fracture. This specialty involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and social workers, who work together to develop individualized treatment plans to enhance the quality of life and independence of older adults. These are just a few examples of medical specialties and educational programs that focus on the care of older adults. In the field of geriatrics, there are several specific areas of focus. It focuses on preventing and managing diseases commonly seen in elderly patients, promoting healthy aging, and addressing age-related changes in the body. Geriatric Dentistry: Geriatric dentistry specifically deals with the dental problems faced by older individuals. This branch of dentistry focuses on maintaining oral health, treating dental diseases, and addressing age-related dental issues such as tooth loss, dry mouth, and gum diseases. Geriatric Nursing: Geriatric nursing involves providing specialized nursing care to elderly patients in various settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, and home care. It focuses on addressing the unique physical, mental, and social needs of older adults and promoting their overall well-being. Geriatric Assessment: Geriatric assessment evaluates the overall functioning and well-being of older adults. It assesses physical, cognitive, and psychological capabilities, as well as social support systems. This assessment helps healthcare professionals develop individualized care plans and interventions for elderly patients. These services aim to diagnose and treat age-related diseases, manage chronic conditions, and promote healthy aging through preventive care and health maintenance. These areas of focus in geriatrics aim to provide specialized care and support to the unique needs of older adults, ensuring their overall well-being and quality of life. Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology. Scope\n\nDifferences between adult and geriatric medicine \nGeriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. Geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but kidney failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function. Increased complexity\nThe decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Geriatric giants \nThe so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. Practical concerns\nFunctional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate. Frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Subspecialties and related services \n\nSome diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including:\n\nMedical \n Geriatric cardiology or cardiogeriatrics \n Geriatric dentistry\n Geriatric dermatology \n Geriatric diagnostic imaging\n Geriatric emergency medicine\n Geriatric nephrology \n Geriatric neurology \n Geriatric oncology \n Geriatric physical examination of interest especially to physicians & physician assistants. Geriatric psychiatry or psychogeriatrics (focus on dementia, delirium, depression and other psychiatric disorders)\n Geriatric public health or preventive geriatrics \n Geriatric rehabilitation \n Geriatric rheumatology (focus on joints and soft tissue disorders in elderly)\n Geriatric sexology (focus on sexuality in aged people)\n Geriatric subspeciality medical clinics (such as geriatric anticoagulation clinic, geriatric assessment clinic, falls and balance clinic, continence clinic, palliative care clinic, elderly pain clinic, cognition and memory disorders clinic)\n\nSurgical \n Geriatric orthopaedics or orthogeriatrics (close cooperation with orthopedic surgery and a focus on osteoporosis and rehabilitation). Geriatric cardiothoracic surgery\n Geriatric urology\n Geriatric otolaryngology\n Geriatric general surgery\n Geriatric trauma\n Geriatric gynecology\n Geriatric ophthalmology\n\nOther geriatrics subspecialties \n Geriatric anesthesia (focuses on anesthesia & perioperative care of elderly)\n Geriatric intensive-care unit: (a special type of intensive care unit dedicated to critically ill elderly)\n Geriatric nursing (focuses on nursing of elderly patients and the aged). Geriatric nutrition\n Geriatric occupational therapy\n Geriatric pain management\n Geriatric pharmacy\n Geriatric optometry\n Geriatric physical therapy\n Geriatric podiatry\n Geriatric psychology\n Geriatric speech-language pathology (focuses on neurological disorders such as dysphagia, stroke, aphasia, and traumatic brain injury)\n Geriatric mental health counselor/specialist (focuses on treatment more so than assessment)\n Geriatric audiology\n\nHistory\n\nOne of the eight branches of the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, is jara or rasayana, similar to geriatrics. The term geriatrics was proposed in 1908 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, Laurate of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and later by 1909 by Dr. Ignatz Leo Nascher, former Chief of Clinic in the Mount Sinai Hospital Outpatient Department (New York City) and a \"father\" of geriatrics in the United States. Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people. Another innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the \"giants\" of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Geriatrician training\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation. The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers. United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas others focus on community geriatrics in particular. Although originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialization of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. Unlike in the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom and are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists. can complete a three-year core internal medicine residency program, followed by two years of specialized geriatrics residency training. Doctors of Medicine can opt for a two-year residency program in family medicine and complete a one-year enhanced skills program in care of the elderly. Many universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents. India\nIn India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering. Unfortunately, only eight major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric Medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine. Minimum geriatric competencies\nIn July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP).

            "prompt": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nBackground: In animals, most tests of the terminal investment hypothesis are correlations of age and reproductive effort, immune challenges on all age stages, and immune challenges on older ages versus younger ages. The last type of test is considered to be a more reliable measure of senescence's effect on reproductive effort, as younger individuals should reduce reproductive effort to reduce their chance of death because of their high future reproductive prospects, while older animals should increase effort because of their low future prospects. The Reproductive-Cell Cycle Theory posits that the hormones that regulate reproduction act in an antagonistic pleiotrophic manner to control aging via cell cycle signaling; promoting growth and development early in life in order to achieve reproduction, but later in life, in a futile attempt to maintain reproduction, become dysregulated and drive senescence. This theory suggests that evolution is influenced by the allocation of limited resources to various aspects of life, including development, sexual maturation, reproduction, number of offspring, and senescence and death. Another theory is the disposable soma theory of aging, proposed by Kirkwood and Holliday in 1979. This theory combines several ideas and suggests that an organism has finite resources to allocate between reproduction and maintenance of its body (\"soma\"). The theory argues that resources invested in reproduction reduce the resources available for maintaining the body, resulting in senescence and eventual death. The programmed death theory, proposed by Weissman in 1882, suggests that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to free up environmental resources for younger members of the species after reproduction is completed. For example, genes for sex hormones may be necessary for reproduction in early life but contribute to the risk of cancer in old age. Overall, these theories provide insights into the trade-offs and variations in life history traits among different organisms and help us understand the evolutionary processes that shape the development, reproduction, senescence, and death in living beings.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

Aside from the evidence in favor of a positivity bias, though, there have still been many documented cases of older adults displaying a negativity bias. Positive self-perception of health has been correlated with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly. Various reasons have been proposed for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally rate their health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for socioeconomic status, psychological functioning and health status. Psychologists have examined coping skills in the elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an internal locus of control have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life. Retirement, a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

These findings were independent of age, smoking, alcohol intake, and degree of emotional stress. One group received the usual medical care, while the other received the usual medical care plus weekly ninety-minute group support meetings for one year. Although he planned the study expecting that there would be no difference in life span between the groups, five years later he found that the patients who attended the weekly group support meetings had _twice_ the survival rate of the control group. \"In fact, when age is adjusted for, social isolation is as great or greater a mortality risk than smoking.After controlling for the effects of physical health, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, race, life satisfaction and health care, the studies found that those with few or weak social ties were twice as likely to die as those with strong ties.\" Other research shows that even late in life, potential exists for physical, mental, and social growth and development.
