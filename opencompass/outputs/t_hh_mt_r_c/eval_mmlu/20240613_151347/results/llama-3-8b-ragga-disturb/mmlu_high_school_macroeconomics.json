This has the potential to slow economic growth if inflation, which was caused by a significant increase in aggregate demand and the supply of money, is excessive. By reducing the economy's amount \n\n Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out. So, contractionary fiscal policy measures are employed when unsustainable growth takes place, leading to inflation, high prices of investment, recession and unemployment above the \"healthy\" level of 3%–4%. Depending on the state of the economy, fiscal policy may reach for different objectives: its focus can be to restrict economic growth by mediating inflation or, in turn, increase economic growth by decreasing taxes, encouraging spending on different projects that act as stimuli to economic growth and enabling borrowing and spending. The three stances of fiscal policy are the following: \n\nPrice stability; ; Full employment; ; Economic growth. Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved: The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand, stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place.

In the short run, this increases the real interest rate, which then reduces private investment and increases aggregate demand, placing upward pressure on supply. In neoclassical macroeconomics, the highest sustainable level of aggregate real GDP or \"potential\" is seen as corresponding to a vertical LRAS curve: any increase in the demand for real GDP can only lead to rising prices in the long run, while any increase in output is temporary. In Keynesian theory, increased employment results in increased aggregate demand (AD), which leads to further hiring by firms to increase output. Due to capacity constraints, this increase in output will eventually become so small that the price of the good will rise. At first, unemployment will go down, shifting AD1 to AD2, which increases demand (noted as \"Y\") by (Y2 − Y1). This increase in demand means more workers are needed, and then AD will be shifted from AD2 to AD3, but this time much less is produced than in the previous shift, but the price level has risen from P2 to P3, a much higher increase in price than in the previous shift. Demand-pull inflation is in contrast with cost-push inflation, when price and wage increases are being transmitted from one sector to another. However, these can be considered as different aspects of an overall inflationary process: demand-pull inflation explains how price inflation starts, and cost-push inflation demonstrates why inflation once begun is so difficult to stop. Thus Keynes used the concept of the inflationary gap to show the main determinants that cause an inflationary rise of prices. When an initial increase in aggregate demand produces inflation (so called demand-pull inflation) and real GDP increase, the price level and real GDP are determined at the point where the new aggregate demand and the short-run aggregate supply meet. This point is known as above full-employment equilibrium, since the short-run aggregate supply is above the long-term aggregate supply, i.e.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

This was interpreted as a response to disappointing economic figures in the aftermath of the increase in the consumption tax to 8 percent, inflation has fallen to 1 percent from its peak of 1.5 percent in April. The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken significant action to stimulate the economy after the 2007–2009 recession. The Fed expanded its balance sheet significantly from 2008 to 2014, meaning it essentially \"printed money\" to purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasury bonds. This bids up bond prices, helping keep interest rates low, to encourage companies to borrow and invest and people to buy homes. It planned to end its quantitative easing in October 2014 but was undecided on when it might raise interest rates from near record lows. The deficit expanded primarily due to a severe financial crisis and recession. Keynesian economics argues that when the economic growth is slow, larger budget deficits are stimulative to the economy. This is one reason why the significant deficit reduction represented by the fiscal cliff was expected to result in a recession. The price of gold, in turn, dropped after days of increasing for the same reason. In like measure, traditional safe haven assets such as sovereign bonds and gold were higher.

This is because at a lower interest rate, more people will expect a rise in the interest rate (and thus a fall in aftermarket bond prices). the speculative balances will be greater at a lower interest rate. In economic theory, specifically Keynesian economics, speculative demand is one of the determinants of demand for money (and credit), the others being transactions demand and precautionary demand. A rise in interest rates causes aftermarket bond prices to fall, and that implies a capital loss from holding bonds. Thus, people may hold money to avoid the loss from \n\n that may offset the stimulative impact of spending. When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt. When governments fund a deficit with the issuing of government bonds, interest rates can increase across the market, because government borrowing creates higher demand for credit in the financial markets. This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services, either partially or entirely offsetting the direct expansionary impact of the deficit spending, thus diminishing or eliminating the achievement of the objective of a fiscal stimulus.

GDP represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period of time, typically a year. It serves as a key indicator of a country's economic health and is used internationally to compare the relative economic output of different countries. By measuring GDP, policymakers and economists can assess the overall economic activity and productivity of a nation. It includes various components such as consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. GDP can be calculated using either the expenditure approach, income approach, or production approach. Overall, GDP is an essential measure in understanding the economic performance of a country and plays a significant role in economic decision-making and policy formulation. The Gross Domestic Income (GDI) is the total income received by all sectors of an economy within a state.

It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices. Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream economics and has been described as expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently. won't get, but costs can be offset to some extent – or even completely – by benefits. These include: Fund managers also save investors time and effort by: Just as buying the cheapest car or house isn't always the best option; it could be a mistake just to invest in the lowest-cost fund. In general it seems that there is, at best, a positive correlation between the \n\nIf I wait a few years to apply the opportunity cost, the interest rate will increase its value.If, for example, I use $10 to buy a movie ticket instead of depositing the cash in a savings account, the opportunity cost is the interest I would have earned from the $10.Dennis Slamon of UCLA discovered Herceptin, which staves off breast cancer recurrence; Craig Jordan of Northwestern University developed tamoxifen, also for breast cancer, and Brian J. Druker of Oregon Health and Science University shepherded kinase inhibitors, which offer tailored, focused attacks on cancer cells rather than the more diffuse attacks that also ravage healthy tissue. ### THE TUFTS STUDY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATE BY  \nADDING A SPURIOUS \"OPPORTUNITY COST.\" That charge is the \"opportunity cost.\" John Stuart Mill introduced the concept of an opportunity cost as the cost of what one surrenders in one direction in order to pursue an investment in another. Investing in one arena, such as drug design, precludes spending those funds elsewhere, so you lose the benefits posed by the other opportunity. If, for example, I use $10 to buy a movie ticket instead of depositing the cash in a savings account, the opportunity cost is the interest I would have earned from the $10. If I wait a few years to apply the opportunity cost, the interest rate will increase its value.The fact that I also could have doubled it in an hour by playing bingo cannot enter into the calculations, because although there may be more than one alternative way to spend the funds in question, warns Goozner, the opportunity cost is always the value of one choice, not all of them. two extremes exist. For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, expenses, and taxes is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, expenses, and taxes other than transaction expenses are often outside the control of the investment manager. Another important distinction is between the money-weighted return and the time-weighted return. The former is appropriate if the manager determines the timing of inflows in or outflows from the portfolio. The latter is appropriate when the manager is not responsible for the timing of cash inflows into and cash outflows from the portfolio. In a brave new world of increased healthcare scrutiny, the value of each option is only clear in comparison to the alternatives. Opportunities to help our patients get a good value extend beyond those who wish to avoid surgery. It appears that making cost one of those factors would be particularly worthwhile. Prices of OCPs vary by an order of magnitude. Despite routine opportunities to help patients make high value decisions, this is often easier done in theory than practice. Adding cost information to this task creates an extra dimension of complexity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

It represents the hypothetical unemployment rate consistent with aggregate production being at \n\n cyclical shifts in investment sentiments) will cause actual unemployment to continuously deviate from the natural rate, and be partly determined by aggregate demand factors as under a Keynesian view of output determination. Reductions in the natural rate of unemployment must, according to the concept, be achieved through structural policies directed towards an economy's supply side. According to multiple surveys, two-thirds to three-quarters of economists generally agree with the statement, \"There is a natural rate of unemployment to which the economy tends in the long run.\" This level is consistent with aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labor and goods markets. The natural rate of unemployment therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a classical view of determination of activity. If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities, the natural rate of unemployment may feature involuntary unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an efficient, expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium.

On the contrary – if all simultaneously begin to cut down their imports they will have a decline of balance in their current account in the end. If countries undersell each other with devaluations, the danger of currency war grows, consequence of which is a spiral of devaluation. There are significant economic consequences for the country that devalues its currency to address its economic problems. A devaluation in the exchange rate lowers the value of the domestic currency in relation to all other countries, most significantly with its major trading partners. It also makes imports more expensive, providing a disincentive for domestic consumers to purchase imported goods, leading to lower levels of imports (which can benefit domestic producers), but which reduces the real income of consumers.

Real variables such as real income and real GDP are variables that are measured in physical units, while nominal variables such as nominal income and nominal GDP are measured in monetary units. In other words, if the nominal starting income was 100 and there was 10% inflation (general rise in prices, for example, what cost 10 now costs 11), then with nominal income of still 100, one can buy roughly 9% less; so if nominal income was not adjusted for inflation (did not rise by 10%), real income has dropped by approximately 9%. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold. This is a list of cities and states sorted by the CIA-based or World Bank based inflation rate. Inflation rate is defined as the annual percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's consumer prices. Inflation is a positive value in the inflation rate and means a general decrease in purchasing power for the domestic currency in the country in question and a general increase in prices of goods and services compared to the currency -- if the inflation rate is negative, that indicates deflation, a general decrease in prices of goods and services traded for a country's domestic currency. The decline in the value of the U.S. dollar corresponds to price inflation, which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. A consumer price index (CPI) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households. It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. It also makes imports more expensive, providing a disincentive for domestic consumers to purchase imported goods, leading to lower levels of imports (which can benefit domestic producers), but which reduces the real income of consumers. Devaluation tends to improve a country's balance of trade (exports minus imports) by improving the competitiveness of domestic goods in foreign markets while making foreign goods less competitive in the domestic market by becoming more expensive. The combined effect will be to reduce or eliminate the previous net outflow \n\n Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. The increased demand, in turn, causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports. Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved. Monetary policy refers to actions made by central banks that determine the size and growth rate of the money supply available in the economy, and which would result in desired objectives like low inflation, low unemployment, and stable financial systems. The economy's aggregate money supply is the total of The FOMC influences the level of money available to the economy by the following means: Monetary policy directly affects interest rates; it indirectly affects stock prices, wealth, and currency exchange\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

There is great disagreement among economists as to what these rates actually are, while the concept itself of NAIRU is rejected by Post-Keynesians as non-valid. It is unclear whether lowering marginal income tax rates boosts job growth, or whether increasing tax rates slows job creation. Economic theory suggests that (other things equal) tax cuts are a form of stimulus (they increase the budget deficit) and therefore create jobs, much like spending. Some commentators claim that higher taxes lead to lower employment, by reducing the availability of capital to be invested in job-creating enterprises, or by reducing the amount of money available for consumers to use to purchase goods and services, thereby causing a loss of business for purveyors of those goods and services. Other commentators claim that higher taxes lead to higher employment, because governments use those tax revenues to employ government workers, who then purchase goods and services from private businesses, and because governments themselves may act as consumers of goods and services. On local scales, \n\n All factors, which was derived on the tax incidence and competitive market might be used also in the case of market for labor. The key role of the paying the tax burden is still elasticity of the curves. Thus it does not matter, whether the tax is imposed on supplier (households) or companies, which demand the labor as a factor of production. However some economists assumes, that supply curve for the labor is backward-bending. So, if the tax is levied of this type of the market, it reduces the wages and therefore the quantity of labor rises. This analysis adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index or CPI, a measure of inflation based on what is consumed, rather than what is produced.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

(Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on bank reserves, including excess reserves.) Banks may borrow these funds in order to meet the reserves required to back their deposits.

Reserve requirements - specifies a required minimum percentage of deposits in a commercial bank that should be held as a reserve (i.e. as deposits with the Federal Reserve), with the rest available to loan or invest. Higher requirements mean less money loaned or invested, helping keep inflation in check. Raising the federal funds rate earned on those reserves also helps achieve this objective. Banks typically make loans by accepting promissory notes in exchange for credits they make to the borrowers' deposit accounts. Issuing loan proceeds in the form of paper currency and current coins is considered to be a weakness in internal control. Just as taking out a new loan expands the money supply, the repayment of bank loans reduces the money supply. the Bank, which transferred all of its domestic gold reserves to the Treasury under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. The Bank stores the gold at no charge, but charges for handling whenever it is moved. Their models show that, when the difference between short-term interest rates (using three-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (using ten-year Treasury notes) at the end of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved: The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand, stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place.

Keynesian economics argues that when the economic growth is slow, larger budget deficits are stimulative to the economy. Government spending and taxation decisions (fiscal policy) and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa. However such techniques have failed in the past for several reasons. Also, people are many times intelligent enough to realize that economic stimulus packages are due to economic downturns, and therefore they are even more reluctant to spend them. Instead they put them into savings, which can potentially also help spur the economy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

Economist Fischer Black gave the following illustration in 1995. Suppose that the exchange rate between an \"apple\" country where consumers prefer apples, and an \"orange\" country where consumers prefer valuable oranges, is currently 1:1, but will change next year to 2:1 or 1:2 with equal probability. Thus both appear to have benefited from the exchange on average. Competitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. If a consumer is receiving the subsidy, a lower price of a good resulting from the marginal subsidy on consumption increases demand, shifting \n\n use of biofuels under the RFS is expected to reduce annual GHG emissions by 138 million metric tons. ; Increased U.S. Farm Income: By 2022, the expanded market for agricultural products such as corn and soybeans resulting from biofuels production is expected to increase annual net farm income by $13 billion. ; Decreased Corn and soybean exports: The expanded use of corn starch and soybean oil for biofuels is expected to reduce corn exports by 8% and soybean exports by 14% by 2022. ; Increased Cost of Food \n\n The following example shows that, when the open graph property does not hold, equilibrium may fail to exist. There is an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas.

This economy does not have an equilibrium. If the price of bananas is some p > 0 (where the price of apples is normalized to 1), then both agents can afford the bundle (1+p, 0), which is strictly better than their allocation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.

This means that as income increases, there is a higher demand for money, while as inflation rises, the demand for money decreases. It suggests that a real appreciation of the US dollar has a positive effect on money demand, while a real depreciation has a negative effect. This implies that when the value of the US dollar increases relative to the Saudi riyal, there is an increased demand for money, and vice versa. This is because at a lower interest rate, more people will expect a rise in the interest rate (and thus a fall in aftermarket bond prices). As a result, more people will hold their wealth in money rather than bonds, i.e. Governments can use a budget surplus to do two things: Keynesian theory posits that removing spending from the economy will reduce levels of aggregate demand and contract the economy, thus stabilizing prices. The argument mostly centers on crowding out: whether government borrowing leads to higher interest \n\n In economic theory, specifically Keynesian economics, speculative demand is one of the determinants of demand for money (and credit), the others being transactions demand and precautionary demand. A rise in interest rates causes aftermarket bond prices to fall, and that implies a capital loss from holding bonds. Thus, people may hold money to avoid the loss from \n\n The Keynes effect is the effect that changes in the price level have upon goods market spending via changes in interest rates. As prices fall, a given nominal money supply will be associated with a larger real money supply, causing interest rates to fall and in turn causing investment spending on physical capital to increase. The Patinkin-Pigou real balance effect suggests that due to wealth effects of changes in the price level upon spending itself, insufficient demand cannot persist even in the two cases in which the Keynes effect does not operate.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school macroeconomics.
