The size of an IV cannula is denoted by the gauge, or G, which indicates the diameter of the needle. It is important to note that healthcare professionals carefully select the appropriate size of IV cannula based on factors such as the patient's condition, the purpose of the procedure, and the vein accessibility. If you have any specific concerns or further questions about IV cannulas or their sizes, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation. When it comes to managing massive bleeding during surgery, it is important to choose the appropriate sized cannula. One commonly recommended size is a 16 gauge cannula. Using a larger gauge cannula can help ensure sufficient blood flow and prevent further complications. However, the specific size of the cannula may vary based on the surgical procedure and the patient's condition. It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or an anesthesiologist who can assess the situation and make an informed decision regarding the appropriate cannula size for the surgery.

Respiratory symptoms are also common in anaphylaxis. Additional symptoms can involve nasal congestion, sneezing, ocular itching and tearing, abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, incontinence, pelvic pain and uterine cramping, headache, or a sense of impending doom. During a physical examination, healthcare providers may observe tachypnea (rapid breathing), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and hypotension. It is important to note that anaphylaxis can present differently among individuals, and not all manifestations may be present in every case. Common symptoms include:\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can involve multiple systems in the body. The progression to anaphylaxis can occur through an IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated response. The pulmonary system, which includes the lungs and airways, can be affected during anaphylaxis. The gastrointestinal system can also be involved in anaphylaxis. The cardiovascular system plays a crucial role in anaphylaxis as well. The integumentary system, which includes the skin, is often affected during anaphylaxis. If left untreated or if treatment is delayed, anaphylaxis has the potential to progress rapidly and become life-threatening. It is important for individuals experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis to seek immediate medical attention. Prompt administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) via autoinjector devices like EpiPen is typically recommended as first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Overall, understanding the different systems involved in anaphylaxis helps healthcare professionals recognize its severity and take appropriate measures to prevent life-threatening complications. It is important to note that the severity of symptoms can vary. During anaphylaxis, the airways can swell, leading to severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In some cases, anaphylaxis can cause cardiovascular collapse, coma, or even death if not treated promptly. Therefore, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if experiencing symptoms of an allergic reaction, especially if they are severe or if anaphylaxis is suspected. Timely administration of appropriate treatment, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and antihistamines, can help prevent life-threatening complications and improve outcomes. case definition and guidelines for anaphylaxis are available on their website. Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness, and a drop in blood pressure. is a very rare allergic reaction (one in a million vaccinees), unexpected, and can be fatal if not dealt with adequately. and can include mild-to-severe anaphylaxis or anaphylactic-like responses (e.g. This condition can be caused by an allergy (e.g., food, vaccine, drugs), stress, infection, or physical agents (e.g., heat, cold). Reports of anaphylaxis are less common in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries, probably because of reduced surveillance sensitivity and as the event may not be recognized (i.e. Anaphylaxis of unknown cause and unrelated to vaccines increases during adolescence, being more common among girls. Vaccinators should be able to distinguish anaphylaxis from fainting and vasovagal syncope Vasovagal syncopeA neurovascular reaction that leads to fainting. and failure to recognize and treat other serious medical conditions). But this very potent agent can cause irregular heartbeat, heart failure, severe hypertension HypertensionHigh blood pressure. Each vaccinator who is trained in the treatment of anaphylaxis should have rapid access to an emergency kit with adrenaline, and be familiar with its dosage and administration.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

In the case of an infant whose bowel is left in discontinuity, the surgical creation of a mucous fistula or connection to the distal bowel may be helpful, as this allows for refeeding of ostomy output to the distal bowel. Currently, its use is limited to emergency surgery when immediate anastomosis is not possible, or more rarely it is used palliatively in patients \n\n Self-locking loops are used for closure of the sternum after open chest surgery and at repair of rib fractures in foals. Within research, there are self-locking loops, based on the construction of the traditional cable tie, designed for surgery. The device is intended for ligation purposes; by compressing tissue hemorrhage is prevented. In urology, short term use of cable ties have been described at partial kidney resection. The Hartmann's procedure with a proximal end colostomy or ileostomy is the most common operation carried out by general surgeons for management of malignant obstruction of the distal colon. The indications for this procedure include: Use of the Hartmann's procedure initially had a mortality rate of 8.8%. Currently, the overall mortality rate is lower but varies greatly depending on indication for surgery.

It may result in horizontal diplopia or double vision, where the patient sees two images side by side. This is because the misalignment of the eyes causes each eye to receive a different visual input. In this case, the eye affected by the fourth nerve palsy may intort or rotate inward on attempted downward gaze. A compensatory head tilt to the opposite shoulder, known as Bielschowsky sign, is a characteristic feature of fourth-nerve lesions. This maneuver causes intorsion of the unaffected eye and helps alleviate the double vision. In this scenario, the patient may tilt their head toward the side of the lesion to ameliorate the diplopia. Bilateral trochlear palsies, often seen after head trauma, can present with alternating hyperdeviation depending on the direction of gaze. In summary, lesions affecting the sixth nerve can lead to lateral gaze palsy, while lesions of the superior oblique muscle and trochlear nucleus can result in downward gaze palsy. These conditions can cause symptoms such as diplopia (double vision) and specific eye deviations. Patients tend to have difficulty looking down (a downgaze palsy) followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy. This vertical gaze paresis will correct when the examiner passively rolls the patient's head up and down as part of a test for the oculocephalic reflex. On close inspection, eye movements called \"square-wave jerks\" may be visible when the patient fixes at distance. These are fine movements, that can be mistaken for nystagmus, except that they are saccadic in nature, with no smooth phase. Although healthy individuals also make square-wave jerk movements, PSP patients make slower \n\nDiplopia and cranial palsy are complex conditions resulting in vision dysfunctions such as double vision (diplopia). Diplopia and cranial palsy comprise one of the most sweeping differential diagnoses in all of ophthalmology eye care. Diplopia occurs when the eyes are not moving together so that the brain is getting two slightly different pictures simultaneously. Rarely, MS patients may develop double vision from a sixth nerve palsy or other neuro-ophthalmologic disorder. Sometimes the patient does not see two completely separate images. An important question to ask is whether the visual problem goes away if either eye is closed. Because diplopia is caused by the brain receiving two different images, one from each eye, as soon as eithereye is closed, this type of visual problem will go away. On examination, there may be an obvious problem with the movement of the eyes, but sometimes the misalignment is not easy to see without special equipment. This occurs when the images produced by the two eyes do not absolutely match, so that the images produced are misaligned relative to one another. The diplopia disappears when one eye is covered. It affects one eye only and continues when the unaffected eye is covered. Abducens (also called sixth) nerve palsy is the most common in MS and affects the nerve which operates lateral rectus muscle which pulls the eye outwards. Oculomotor (also called third) nerve palsy is much rarer than abducnes in MS and it’s not really understood why. Forth nerve palsy is often associated with vertical diplopia. A related paralysis, called internuclear ophthalmoplegia, sometimes, but not always, leads to double vision. It is due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle, which is also commonly affected by MS.\nDiplopia often resolves on its own in six to 8 weeks time. The eye patch is guaranteed to “cure” the diplopia, since only one eye will be sending an image to the brain, but some patients may feel self-conscious while wearing the patch. Prism eyeglasses are similar to prescription eyeglasses for reading. In rare cases, strabismus surgery (surgery to correct crossed eye) may be recommended to realign the eyes. For some people, wearing a patch over one eye or frosted tape over one lens of their glasses helps block visual input from one eye, thereby achieving single vision until the exacerbation is over. There is no danger in developing a “lazy eye” from patching. If patching is not effective, prism lenses may be incorporated into eyeglasses to redirect the way light enters the eye. Over time, the eye muscles learn to fuse the images into one. When patching and prisms don’t work, doctors may prescribe steroids. Only moving objects in the scotoma are\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Conversely, over more prolonged exercise of lower intensities sodium bicarbonate does not seem to have any effect on performance. Buffers such as sodium bicarbonate and citrate (see below) will increase the buffering capacity by increasing the amount of bicarbonate (for example) that can be utilised, say by increasing pH to 7.5. In this instance, sodium bicarbonate and citrate are acting as extracellular buffers of hydrogen ions. During high-intensity exercise hydrogen ions are produced, seemingly as a by-product of high rates of glycolysis. Ingesting sodium bicarbonate has been shown to increase blood bicarbonate concentration, thereby increasing the buffering capacity of the blood. This increase in blood bicarbonate increases the hydrogen ion gradient between the blood and within the muscle cell. This will also lead to an increase in lactate removal from the muscle and an increase in plasma lactate concentration, often seen with sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Ingestion of sodium bicarbonate can lead to quicker recovery in acid–base balance after exercise. This may be significant for events where there is multiple events or rounds in one day.Some research suggests that doses as low as 200 mg/kg will lead to an increase in blood buffer capacity.A longer-term loading protocol of 500 mg/kg per day spread over the day or chronically for 2–3 days may provide a more sustained increase in blood pH, with benefits maintained for at least 1 day following the last sodium bicarbonate dose. A marathon runner's velocity at lactate threshold is strongly correlated to their performance. In endurance trained athletes, the increase in blood lactate concentration appears at about 75%-90%VO2Max, which directly corresponds to the VO2Max marathoner's run at. To maintain muscle pH and delay fatigue, H+ ions and lactate anions (La-) are transported via monocarboxylate transporters to the extracellular spaces. Supplementation with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7 2H2O) can increase the blood's buffering capacity, inducing metabolic alkalosis and improving the rate of H+ efflux from active skeletal muscle. However, studies on whether sodium bicarbonate supplementation significantly delays fatigue and improves performance have yielded mixed results. Therefore, further research is needed to establish the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate supplementation in enhancing exercise performance and delaying fatigue.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

Some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings, while others have a mix of both. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, spasticity, muscle spasm, and abnormal reflexes. Pure upper motor neuron diseases, or those with just UMN findings, include PLS. Pure lower motor neuron diseases, or those with just LMN findings, include PMA. Motor neuron diseases with both UMN and LMN findings include both familial and sporadic ALS. The main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions can be distinguished from lower motor neuron lesions based on specific characteristics. Upper motor neuron lesions typically result in spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and clonus, while lower motor neuron lesions are associated with weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. Another characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions is hyperreflexia, which refers to an exaggerated response of deep tendon reflexes. The presence of the Babinski sign is also indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. In individuals with upper motor neuron lesions, this reflex is abnormal, with the toes extending rather than flexing. On the other hand, lower motor neuron lesions primarily manifest as weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. In summary, the main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions include spasticity, hyperreflexia, the Babinski sign, and clonus. In contrast, lower motor neuron lesions are characterized by weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. Understanding these distinctions can aid in diagnosing and differentiating between various neurological conditions affecting the motor system. Upper motor neuron paralysis refers to an injury or lesion that occurs in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in damage to the upper motor neurons. On the other hand, lower motor neuron paralysis refers to damage or injury to the lower motor neurons that are located in the spinal cord or brainstem and connect to the muscles directly. The main difference between upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis lies in the location of the damage or injury. Upper motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the upper motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord, while lower motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the lower motor neurons located in the spinal cord or brainstem. Additionally, muscle weakness, though present, may not be as severe as in lower motor neuron paralysis. Both upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis can result in significant motor impairment and loss of function. After an upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion, there are distinct clinical deficits that can be observed, particularly in relation to muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. In lower motor neuron lesions, the loss of lower motor neurons leads to several changes in muscle function. Furthermore, deep tendon reflexes are decreased in lower motor neuron lesions, a condition known as hyporeflexia. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with different clinical deficits. In the early stages of upper motor neuron lesions, the muscles initially display hypotonia and hyporeflexia, similar to lower motor neuron lesions. However, over time, the muscles affected by upper motor neuron lesions develop increased tone (hypertonia) and deep tendon reflexes become exaggerated (hyperreflexia), a condition known as spasticity. One specific marker of an upper motor neuron lesion is the presence of the Babinski sign. It's worth noting that in a normal child who has not yet begun walking, a positive Babinski sign can be observed since the upper motor neurons have not yet functionally modified lower motor neuron activity. To summarize, the clinical deficits observed after an upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion differ in terms of muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. Lower motor neuron lesions are characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, hypotonia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with muscle weakness, hypertonia, increased deep tendon reflexes, and the development of spasticity. The presence of the Babinski sign can also be indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. Upper motor neuron lesions typically present with spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski's sign. Both types of lesions result in weakness. During testing, look for signs of spasticity (indicative of upper motor neuron lesions) such as stiffness or increased resistance during movement.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

This causes a higher anaerobic to aerobic energy ratio during a marathon. Uncertainty exists about how lactate threshold effects endurance performance. Contribution of blood lactate levels accumulating is attributed to potential skeletal muscle hypoxemia but also to the production of more glucose that can be used as energy. The inability to establish a singular set of physiological contributions to blood lactate accumulation's effect on the exercising individual creates a correlative role for lactate threshold in marathon performance as opposed to a causal role. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the citric acid cycle, which ultimately generates ATP through oxygen-dependent oxidative phosphorylation. When oxygen \n\nDuring vigorous exercise, the lactate concentration can reach 30mM or higher and pH can decrease to ~6.5 (Fitts, 1994).Anaerobic glycogenolysis results in the accumulation of lactate ions which are accompanied by H+.This forces pyruvate to be reduced to lactate, and only three ATP are then formed from each glycosyl residue.may no longer be present at sufficient concentrations, which can have a large impact on the results. ### CHANGES IN METABOLISM DURING FATIGUE\n\nEnergy consumption in skeletal muscle fibres increases dramatically during high-intensity exercise. A large fraction of the ATP consumed is then produced by anaerobic metabolism, which includes lactate formation and breakdown of PCr. Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in skeletal muscle, and when energy is required the enzyme phosphorylase catalyses the sequential removal of glycosyl residues from the glycogen molecule. During intense exercise, the rate of pyruvate formation by glycogen breakdown exceeds the rate of its oxidation by the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria; at the same time the formation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH) exceeds the rate at which it can be oxidised by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This forces pyruvate to be reduced to lactate, and only three ATP are then formed from each glycosyl residue. Anaerobic glycogenolysis results in the accumulation of lactate ions which are accompanied by H+. During vigorous exercise, the lactate concentration can reach 30mM or higher and pH can decrease to ~6.5 (Fitts, 1994).There is a correlation between glycogen depletion and exhaustion (Bergström _et al.,_ 1967), but the exact mechanism(s) by which this occurs is not fully understood.Contracting skeletal muscle cells can consume ATP, producing ADP and Pi, much faster than it is regenerated.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil. Based on the symptoms described, the possible diagnosis for a patient presenting with complaints of diplopia, dilated pupils, and loss of both direct and consensual light reflexes is a 3rd nerve palsy. A 3rd nerve palsy occurs when there is damage or dysfunction to the third cranial nerve, leading to a variety of symptoms such as double vision (diplopia), dilated pupils (mydriasis), and loss of both direct and consensual light reflexes. It is essential for a healthcare professional to conduct a thorough physical examination, including a detailed medical history and a complete eye examination, to determine the exact cause of the 3rd nerve palsy and to guide appropriate management. Please note that while 3rd nerve palsy is a common diagnosis for the given symptoms, for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is important for the patient to consult their healthcare provider. an intact efferent path, and an intact consensual pupillary reflex). It is also common in retrobulbar optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis but only for 3–4 weeks, until the visual acuity begins to improve in 1–2 weeks and may return to normal. A total CN II lesion, in which the affected eye perceives no light, is very similar to a Marcus Gunn pupil; to distinguish them, in a CNII total lesion shining the light in the affected eye produces zero dilation nor constriction. If there is an efferent defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally. If there is an afferent defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is \n\n The Marcus Gunn pupil is a relative afferent pupillary defect indicating a decreased pupillary response to light in the affected eye. When the test is performed in an eye with an afferent pupillary defect, light directed in the affected eye will cause only mild constriction of both pupils (due to decreased response to light from the afferent defect), while light in the unaffected eye will cause a normal constriction of both pupils (due\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

This procedure helps determine if the patient has underlying thyroid cancer. In the case of a suppressed TSH, a thyroid scan and radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan are the appropriate diagnostic tests to perform. If a nodule is identified as \"hot\" or hyper-functioning, it is less likely to be malignant. On the other hand, a \"cold\" or hypo-functioning nodule may warrant further investigation. In some cases, a thyroid scan and RAIU scan may be necessary to gather additional information. With the standard overactive thyroid, iodine uptake into the thyroid is avid, whereas if the cells are damaged, then uptake is poor. In this way, if there is doubt about whether the patient has too much thyroid hormone because of de Quervain's thyroiditis, then measuring radio-iodine uptake or technetium uptake gives a clear cut answer as it will be higher than normal in standard thyrotoxicosis and lower than normal in de Quervain's. Graves' disease due to negative feedback from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound iodine (elevated). Biopsy to obtain histiological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed. The goiter in Graves' disease is often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. Not all nodules need to be biopsied.Sometimes, a diagnosis cannot be made after an FNA, and the procedure must be repeated.Doing an FNA involves retrieving cells from the nodule, which are then studied closely for cancer.These include:\n\n  * **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA):** Aside from surgery, an FNA is the only way to determine whether a nodule is cancerous or not.Nodules accompanied by enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck may also indicate cancer. ## A Look at Toxic Adenomas\n\nOf all the different types of nodules, the ones that cause the most severe hyperthyroidism are the toxic adenomas, which develop as a result of an abnormality in the follicular cell of the thyroid. With toxic adenomas, a mutation causes the TSH receptor to be permanently turned on, even without TSH. # Evaluating Nodules\n\nSome nodules cause pain. In any case, if a nodule is detected in your thyroid gland, it's critical to get a thorough evaluation of the nature of the nodule and whether it's cancerous or not. These include:\n\n  * **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA):** Aside from surgery, an FNA is the only way to determine whether a nodule is cancerous or not. Not all nodules need to be biopsied.A nodule found incidentally (on an MRI or CT performed for something else) is more likely to be benign compared to one that is noticeable.Cysts usually do not require a biopsy unless they are large or growing.Ultrasound can often be used to help tell if a nodule looks benign and can be watched, or needs to be biopsied.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

Enlarged liver or hepatomegaly is not a disease but a sign of a disease. Number of liver diseases may affect children and result in enlargement of the liver. Hepatomegaly is usually caused by viral infections of the liver. Hepatomegaly may occur due to hepatoblastoma, which is a type of the liver cancer mainly seen in newborns. Other causes of hepatomegaly can be heart diseases, obesity, metabolic disorders, vitamins A and D toxicity and prolonged use of certain medications. When enlargement of the spleen follows enlargement of the liver, it is a condition known as hepatosplenomegaly. When the liver in children is slightly enlarged, it may cause no signs and symptoms. But as the condition progresses and the liver continues to expand, affected child may experience abdominal pain. The liver may be tender to touch as well. Hepatomegaly can be identified by X-ray examination, ultrasound scan, CT scan and blood tests. In mild cases, children are prescribed drugs for treatment of the liver inflammation. In a small proportion of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively. Hepatic encephalopathy may also occur after the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex, and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol. In this condition, moderate congestion can cause right upper quadrant discomfort and tender hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). This condition is typically associated with chronic liver damage, often due to alcohol abuse, chronic viral hepatitis, or other liver diseases. It's important to note that an enlarged liver is often asymptomatic, meaning that a person may not experience any noticeable symptoms. They will be able to perform a physical examination and order appropriate tests, such as blood tests, imaging studies, and liver biopsies, if necessary, to determine the underlying cause of the enlargement and guide appropriate treatment. This large, atypical hemangioma of the liver may present with abdominal pain or fullness due to hemorrhage, thrombosis or mass effect. Further complications are Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, a form of consumptive coagulopathy due to thrombocytopaenia, and rupture.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.
