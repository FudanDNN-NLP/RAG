In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. It is increasingly acknowledged in urban anthropology that, although there are significant differences in the characteristics and forms of \n\n in which urban resistance is a key image; the gendered city, dominant in urbanizing areas such as Africa where women find themselves newly employed in low-wage labor; postmodern city, that is centered on capitalism; and fortress city, where different populations within the city are separated, usually based on socioeconomic factors.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels.

Working-class Americans \n\n In the first decades of the 20th century there was a change in education for middle-class girls. Previously it had been common for girls to be educated by a private tutor, an approach which led to young women growing up with a feeling of isolation from their peers.

Electronic monitoring or electronic incarceration (e-carceration) is state use of digital technology to monitor, track and constrain an individual's movements outside of a prison, jail or detention center. Common examples of electronic monitoring of individuals under pre-trial or immigrant detention, house arrest, on probation or parole include: GPS wrist and ankle monitors, cellphones with biometric security systems, ignition interlock devices and automated probation check-in centers or kiosks. The use of electronic monitoring has increased considerably in recent years in the United States. **Proponents of the use of electronic monitors to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue the devices: < 1) are more cost-effective for states that can ill afford the high price of brick and mortar prisons and jails. 6) punish offenders without being too harsh 7) improve the lives of individuals who might otherwise languish in prison or jail **Opponents of the use of technology to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue \n\n and replace bail with shackles as pre-trial detainees consent to electronic monitoring in order to be released from jail.

Gemeinschaft relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. Max Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Geert Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: gemeinschaft (usually translated as \"community\") and gesellschaft (\"society\" or \"association\"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a \"unity of will\". Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\"). \"[Sociology is] ... the \n\n a whole; distress of Third-World countries; poverty on a national/international level; and environmental deprivation, whereas microsociology analyses issues such as the individual features of war (e.g. While there are differences between each, including whether their adherents personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\", each still classifies as anti-authoritarian socialism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

One factor contributing to the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was the cutbacks in income transfers during the Reagan years. These cutbacks helped increase both poverty and inequality. However, changes in tax policy did have some impact on reducing poverty and increasing inequality. It's important to note that the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was not solely due to policy choices during the Reagan Administration. There were broader social and economic factors at play, such as widening income differences and challenges faced by families in staying out of poverty. Overall, while the standard of living improved to some extent during the Reagan years, there were persistent issues of income inequality and poverty that were not adequately addressed by the policy measures undertaken. Causes of income inequality in the United States describes the reasons for the unequal distribution of income in the US and the factors that cause it to change over time. Income inequality in the United States grew significantly beginning in the early 1970s,  after several decades of stability. The US consistently exhibits higher rates of income inequality than most developed nations, arguably due to the nation's relatively less regulated markets. Additionally, the 1996 welfare reform bill, which required states to reduce welfare numbers, may have provided an incentive for states to reclassify poor individuals as disabled to improve their welfare statistics. Nor does the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for more skilled workers seem to be generally associated with a divergence in household income among the population. Inventions of the 20th century such as AC electric power, the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with greater inequality. Another explanation is that the combination of the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers, and the failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient \n\n Employment discrimination is also closely linked to education and skills. One of the most important factors that can help describe employment disparities was that for much of the post-WWII-era, many Western countries began shedding the manufacturing jobs that provided relatively high-wage jobs to people with moderate to low job skills. This had an unbalanced effect of decreasing employment opportunities for the least educated in the labor force while at the same time increasing the productivity and therefore wages of the skilled labor force, increasing the level of inequality. Namely, the union movement began to shrink, decreasing the power for employees to negotiate employment terms, and the minimum wage was prevented from increasing alongside inflation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Mintzberg and Drucker studied how executives spent their time, Meadows how change and leverage to resist it existed at all levels in all kinds of organizations. Adhocracy, functional leadership models and reengineering were all attempts to detect and remove administrative incompetence. Had managers been more accountable to employees, it is argued, owners and employees would not have been defrauded. In management literature today, the term \"scientific management\" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples (\"classical\", implying \"no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value\") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. When all businesses were small, almost all were managed by the proprietor. Management and business leadership as a profession arose during the industrial revolution with the advent of businesses much too large to be managed by a single entrepreneur. With this profession a formal interest developed in labor relations, motivation of a work force, and efficiency in production. Frederick Winslow Taylor developed the scientific theory of management which he published in the journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1895.

According to Marxist feminists, women's liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women's labor is uncompensated. Marxist feminists extend traditional Marxist analysis by applying it to unpaid domestic labor and sex relations. Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that private property, which gives rise to economic inequality as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression. According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations—that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as wage work in order to support their position. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Another example is schizophrenia, the risk for which may be considerably reduced in a healthy family environment (Tienari et al., 2004). Reasons cited for this controversy include the subjectivity of diagnosis, the use of diagnosis and treatment for social and political control including detaining citizens and treating them without consent, and the side effects of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics and historical procedures like lobotomy and other forms of psychosurgery or insulin shock therapy. There are a number of groups who are either critical towards psychiatry or entirely hostile to the field. The Critical Psychiatry Network is a group of psychiatrists who are critical of psychiatry; there are self-described psychiatric survivor groups such MindFreedom International, religious groups like Scientologists. Background \n\nSince the 1960s there have been challenges to the concept of mental illness. Sociologists Erving Goffman and Thomas Scheff said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; behavioural psychologists challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; gay rights activists criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Since the social enlightenment about homosexuality, it is no longer considered a mental illness and is more widely accepted by society. For many years, some psychiatrists (such as David Rosenhan, Peter Breggin, Paula Caplan, Thomas Szasz) and outside critics (such as Stuart A. Kirk) have \"been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality\". In 2013, Allen Frances said that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". The term medicalization entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of Irving Zola, Peter Conrad and Thomas Szasz, among others. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's \"The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance\", published in 1973 (hyperkinesis was the term then used to describe what we might now call ADHD). These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz, 1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \"psychotechnology\" (Chorover, 1973). Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the clinical, involving serious side effects worse than the original condition; the social, whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the structural, whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively \"medicalized\" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these natural processes. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. Examples of political abuse of the power, entrusted in physicians and particularly psychiatrists, are abundant in history and seen during the Nazi era and the Soviet rule when political dissenters were labeled as \"mentally ill\" and subjected to inhumane \"treatments.\" In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be systematic in the Soviet Union, and occasional in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the People's Republic of China and in Russia. Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of 'sluggish schizophrenia' in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. Nature of diagnosis\n\nArbitrariness \nPsychiatry has been criticized for its broad range of mental diseases and disorders. Which diagnoses exist are considered valid have changed over time depending on society's norms. Historic disorders that are no longer recognised include orthorexia nervosa, sexual addiction, parental alienation syndrome, pathological demand avoidance, Internet addiction disorder. Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. References\n\nCited texts\n\nPsychiatry is, and has historically been, viewed as controversial by those under its care, sociologists and psychiatrists themselves.

Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

This shift, along with the appeal the government's policies had for many middle class intellectuals, helped to change the culture of both parties, in Labour's case permanently. The third Labour government's policies attracted a large university-educated liberal contingent to Labour, transforming the party from its working class, trade union roots. The political values were based on a producer's ethic, that is the working class was the truly productive sector of society, and expressed a version of republicanism that was similar to the middle class version. This enabled the businessman's party, the Republican party, to enjoy a strong base among Protestant blue collar workers, and prevented the emergence of a strong Socialist movement. According to Eric Hobsbawm, the term was coined by Engels in an 1885 introduction to The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, but it described a phenomenon which was already a familiar topic in English socio-political debate. This evidently described by Sociologist M. Lipset during the latter half of the 20th century were liberal democratic working class advocated for their party to represent their problems In the 1950s but quickly diminished during the 1970s as class relations in political partnership was dissolving. This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain's politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community. For most of American history, social class barriers were fundamentally rigid, with various private and public institutions enforcing rules based on racial segregation and other forms of classifying people based on prejudices such as antisemitism and Hispanophobia.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Furthermore, individual core self-evaluation traits like emotional stability have been linked to job performance in team settings (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1995 as cited in ). According to a study on mass-retail employees, proactive personality emerged as a protective factor against conflicts with clients, especially among employees experiencing high levels of emotional dissonance. They actively take steps to manage their emotions and engage in adaptive strategies to handle emotional demands effectively. Emotional dissonance, which refers to the internal experience of mismatched emotions, was found to be associated with more hostile customer relations. Identifying resources that enable the management of emotional demands is crucial in developing suitable adaptive strategies for individuals in customer-facing roles. A study conducted among dual-earner couples found that engaging in surface acting at work can have ripple effects on employees' energetic resources and relationship satisfaction at home. According to the study, employees who engage in surface acting at work tend to experience work-related exhaustion. This exhaustion acts as a mediating factor, meaning it partially explains the relationship between surface acting at work and at home. In other words, surface acting at work can drain employees' energetic resources, leading to increased levels of exhaustion. Furthermore, the study also found that surface acting at home can impact both the individual and their partner's satisfaction with the relationship. This relationship satisfaction is influenced by the individual's emotional energy, which is reduced as a result of surface acting at home. Recognizing the potential impact on employees' energetic resources and relationship satisfaction, organizations can work towards creating a supportive and authentic work environment that acknowledges and addresses employees' emotional needs.

Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables:  Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries. It is the movement between different socio-economic stratas, which can be influenced by various factors such as education, occupation, income, and wealth. People with a higher level of social mobility have the opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status and experience upward mobility, while those with limited mobility may find it challenging to escape poverty or advance economically. A social movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular goal, typically a social or political one. It is a type of group action and may involve individuals, organizations or both.

Weber described four categories of \"Ideal Types\" of behavior: zweckrational (goal-rationality), wertrational (value-rationality), affektual (emotional-rationality) and traditional (custom, unconscious habit).

Weber introduced the personality charisma sense when he applied charisma to designate a form of authority. Weber himself wrote: \"An ideal type is formed by the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those onesidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified analytical construct...\" It is a useful tool for comparative sociology in analyzing social or economic phenomena, having advantages over a very general, abstract idea and a specific historical example.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Immediately after the American Civil War, the federal government launched a program known as Reconstruction which aimed to rebuild the states of the former Confederacy. The federal programs also provided aid to the former slaves and attempted to integrate them into society as citizens.

About 186,000 free blacks and newly freed slaves fought for the Union in the Army and Navy, thereby validating their claims to full citizenship.

Others fled or crowded into refugee camps operated by the Freedmen's Bureau. The Bureau provided food, housing, clothing, medical care, church services, some schooling, legal support, and arranged for labor contracts. The war undermined the institution of slavery.

Recent theories within cultural criminology take into account the role of space (such as urban space) in the construction of crime, positing, for example, that where an action takes place is as important as the effect of the action in determining criminality. motivated by these ideological justifications. They saw their crime as influential in the way that it might subvert moral codes enforced by an unjust system and participated in illegalism in hopes of generating tangible structural change. In this way, they were not as closely affiliated with the individualist milieu than other illegalists. Other illegalists, such as Jules Bonnot, were less concerned with the propagandist component of praxis, but rather saw the crime itself as the insurrection. In his differential association theory, Edwin Sutherland posited that criminals learn criminal and deviant behaviors and that deviance is not inherently a part of a particular individual's nature. When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure. He argues that criminal behavior is learned in the same way that all other behaviors are learned, meaning that the acquisition of criminal knowledge is not unique compared to the learning of other behaviors.
