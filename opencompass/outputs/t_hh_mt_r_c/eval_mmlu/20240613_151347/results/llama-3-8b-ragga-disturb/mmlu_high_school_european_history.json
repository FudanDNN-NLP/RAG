The following passage shows Schiller applying the same sort of reasoning to the evolution of consciousness: \"Taken as the type of the pseudo-metaphysical method, which explains the higher by the lower ... it does not explain the genesis of consciousness out of unconscious matter, because we cannot, or do not, attribute potential consciousness to matter. Regardless of their complexity, they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation\". Miller said that systems exist at eight \"nested\" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and \n\ningestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer The living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their structure, interaction, behavior and development. This work is created by James Grier Miller, which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his magnum opus Living Systems, a \"living system\" must contain each of twenty \"critical subsystems\", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In Living \n\nSmall organic molecules are much less abundant than the organic macromolecules, accounting for only about one-tenth of the total mass of organic matter in a cell.Many small molecules have more than one role in the cell—for example, acting both as a potential subunit for a macromolecule and as an energy source.Carbon is outstanding among all the elements in its ability to form large molecules; silicon is a poor second. Cells Contain four major families of small organic molecules\n\nThe small organic molecules of the cell are carbon-based compounds that have molecular weights in the range of 100–1000 and contain up to 30 or so carbon atoms. Small organic molecules are much less abundant than the organic macromolecules, accounting for only about one-tenth of the total mass of organic matter in a cell.All organic molecules are synthesized from and are broken down into the same set of simple compounds.As a consequence, the compounds in a cell are chemically related and most can be classified into a few distinct families.Broadly speaking, cells contain four major families of small organic molecules: the sugars, the fatty acids, the nucleotides, and the amino acids (Figure 2–6).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

However, Brown reminds us \"We should not underestimate the fierce mood of the Christians of the fourth century\", nor should it be forgotten that repression, persecution and martyrdom do not generally breed tolerance of those same persecutors. Rome had been removing anything it saw as a challenge to Roman identity since Bacchic associations were dissolved in 186 BCE. That military action against a mystical religion became the pattern for the Roman state's response to anything it saw as a religious threat. asserting that the emperor was a soldier of God, not simply a personal believer but one bound by his position to serve the faith; under no circumstances could he agree to something that would promote the worship of idols. Their unique success in war, conquest, and the formation of an Empire, was attributed to the empire maintaining good relations with the gods through proper reverence and worship practices. To do this more effectively, they ransacked pagan Latin writings, particularly those of Varro, for everything that could be regarded by Christian standards as repulsive and irreligious.\" These Christian sources have had great influence on perceptions of this period by creating an impression of overt and continuous conflict that has been assumed on an empire-wide scale. Archaeological evidence indicates that, outside of violent rhetoric, the decline of paganism away from the imperial court was relatively non-confrontational.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) proposes a \"maker intellect\" which enables thinking by making things intelligible, much like light allows seeing by making things visible. Muslim philosophers Al-Farabi (d. 951) and Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina, d. 1037) further develop this theory and call it the \"agent intellect\", which gives forms to matter and facilitates human knowledge. Avempace (also known as Ibn Bajja, d. 1138) proposed a theory of the intellect that was to influence Averroes's theory, but, according \n\n said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God\". During the Enlightenment, a period \"characterized by dramatic revolutions in science\" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged. During the Enlightenment, humanistic ideas resurfaced, this time further from religion and classical literature. Divinity was no longer dictating human morals, and humanistic values such tolerance and opposition to slavery started to take shape. Some thinkers rejected theism outright and various currents were formed; atheism, deism, and hostility to organized religion. Notably during the Enlightenment, Baruch Spinoza redefined God as signifying the totality of nature; Spinoza was accused of atheism but remained silent on the matter.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

The text of the song expresses the pan-German sentiments common to revolutionary republicans of the period, which were considered inflammatory and treasonous in the German-speaking principalities. The phrase über alles at that time did not refer to militant ideas of conquest of foreign countries, but to the need for loyalty to a united Germany above regional loyalties. The best of Hoffmann von Fallersleben's poetical writings is his Gedichte (\"Poems\", 1827), but there \n\n outrage, the case of the sinking of the Lusitania, atrocity stories reported on German Army troops which were reported killing and maiming of innocent civilians and captured soldiers, faked photographs, the doctoring of official documents, and the \"hypocritical\" indignation.

A relatively early critic was Friedrich Nietzsche, who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza (\"Deutschland über alles\") \"die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt\" (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said, \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles – I fear that was the end of German philosophy.\" The pacifist Kurt Tucholsky was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book sarcastically titled Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, criticising right-wing groups in Germany. Pétain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his Révolution nationale necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as Pétain claimed, making the Révolution nationale unnecessary).

This concerns his doctors who plan to adjust his antibiotic regimen. Amphotericin is an anti-fungal medicine, of which I remember nothing from medical school except it's nickname, ampho-terrible, named due to it's uncomfortable side effects. There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. He has a separate rash all over his chest, where we weren't able to clean as well (due to his Hickman catheter) when he was getting his four-times-a-day baths for the thiotepa. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. We changed his bed sheets as he's been sleeping without a diaper because of a chemotherapy induced rash from contact with it. We may need to increase his pain medicine in order for him to tolerate it. As he calmed down he said, \"I don't feel very good.\" He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. We're dealing with, in no particular order: a fever, mucositis which causes him to drool instead of swallow, some intermittent nausea, and a whopper of a rash. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. Henry misses Anna and Sophie, so we added these to their room so that we can talk to them during the day. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! He's liberated in every sense of the word. He and Sophie immediately started playing, and within minutes they were running around the room screaming and jumping as a remote control Tow-mater chased them. Henry then cut off various limbs of his family members, and finally decided to use the chainsaw to give some My Little Ponies a hair cut. It's a little hard for him after his sisters go home, but he really had a ball. I came down early to relive Tara's double shift and found Henry pleasant and ready for the day. He rode the bike out in the hallway and accompanied me to do laundry and down to get my lunch. We are allowed this freedom as he was unhooked at our request for a brief period of time today. As long as he's bathed and changed before we adventure out (and refrain from touching things) we can go where we please for now, despite our 'isolation'. His major disappointment for today was not being able to go into the playroom. He cried very sadly for a time. I was able to distract him and he accepted it for now. It's a good source of distraction and he's come to look forward to it. The full version of the game I think would have been a little overwhelming so we played with them all turned face up. We played for about an hour - he was very attentive. He had some down time in the afternoon and then engaged his nurse with some play about his workbench. She indulged him very enthusiastically. A big relief from what was expected. Today is considered Day Zero, or the day he gets his stem cells, that were harvested from him 3 months ago, put back into his body. On Wednesday of this week, Henry and I, for entertainment purposes, had our own private “Crazy Sock Day” that impressed our rounding team. On the one hand, everyone tells us that it’s just like hanging another bag of medication, which runs in uneventfully. Well, the runup to the tranplant was truly more exciting than the transplant. I don't find it offensive (some people do) but I'm not planning on suggesting an air freshener line with it. So now we wait for that to happen over the next two weeks. He woke happily and has spent all day in bed. They had done a stool culture and found something called VRE. To prevent passing it on to others however, he must now be put in ‘isolation’. There are special contact precautions that all the health care workers must take now when entering the room, they must all don gloves and gowns in addition to their masks. Henry cannot go into the hallway without being bathed and his clothes changed. He is no longer allowed in the playroom, which is the biggest downside for him. Apparently this condition takes a while to resolve, particularly while resident in the hospital. His eyes lit up and he said, \"I want that choo choo crain\". Sometime during the first game, a child about Henry's age won and picked that train. There was consolation, the prize cart comes around for all participants after the games are over, so no one really gets left out, but try explaining that to Henry. Each time, she would say something like 'pass the phone' and Henry thought it was his newly chosen prize being taken again. There were only two winners left to be awarded. They called 'G - Bottle' and that did it for us. He was very proud of his prize and showed all the nurses that came in and promised to call them on it. He seems very comfortable, and in good spirits, but very tired. He ate 3 cookies for lunch but after that didn't drink or eat anything more. We've also been warned that next week will be the week that he feels the worst, so we'll continue to take one day at a time and hope that he feels as good tomorrow as he did today. He tires quickly and seems moments from dropping off to sleep at all times. After all, this is his life and his struggle. He's being forged into such a champion each day. Somehow, perhaps for the better, the time leading up to this round of chemotherapy kept me blissfully ignorant of what was to come. I fell very easily into the rhythm of our new home life and had put behind me the first phase of chemotherapy as difficult but over. This reflection was tossed among the daily rituals that have become normalized in our new view of reality. I felt like I'd come to a calm acceptance of day to day living within our new situation and withheld looking too far into the future for fear of becoming too attached to a positive outcome or too overwhelmed by a negative one. The several days immediately preceding Henry's most recent admission, began to weigh heavier and heavier upon me, a sense of dread mounting with each out patient visit to have him tested for his current functions so we could recognize what the chemotherapy had done to him. At some point during this time, I began to see the chemotherapy, not as medicine, but poison. We were planning to poison my son, because nothing else had any chance of preserving his life. The effects of this poison were to leave him, and those around him for that matter, scarred for life. Hopefully these scars would be minimal - small crosses to bear, the likes of which affect some at random anyhow - infertility or hearing loss for example. This knowledge and the pause before commencing the treatment, left me to stew on the possible outcomes, no longer able to preserve my shelter of ignorance. For the first time since Henry's diagnosis, I found myself angry at this situation. It wasn't a 'why us' kind of anger, but a frustrated, having-been-backed-into-a-corner kind of anger. There was nothing to do but accept it. No pleasure to be taken that would alleviate it. With full knowledge of it's effects, we would administer this poison to our son, hoping that it killed it's target before it ravaged him. I withdrew into myself, not really understanding my feelings well enough to talk about them to anyone. Several days passed while I attempted to work this out in my head. I exercised, meditated, ate better food, tried to relax; all attempts to calm myself about it. Nothing would change what was about to happen. It wasn't until I had my first turn in the hospital with him, seeing him doing well - laughing, playing and entertaining - that I was able to better accept our path. I woke up to a new level of realization and with it, a new wave of grief. Momentarily lifting my head out of my anxiety for our future, I found the effects of Henry's diagnosis rippling out to so many people, some very close and some at a distance. I realized that I've not been as attentive to those immediately around me - my daughters, what is this doing to them? I picture their sweet faces looking up at me with a sad, innocent and inquiring look, eyes welled with tears. I look at my wife and imagine us on our wedding day, never guessing what could lie ahead, wishing to avoid things like this. I see our parents being supportive but looking behind their eyes - I see their empathy for us and their own plight of having a grandchild with cancer, wanting so desperately to help or fix things and not being able to; our relatives, watching and being supportive where possible, going about their normal days only to be reminded suddenly of what's going on at odd moments throughout the day; circles of friends feeling helpless but offering such wonderful support despite it all; parents of our children's friends trying to give answers to their kids - knowing that no kid should have to worry about such things; barely beginning to appreciate the years and years of treatments those families we see in the clinic have endured and are to yet endure; watching kids during chemotherapy and seeing them colorful and playful one minute and ashen and sickly the next. There are days I feel completely inadequate to handle what's been handed us. Other days I feel capable, but wary because I know it's simply a function of time before that changes. In lieu of describing this whirlwind of emotions, my answers are brief and guarded when others ask how we're doing. I'm not sure I could describe it anyway, my emotions change at such blinding speed. When people marvel at how we're 'doing it all', I have to think, 'if you only knew'. Yes, there are opportunities for growth in all of this. Adversity does that. But it's difficult to take solace in that. It's a difficult pill to swallow that one's growth is coming at such an expense. But what are we to do? In the face of such a crisis, we pick ourselves up, arming ourselves with the comfort and support of family and friends and make the effort to take one step, one day, one moment at a time. He's been active and aside from not eating much and baths at odd hours of the day, it's not much different than being at home for him. He was, unbelievably, quite eager to come. His fan club of adoring nurses was waiting for him to arrive. Fortunately, they've recently learned ways to prevent this uncomfortable side effect. Due to the immune suppression that he'll have, there are some nursing (and therefore parenting) issues that will be new to us this time. The degree of discomfort varies from patient to patient. It sounds like he handled the first three cycles better than a lot of kids do, so we're hopeful we'll continue to have the same luck. It's what they told us to expect, but with the insurance as the critical dependency, I was kind of hoping for one more weekend. Anna teared up a bit - it gets to her when we're not here consistently and despite being 'annoyed' at him, she misses Henry when he's away. I have this strange conflicting irritation with the kids' minute-by-minute demands whenever we are expecting the hospital. I get frustrated with myself for it, because I feel I should be more patient and appreciative of them at such a time. It's so tumultuous the swirls of emotion rushing around in my head. \"That's OK - I'm used to it.\" Lately Tara and have had the uncomfortable feeling of having received good news regarding Henry's MRI, but having a sense of unease and foreboding. We've presumed it's been because since Henry's diagnosis, we've looked no further than the MRI to prevent our imaginations from running amok with the possible outcomes. Henry has become a pro at these. Having a child with cancer alters your dreams. It changes your perceptions of the world, the people you interact with and the long-held beliefs about everything from what one should expect from everyday life to the metaphysical questions of why we're here. When you laugh, you wonder if you're really allowed. Today we were given a glimpse of the road ahead and there are significant mountains to climb, the descent from which only a few make. Left alone, chances are extremely high that the cancer would return. Near term, Henry will likely face the loss of a significant enough portion of his hearing that he will require a hearing aid. One of the drugs used has already shown Henry's susceptibility to it and we will need to use a much higher dose to have the best chance at eradicating his cancer, but only for one cycle as its planned now. Whereas in the first three cycles, his system had its nadir for approximately 4 days, during this treatment, his system will be compromised for much longer during which he'll stay in the hospital as the risk of leaving is too high. We cannot hope for a better reading that that of late, the best result for Henry's type the transplant doctor said he's seen. So then, we wait. I'm sure it won't be without its obstacles - some of which we've already climbed or skated past. Neither seemed too pleased to meet one another as the wind was howling and there was no predicting which would have the better of the day. It turned out to be sufficient for much of the time to hang out in the provided housing. Being removed from our home environment for a while, without all the usual distractions seemed welcome by everyone. We ended up forced to look at each other with little to do and we enjoyed it! The first night we were once again treated by the kindness of strangers. Some with toys, money for gas, and others with messages of hope. As much practice at accepting these as I think I've had, it's always a surprise and I never really know what to say, beside the obvious 'Thank You'. I feel forever inadequate trying to convey our gratitude. When going to dinner at 'La Hacienda' that first evening we were treated so well and they made a point of wishing us the best. I'm forever amazed at the sources of our community of support. In the meantime we've been able to hide from it for a couple of days and are preparing to face it together. All that we had to do yesterday was get Henry's hearing test and a special treat that had been arranged for us. That special treat was a photo shoot done by Flashes of Hope, an organization that provides photography for children with cancer. I didn't really know what to think of it at first, but as with all things, I came to find out that the people doing this really had their hearts in it and once I saw some of the sample photos, I realized what a valuable gift this would be. He ate up all the attention they were giving him. There were clowns there to entertain those waiting and to draw smiles out of the children being photographed. Henry really pushed the clowns to their limits, \"Daddy, ask the clowns if they have any more cricks\". Apparently the drug can continue to affect hearing for up to 180 days after the treatment. The dosing to come is what is worrisome, but we'll deal with that as it comes. We keep reminding ourselves that Henry's type of medulloblastoma is anaplastic, a very aggressive subtype. All that it takes is one cancer cell to persist and we'll have major setbacks. Talk about a needle in a haystack. Seeing 'life-threatening' checked made me realize the kind of denial that we live in. It shouldn't have shocked me to see it, but it did. We arrived at the clinic before the receptionist and early enough that we got to feed the fish. Fortunately the anesthesiologist, whom we've had - and liked - before, offered to give his sedative in his stroller through his tubes of course. He awoke from these after about half an hour of rest and was very pleasant and didn't complain of any pain the rest of the day. The former is quick, the latter is long. After not eating all morning, Henry made up for it the rest of the day with pizza, chicken and gummy worms. A couple weekends ago, we had a relaxing, laze around the house kind of day, where despite all being cooped up inside we were laid back and didn't get on each others nerves. We attempted to interrupt the downward spiral with a trip to DC and the Air and Space Museum, but that was useful mostly for occupying the majority of the day and moving our family togetherness beyond the confines of the house. On Saturday we had some family friends over to visit as well as Tara's sister's family. In the afternoon we took a trip up to Mechanicsburg to spend some time with close friends and their twin girls, who are roughly Sophie's age. He's become very comfortable with the idea of these procedures as long as he's asleep for them. Tara said to me as she was talking to the oncologist on our trip home from Baltimore for Henry's MRI. The relief was palpable. The day itself was not so stressful, in fact Henry was a trooper - hardly complaining about not being able to eat all morning - but the weeks and months leading up to this moment, knowing it was coming, afraid for the results, yet hopeful, but wary...We'd prepared for lukewarm news. This quickly crystallized in my head to mean that the chemotherapy is working brilliantly. Other conclusions washed over me as we continued the drive home. Sheaves of worry lifted from my shoulders as I considered it all. We were braced for harsh reality and got handed another chance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

This discovery explains that the city had to be fortified further, which was done in the second half of the fourth century when the barbaric attackers began to really frighten Florence. This must have been the situation of the city when Ambrose, bishop of Milan, came to Florence in 393 and founded the basilica of San Lorenzo, outside the city gate ad aquilonem, but still protected in a certain way. At the time of Narsete, the various arts already met in guilds, called scholae, protected by a patron: this included the arts of blacksmiths, centonars, fulli, merchants, shopkeepers, stonemasons, potters, painters, etc.The forced increase of the population due to the migrations from Veneto led to a radical change in the economic production of the area, which from the periphery became a real market. However, the existence of such decadence has been disputed, because in 366 Florence was the capital of a vast province and united Tuscany and Umbria, due to the administrative reform by Diocletian and, until 315, it has been the seat of a bishop.

After being diagnosed with a chronic illness and going through feeling shock, sadness and anger, I settled in with the belief that since I was dealt this hand in life no other medical condition could come my way. I felt that there had to be some fairness. That was bad enough. Surely, that was enough for one person to deal with. One of my diagnoses was Sjogren’s Syndrome. This was something I had never heard of before. At that time the diagnosis was called “sicca” which means dryness of the mouth and eyes. I see my Dentist frequently and have three times per year teeth cleanings to prevent dental decay which can be caused by having a lack of saliva. I now have come to accept that I am indeed fortunate. There are many people seeking answers to their medical problems and not getting them. Through my blogs I’ve received inquiries from people who believe they have Sjogren’s but because they don’t have the antibodies in their blood, a positive lip biopsy or positive tests from their Ophthalmologist, they live with the diagnosis of sicca or connective tissue disorder, or no diagnosis. Following is some information to help you become your own advocate if you have the symptoms of Sjogren’s. Sjogren’s is often broken up into Primary or Secondary. Primary means that you have Sjogrens without any other connective tissue disorder. Secondary means that there is some other disorder present along with this syndrome. It is often more difficult to diagnose someone with Secondary Sjogren’s as they are more likely not to have the antibodies associated with Sjogren’s in their blood. That is because this is a syndrome in which all symptoms are not active at the same time and if the disease has progressed, the symptoms are similar to MS, CFS/MES and even Lupus. There are many tests that are used in diagnosing Sjogren’s. For dry mouth, do drink water but not too much, also rinse your mouth (don’t use mouthwash as the alcohol will further dry your mouth), brush your teeth after meals and use sugar free hard candy or gum. I also use Restasis which helps too. There are many other symptoms of Sjogren’s and they may require other specialists, tests and prescriptions. One important thing I’ve learned is not to self-diagnose yourself. Be your own advocate. There are many forms of support for people with Sjogren’s. Sandy has written a post about this previously. And knowing that I can help someone is one of the best ways to keep my mind off of my pity party. Sjogren’s Syndrome is getting recognized more frequently. One day this will be a disease that no longer exists. I work for that but for now I also work for creating a knowledge base and support for people who are seeking answers. She is a Disability Advocate who uses her blogs to break stereotypes for people with all types of disabilities and chronic illnesses, especially invisible chronic illnesses. Her blog, Brain Foggles is a personal journal of being a wife, parent, friend, church and community member who has days when all she can do is prop her eyes open and try to put some words together to sound coherent. My name is Sandra. Also I can hopefully offer some insight/support to others suffering from this condition as well as I hope to learn more here myself too! I also have a lot to share by the way of information, suggestions, from my own experiences and through my knowledge with Natural and Alternative treatments that can help people cope with their physical pain, as well as the emotional aspects of having this type of condition in a much healthier way than drugs. I’ve also had bouts with leg weakness going up stairs and burning painful knees, an inner vibrating sensation, skin sensitivity, dry throat/choking and occasional difficulty swallowing, and/or feeling bronchial congestion (like inflammation around lung area? ), uncomfortableness sore chest muscles, minor, occasional short-winded, dizzy (heart issues are ruled out) dry nose, headaches that seem to radiate from neck or in temples sometimes with pinching pain behind eyes etc, etc…bla, bla. I’m sure most of you understand and can relate. And if a person reading this, hasn’t experienced all these symptoms themselves I’m sure they’d think that I was a nut and/or hypochondriac! and regardless that I’m actually quite stable and a happy, upbeat person, I can tell you that this constant ailing and pain can drive anyone a bit crazy after a while. Just the worrying alone is indeed extremely, emotionally exhausting as well as the physical discomfort! Also…trying to “explain” to my spouse, family, friends why I just want to do NOTHING a lot of the time adds to the pressure. And that can cause feelings of isolation. However on a very positive (and (philosophical) note. Anyway…After 5 years of contemplating, researching online for matching symptoms, mystery diseases, and worrying myself “sicker” about what fatal disease I might have. After doing my own extensive research I became mostly concerned with diseases like Lupus or MS (which runs in my family) and/or Fibromialgia, Lymes Disease, etc, etc. But I didn’t really seriously consider it at the time because Sjorgren symptoms didn’t seem to match “all” of mine. Anyway…Being a person who always chooses the “Holistic” route, I was understandably reluctant to see a “Medical” doctor (since that has never work out well for me, nor will I take drugs). I finally agreed to see an Internist (a close friend of mine) hoping to get some kind of feed back from her about what I could possibly be suffering from. But I also discussed the other symptoms with her suggesting that they might all be related in some way. I also went for a specific type Spinal treatments for pain called Spinal Network Analysis (a form of mostly non to mild touch Chiropractic/Energy Healing work) which most definitely helped with pain and related muscle tension. The only Yoga I was able to continue was the “Restorative” classes. She was giving me an Intuitive” reading. She also said for me to be aware that I might not be taken seriously enough by the doctor and advised me to be very calm when /i saw her so that she would not dismiss me as being a “Hypochondriac”. I did follow her advice because although she didn’t feel that my condition was fatal she insisted that it was something that needed to be addressed. And as predicted by my insightful and gifted Psychic she certainly hadn’t taken me seriously at all! Its something systemic going on. Although it is possible that I might also have Fibro as a secondary condition, because of the many symptoms i have that match. Other further, targeted blood testing for RA and Sjorgren’s came back negative. So he has pretty much unofficially diagnosed me as having a mild case of Sjorgrens with a possible secondary condition as beginning stages of RA or severe Fibro?…Maybe its possible that its just RA in early stages and no Sjorgrens?…Or maybe it is “just” Sjorgrens alone but in any case I’m suffering most of the symptoms of these diseases and I must treat myself for them. And its highly possible that due to my healthy life style (which I will explain below) these conditions might not have progresses as fast as they would have. Nevertheless I’m determined to learn to live with it as best I can, whether its RA or Fibro (along with, or without the Sjorgrens). My next step is to have my Nutritionist re evaluate my tests results (she is also a Biochemist) and to explore every Natural Alternative treatment that is available to help me deal with my discomfort and pain and continue leading a very healthy lifestyle (Emotionally, Spiritually and Physically). You’d be surprised what a tremendous difference it makes and how much control you really do have regarding the “managing” of your illness and pain. I am absolutely positive that the healthy lifestyle I’ve chosen to live is what has allowed me to keep this condition from being worse than it could have been, had I not taken such good care of myself all these years. And/or if I had chosen the “Drug” and total Medical route to solve the problems of pain, emotional upset that my condition has caused me to suffer I might have had numerous other health problems and organ damage too. And who knows? Maybe I’ll even find a way on my own to reverse or improve my condition. In any case its empowering for me, knowing that I’m trying my very best to contribute to my wellness. Also I now know that there are many other people like myself who understand and we can all help support and inspire one another by sharing our experiences, knowledge and victories in managing our illness. Knowing that we can choose to do or not do certain things that keep us as healthy as possible is empowering…And making the best choices for ourselves is using and experiencing our Power! Going to “Extremes” either way never works long term. But there are some sensible steps everyone can take. I’m certainly not a “Fanatic” or someone who sacrifices all pleasures in life. And everyone’s system is different and unique. Its always beneficial to consult with a Nutritionist or professional to personalize a daily Health Regime and Diet to suit your particular needs and lifestyle. And those are the things and habits we can choose to avoid an our own. I hope that my sharing with you (below) many of the factors that I feel has helped me tremendously to keep my condition under control(avoid flare ups, manage pain, stay emotionally and spiritually healthy/balanced)and allow me to continue maintaining otherwise excellent “General Health will also help others in some way. FYI:Concerning my personal health regime and why I feel I’ve been able to remain in otherwise excellent health regardless of this painful condition. Though “all” of these choices (that I’ve made for my own life/health) might not work for everyone…I do believe that many of these “ideas” will resonate with “some”. Or even if just one person out there who is suffering, and/or feeling helpless is inspired its worth my taking this time to encourage you! I Don’t smoke,drink coffee/caffine, alcohol,(except for an occasional cocktail on a weekend or special occasions). I eat pretty much everything but I “try” to avoid dairy almost completely and soy products too. I eat pasta, bread or cookies and snacks made with brown rice and I stick to gluten free products and “Agave” or Stevia sweetened treats. Drugs don’t really heal they only mask pain/treat symptoms. I see a Chiropractor, Energy Healer, and even Massage even helps tremendously with pain and its soothing emotionally as well. The downside of course is that its very costly. I’m an struggling artist (songwriter/singer actress and writer/author)so, I have no health insurance at all either(for my medical check ups) either! But I have a wonderfully supportive significant other who I live with and helps support me financially. I sacrifice in other areas of my life (buying clothes, going on vacations etc, etc ) to be able to afford as many of these treatments as possible. I believe that we can all learn help our bodies heal itself if we take more responsibility for our own health and make good choices. Learning how to use these magnificent, innate healing gifts and trust them is our greatest advantage in helping us cope and manage our illness’s. and since most illness are manifestations of our experiences, beliefs, emotional and physical traumas etc, trying to keep our stress level down is also a very important aspect in staying physically healthy. Well…I hope that what or at least some of what I’ve written here has been of some help. I would like to make the progress you’ve made if only to lessen my symptoms until the possibility of being diagnosed with Sjogren’s. I am interested in more about what foods to avoid, which to eat-possibly together for maximum success. I am a desperate wife, my husband was diagnosed with sjogren’s about 6 months ago and since then I don’t know how to deal with him- there are times I feel he is exagerating but there are times his pain is genuine. he will not listen to my advice although I work in the medical feild and go to every doctors appointment with him and I really hear the doctors orders not like he does( what he wants to hear) I have asked several times and not gotten an answer to my question of whether a person with ss should drink alcohol or not–it seems he is worse after he does but he just won’t listen to me..someone please answer my question.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

She was Director of Student Health at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for sixteen years and served as the clinical administrator and medical consultant for an AIDS research project in conjunction with the Boston University School of Medicine and the Kushi Foundation. She is co-author, with Michio Kushi, of AIDS, Macrobiotics, and Natural Immunity (Japan Publications, 1990) and contributed to Doctors Look at Macrobiotics (Japan Publications, 1988). Dr. Cottrell, much in demand as a lecturer and teacher, shared some of her thoughts with MBT on women’s health, her style of medical practice, social attitudes on nurturing children, along with a few comments on the writings of George Ohsawa during the 1991 Fall Health Classic in Palm Springs, California. BL: I thought that we might explore several areas. Another is your background and evolution from a medical doctor to a preventive medicine/macrobiotic practitioner. And another is your method and style of treatment as a health care practitioner, plus anything else you would like to share. MC: That covers a lot of ground. Nature, in its infinite wisdom, requires that higher-order species have a long period of nurturing from infancy to maturity. The female does most of this nurturing. The whole structure in both the animal kingdom and particularly in our human species acknowledges the fact that the female needs to be protected as well as the young so that nurturing can take place until the next generation can get along on its own. But it’s the female that has the long gestational period and also has the long period for the nurturing and development of the human species. What I see happening in our society which concerns me so much is that women are so ill. We are seeing epidemic forms of disease among our women that have not been so prevalent before. What I’m seeing, from a wholistic perspective, is that we, as women, have left a place in society that was not working really, and now with the women’s movement, we’ve come to a place where we have many more options for self-realization. In so doing, we are destroying the opportunity for continuation of the species. Traditionally, the female has been the one that has received the fertilization, given birth, and nurtured the next generation. We are giving over this power that is female to technology. BL: How do you see that expressed in the patients that you see? As health practitioners, we have to help patients to understand the metaphor of their illness, the language of the illness, in order for them to heal. What I see is that the form of the illness can tell us, and the individual, a lot about the areas that need to be worked upon. BL: Why do people come to see you in particular? MC: Well, you have to realize that by virtue of who I am, I’m going to attract certain kinds of patients. Just the fact that I have a medical degree behind my name, provides people entrée to me. But also, at some level of their consciousness, they have chosen to come to me because they know that I’m operating on a level other than the physical. So whether they are conscious of it or not, they’ve chosen to come to me because they are available to look at the emotional and spiritual side, the wholistic. They have an awareness that many patients, who just get into the medical model and never get out, don’t have. My practice is very exciting and very stimulating. Most of the time it’s extremely rewarding because I can work with patients on many levels – on the physical, the spiritual, the nutritional, the environmental. Even if it’s not right at the surface, I just have to dig a little bit and soon I’m hitting paydirt. BL: Could you describe your method of treatment? What is it that you do in your practice? MC: I mostly facilitate. So it’s a real facilitating, sharing, exploration. BL: You no longer write prescriptions? Most of what I do in my practice is to facilitate the person in their search for the modality that’s most appropriate for their healing. What I’m available to do is to help them find their own answers. I ask patients to bring as much information as they can: their blood work, any kinds of reports, and I ask them to write out their health history. And it can vary from doing macrobiotic counseling, to helping them to decide whether they want to do chemotherapy or radiation therapy – or, if they are going to have surgery, what they are willing to accept or not accept. It’s a real exciting process, exploring options and encouraging them to use their own intuition to determine what the best choice would be for them at that particular time. BL: What led to your transition? I had a lot of experience before I even went to college. So, in medical school, I was much more mature in many ways than the other students. So just to sit there as a student and swallow anything hook, line, and sinker – that was not where it was at. And if you ask how, you can manipulate it. BL: What was your practice of medicine like when you first started? So I began to integrate more and more. Teenagers, unmanageable at home, would be brought in and I would say, “What’s going on at home and what’s going on at school?” And a lot of times, after talking a while, the mother would say, “Well, you know my mother’s living with us and I love my mother but she’s such a cantankerous old woman and she just butts into the kid’s business. She can’t tell them you can’t do this or that.” And I begin to see, mmm, the problem there is related. And patients would come in and say, “You know, Dr. Cottrell, I read this article in Prevention or I read this article in Ms., or somebody told me about this, and I’d like to know what you think about it.” So I’d say, “Well, let me read it and I’ll get back to you.” So I would read it. And I would say things like, “Well, I can’t see how this could hurt you and if it seems to be helping you, why not?” So I never made them feel like they were idiots or anything like that. Sometimes I would say to them, “I really think this is a racket. My patients had made me aware that there were other ways of doing things. So I began to search for alternatives. And it just so happened (you know it’s never an accident – when the student is ready, the teacher appears) that I met a very bright young family doctor right out of residency up in Seattle, Washington who was very wholistically oriented. I became aware of a lot of options and it was really fascinating for me. When I went to see Ilana, I said, “I’ve heard about your work and I’d really like to study with you. I’d like to learn your techniques so that I could help my patients.” That was my access point. So I said, “May I study with you? I want to be a better doctor.” She said, “I don’t know if I can teach you how to be a better doctor or how to take better care of your patients, but I can teach you how to take better care of yourself.” That went right over my head. I said, “Well, then are you saying that I can study with you?” I never got off my focus, see. I was down at the college [Fashion Institute of Technology] compulsively going through the mail and I threw out this little professional journal. I went through it and saw an advertisement for a position in a rural health initiative. So I took it home and I looked at where it was on the map and it looked like a fascinating area. I went down to Hyde County which is in North Carolina right on the coast, a very rural area. I finally got hold of some information. I continued to study with Ilana Rubenfeld. At that point, I began to go to Boston on a regular basis and study with Michio. BL: What convinced you that macrobiotic principles might be effective? Pure and simple. behind his name, macrobiotics has touched many Western minds. So I said to myself, “If this is true, if they knew this 6000 years ago, I want to know what else they knew 6000 years ago that we don’t know now.” So that’s what intrigued me. As I went on in my own research in the medical literature and studying macrobiotics, I was excited and amazed at how well they dovetailed, how supportive they were of each other. MC: Oh, most of what I use in my lectures comes from Western medical research. I just integrated it with macrobiotic thought. It was like, “I don’t want to do what I know how to do, and I don’t know how to do what I want to do.” So I quit. We had to expand rapidly to keep up with the growth of the college. So I sat down and presented to the administration my needs in order to keep up with the growth of the college. You see, I was able to manipulate my workplace so that it was balanced for me. And on the other hand, being the director, I had the opportunity to develop a program in health promotion. BL: You’ve talked a lot about prevention and educating children in your lectures. Could you describe your ideas about these areas? In other instances it means trying to be both the chairman of the board and a mother. How can we facilitate that so that a woman can take care of both her needs and the child’s needs and the family needs. The extended family has to be the workplace and school and society. In a way, it’s very exciting in that the extended family is going to have to be really extended if we’re going to have a healthy society. What we need to do is to look at the old patterns and update them. The same needs are there and the same solutions are there. They’re decked out in a different form, but the principles are there. And then there are other women who want to stay home and be housewives and mothers and care for their children. Politically, I think we have to redirect our economic resources toward providing either tax benefits or economic incentives to help replace a care giver’s earning ability, because that person is earning money. That person is putting a great deal into the society. Therefore society should pay their social security and pay their retirement and pay them a salary for staying home to care for the next generation. The care they give means that we will not have moneys going for crime, dropouts from school, or emotionally ill people that become homeless and a care on the society. So we have to really value those women who want to stay home and give them the economic rewards they are due. The way that women were treated in the past and even since the Second World War is that if you didn’t work in the workplace, you didn’t have any income, then you weren’t known to the government. On the other hand, if our women go to work and our children are being bounced around the way they’re bounced around, the children develop different kinds of problems – emotional problems. They’re socially handicapped. So we really do have to realize that providing nurturing environments is part of what we call prevention just as much as providing a health care clinic. Part of a national health program is to see that healthy homes produce healthy citizens who are productive and contribute to the economic health. Otherwise we’re going to end up with an increasingly heavy social debt that we can’t possibly keep up with. A premature baby costs something like $8000 or $10,000 a day to keep in a neonatal clinic. Even after that, 70 percent are severely handicapped and severely deformed. We’re going to have to provide custodial care for these people. We have to go back to the beginning and provide supportive and nurturing environments, beginning in school – we have to start there because there is no home. Our society basically is a conglomerate of dysfunctional families. The parents come home, they’re so tired they can’t even cook a meal, much less sit down and listen and know what’s going on with their children. The school has to be part of the extended family so that we can teach communication skills beginning from kindergarten or preschool. That has to begin very early because we know from recent studies that children who experience disruptive episodes before the age of three are at great risk of psychosis. Children who experience marked disruptive experiences before the age of six are at very great risk for neurosis. Daycare has to be more than a babysitting thing; it has to be a positive and stimulating experience. And women, if they work, need to have flexible hours so that they can breast feed and interrelate with their child, keep that connection. We need to give the opportunity to women, if they choose, to breast feed at least eighteen months to two years minimum. We have to adjust our workplace so that fathers can have time off because as children get older – as they detach – they need more time with their fathers. We have a lot of examples of what doesn’t work and we also have some examples of what can work. BL: What are your current projects? I would like very much to be involved with trying to create the opportunities I described for families and children. I’m trying to find the vehicle for that. I am also trying to create a lifestyle that will allow me to spend more time in the library studying and then from that reflecting, meditating, writing, and teaching. So my dream is that my so-called practice of medicine will be less and less and less. BL: You spoke of studying with Michio Kushi. I get a great deal from going back and studying Ohsawa. BL: Some people, particularly women in American/European culture, have a little difficulty with some of Ohsawa’s views. MC: You know, you have to understand the historical aspects of anything before you can understand why we are where we are. So for me to read and study Ohsawa helps me to understand better where we are now and gives me the perspective that will help me to know where we’re going to go in the future. I had some dynamic history teachers when I was in school. We talked about the social climate, the political climate, and the economic climate of this country. What generated it? What was the fertile ground for generating this disruption or this progress or whatever? And that’s what Ohsawa does for me, studying him really helps me understand a lot about what’s happening now in macrobiotics. week, each twenty-four yards long, and containing one hundred and five shoots of weft in an inch, the reed of the cloth being a forty-four, Bolton count, and the warp and weft forty hanks to the pound, A Steam Loom Weaver, fifteen years of age, will in the same time weave seven similar pieces.\" He then speculates about the wider economics of using power loom weavers: \"...it may very safely be said, that the work is done in a Steam Factory containing two hundred Looms, would, if done by hand Weavers, find employment and support for a population of more than two thousand persons.\" witnessed the extremes of poverty into which this Confiscation had thrown the Lathom family; he saw some of them with not the value of 5/- (25p) either in goods or lands, and constantly harried by religious and civil strife; and seeing all these things it is hardly surprising that he leaves money for the benefit of the poor – among whom the Lathoms of Parbold were now to be numbered; that he remembers the St. John Roman Catholic Mission in which Christopher Lathom, the priest and a possible relative, is interested; that he bequeaths £40 to the children of another possible relative, Mistress Katherine Lethem; that he forbids any public officer to be\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

It's an early work by Giovanni Gaggini of Bissone, who went on to earn great fame for similar works in Genoa. This discovery explains that the city had to be fortified further, which was done in the second half of the fourth century when the barbaric attackers began to really frighten Florence. This must have been the situation of the city when Ambrose, bishop of Milan, came to Florence in 393 and founded the basilica of San Lorenzo, outside the city gate ad aquilonem, but still protected in a certain way. However, the existence of such decadence has been disputed, because in 366 Florence was the capital of a vast province and united Tuscany and Umbria, due to the administrative reform by Diocletian and, until 315, it has been the seat of a bishop.

Metternich said the aims of such a conservative socialism were \"peaceful, class-harmonizing, cosmopolitan, traditional\". Metternich's conservative socialism saw liberalism and nationalism as forms of middle-class dictatorship over the masses. Johann Karl Rodbertus, a monarchist conservative landowner and lawyer who briefly served as minister of education in Prussia in 1848, promoted a form of state socialism led by an enlightened monarchy supporting state regulation of the economy. In the 1880s, Rodbertus' conservative socialism was promoted as a non-revolutionary alternative to social democracy and a means to justify the acceptance of Bismarck's social policies.

Henry's pain is much better controlled. This concerns his doctors who plan to adjust his antibiotic regimen. The plan today is to increase the dosage of the amikacin, and add flagyl and amphotericin. Amphotericin is an anti-fungal medicine, of which I remember nothing from medical school except it's nickname, ampho-terrible, named due to it's uncomfortable side effects. There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. He has a separate rash all over his chest, where we weren't able to clean as well (due to his Hickman catheter) when he was getting his four-times-a-day baths for the thiotepa. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. We changed his bed sheets as he's been sleeping without a diaper because of a chemotherapy induced rash from contact with it. We may need to increase his pain medicine in order for him to tolerate it. As he calmed down he said, \"I don't feel very good.\" He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. We're dealing with, in no particular order: a fever, mucositis which causes him to drool instead of swallow, some intermittent nausea, and a whopper of a rash. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. Henry misses Anna and Sophie, so we added these to their room so that we can talk to them during the day. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! He's liberated in every sense of the word. He and Sophie immediately started playing, and within minutes they were running around the room screaming and jumping as a remote control Tow-mater chased them. Henry then cut off various limbs of his family members, and finally decided to use the chainsaw to give some My Little Ponies a hair cut. It's a little hard for him after his sisters go home, but he really had a ball. I came down early to relive Tara's double shift and found Henry pleasant and ready for the day. He rode the bike out in the hallway and accompanied me to do laundry and down to get my lunch. We are allowed this freedom as he was unhooked at our request for a brief period of time today. As long as he's bathed and changed before we adventure out (and refrain from touching things) we can go where we please for now, despite our 'isolation'. His major disappointment for today was not being able to go into the playroom. He cried very sadly for a time. I was able to distract him and he accepted it for now. It's a good source of distraction and he's come to look forward to it. The full version of the game I think would have been a little overwhelming so we played with them all turned face up. We played for about an hour - he was very attentive. He had some down time in the afternoon and then engaged his nurse with some play about his workbench. She indulged him very enthusiastically. A big relief from what was expected. Today is considered Day Zero, or the day he gets his stem cells, that were harvested from him 3 months ago, put back into his body. On the one hand, everyone tells us that it’s just like hanging another bag of medication, which runs in uneventfully. Well, the runup to the tranplant was truly more exciting than the transplant. I don't find it offensive (some people do) but I'm not planning on suggesting an air freshener line with it. So now we wait for that to happen over the next two weeks. He woke happily and has spent all day in bed. We help him go to the bathroom in a urinal to which he's become accustomed. They had done a stool culture and found something called VRE. To prevent passing it on to others however, he must now be put in ‘isolation’. There are special contact precautions that all the health care workers must take now when entering the room, they must all don gloves and gowns in addition to their masks. Henry cannot go into the hallway without being bathed and his clothes changed. Apparently this condition takes a while to resolve, particularly while resident in the hospital. His eyes lit up and he said, \"I want that choo choo crain\". Sometime during the first game, a child about Henry's age won and picked that train. There was consolation, the prize cart comes around for all participants after the games are over, so no one really gets left out, but try explaining that to Henry. Each time, she would say something like 'pass the phone' and Henry thought it was his newly chosen prize being taken again. There were only two winners left to be awarded. They called 'G - Bottle' and that did it for us. He was very proud of his prize and showed all the nurses that came in and promised to call them on it. He seems very comfortable, and in good spirits, but very tired. We've also been warned that next week will be the week that he feels the worst, so we'll continue to take one day at a time and hope that he feels as good tomorrow as he did today. He tires quickly and seems moments from dropping off to sleep at all times. After all, this is his life and his struggle. He's being forged into such a champion each day. Somehow, perhaps for the better, the time leading up to this round of chemotherapy kept me blissfully ignorant of what was to come. I fell very easily into the rhythm of our new home life and had put behind me the first phase of chemotherapy as difficult but over. This reflection was tossed among the daily rituals that have become normalized in our new view of reality. I felt like I'd come to a calm acceptance of day to day living within our new situation and withheld looking too far into the future for fear of becoming too attached to a positive outcome or too overwhelmed by a negative one. The several days immediately preceding Henry's most recent admission, began to weigh heavier and heavier upon me, a sense of dread mounting with each out patient visit to have him tested for his current functions so we could recognize what the chemotherapy had done to him. At some point during this time, I began to see the chemotherapy, not as medicine, but poison. We were planning to poison my son, because nothing else had any chance of preserving his life. The effects of this poison were to leave him, and those around him for that matter, scarred for life. Hopefully these scars would be minimal - small crosses to bear, the likes of which affect some at random anyhow - infertility or hearing loss for example. This knowledge and the pause before commencing the treatment, left me to stew on the possible outcomes, no longer able to preserve my shelter of ignorance. For the first time since Henry's diagnosis, I found myself angry at this situation. It wasn't a 'why us' kind of anger, but a frustrated, having-been-backed-into-a-corner kind of anger. There was nothing to do but accept it. No pleasure to be taken that would alleviate it. With full knowledge of it's effects, we would administer this poison to our son, hoping that it killed it's target before it ravaged him. I withdrew into myself, not really understanding my feelings well enough to talk about them to anyone. I exercised, meditated, ate better food, tried to relax; all attempts to calm myself about it. Nothing would change what was about to happen. It wasn't until I had my first turn in the hospital with him, seeing him doing well - laughing, playing and entertaining - that I was able to better accept our path. I woke up to a new level of realization and with it, a new wave of grief. Momentarily lifting my head out of my anxiety for our future, I found the effects of Henry's diagnosis rippling out to so many people, some very close and some at a distance. I realized that I've not been as attentive to those immediately around me - my daughters, what is this doing to them? I picture their sweet faces looking up at me with a sad, innocent and inquiring look, eyes welled with tears. I look at my wife and imagine us on our wedding day, never guessing what could lie ahead, wishing to avoid things like this. I see our parents being supportive but looking behind their eyes - I see their empathy for us and their own plight of having a grandchild with cancer, wanting so desperately to help or fix things and not being able to; our relatives, watching and being supportive where possible, going about their normal days only to be reminded suddenly of what's going on at odd moments throughout the day; circles of friends feeling helpless but offering such wonderful support despite it all; parents of our children's friends trying to give answers to their kids - knowing that no kid should have to worry about such things; barely beginning to appreciate the years and years of treatments those families we see in the clinic have endured and are to yet endure; watching kids during chemotherapy and seeing them colorful and playful one minute and ashen and sickly the next. There are days I feel completely inadequate to handle what's been handed us. Other days I feel capable, but wary because I know it's simply a function of time before that changes. In lieu of describing this whirlwind of emotions, my answers are brief and guarded when others ask how we're doing. When people marvel at how we're 'doing it all', I have to think, 'if you only knew'. Yes, there are opportunities for growth in all of this. Adversity does that. But it's difficult to take solace in that. It's a difficult pill to swallow that one's growth is coming at such an expense. But what are we to do? In the face of such a crisis, we pick ourselves up, arming ourselves with the comfort and support of family and friends and make the effort to take one step, one day, one moment at a time. He's been active and aside from not eating much and baths at odd hours of the day, it's not much different than being at home for him. He's got plenty of people to entertain him and lots of toys and distractions. He was, unbelievably, quite eager to come. His fan club of adoring nurses was waiting for him to arrive. He'll be getting Thiotepa for the first three days, which he's never had. Fortunately, they've recently learned ways to prevent this uncomfortable side effect. Due to the immune suppression that he'll have, there are some nursing (and therefore parenting) issues that will be new to us this time. The degree of discomfort varies from patient to patient. It sounds like he handled the first three cycles better than a lot of kids do, so we're hopeful we'll continue to have the same luck. It's what they told us to expect, but with the insurance as the critical dependency, I was kind of hoping for one more weekend. Anna teared up a bit - it gets to her when we're not here consistently and despite being 'annoyed' at him, she misses Henry when he's away. I have this strange conflicting irritation with the kids' minute-by-minute demands whenever we are expecting the hospital. I get frustrated with myself for it, because I feel I should be more patient and appreciative of them at such a time. It's so tumultuous the swirls of emotion rushing around in my head. \"That's OK - I'm used to it.\" Lately Tara and have had the uncomfortable feeling of having received good news regarding Henry's MRI, but having a sense of unease and foreboding. We've presumed it's been because since Henry's diagnosis, we've looked no further than the MRI to prevent our imaginations from running amok with the possible outcomes. Henry has become a pro at these. Having a child with cancer alters your dreams. It changes your perceptions of the world, the people you interact with and the long-held beliefs about everything from what one should expect from everyday life to the metaphysical questions of why we're here. When you laugh, you wonder if you're really allowed. Today we were given a glimpse of the road ahead and there are significant mountains to climb, the descent from which only a few make. Left alone, chances are extremely high that the cancer would return. Near term, Henry will likely face the loss of a significant enough portion of his hearing that he will require a hearing aid. One of the drugs used has already shown Henry's susceptibility to it and we will need to use a much higher dose to have the best chance at eradicating his cancer, but only for one cycle as its planned now. Whereas in the first three cycles, his system had its nadir for approximately 4 days, during this treatment, his system will be compromised for much longer during which he'll stay in the hospital as the risk of leaving is too high. We cannot hope for a better reading that that of late, the best result for Henry's type the transplant doctor said he's seen. So then, we wait. I'm sure it won't be without its obstacles - some of which we've already climbed or skated past. Neither seemed too pleased to meet one another as the wind was howling and there was no predicting which would have the better of the day. It turned out to be sufficient for much of the time to hang out in the provided housing. Being removed from our home environment for a while, without all the usual distractions seemed welcome by everyone. We ended up forced to look at each other with little to do and we enjoyed it! The first night we were once again treated by the kindness of strangers. Some with toys, money for gas, and others with messages of hope. As much practice at accepting these as I think I've had, it's always a surprise and I never really know what to say, beside the obvious 'Thank You'. I feel forever inadequate trying to convey our gratitude. At the 'Believe in Tomorrow: House by the Sea' we were greeted with great smiles and a basket full of coupons and free dinner and activities donated by local merchants. When going to dinner at 'La Hacienda' that first evening we were treated so well and they made a point of wishing us the best. I'm forever amazed at the sources of our community of support. In the meantime we've been able to hide from it for a couple of days and are preparing to face it together. All that we had to do yesterday was get Henry's hearing test and a special treat that had been arranged for us. That special treat was a photo shoot done by Flashes of Hope, an organization that provides photography for children with cancer. I didn't really know what to think of it at first, but as with all things, I came to find out that the people doing this really had their hearts in it and once I saw some of the sample photos, I realized what a valuable gift this would be. He ate up all the attention they were giving him. There were clowns there to entertain those waiting and to draw smiles out of the children being photographed. Henry really pushed the clowns to their limits, \"Daddy, ask the clowns if they have any more cricks\". Apparently the drug can continue to affect hearing for up to 180 days after the treatment. The dosing to come is what is worrisome, but we'll deal with that as it comes. We keep reminding ourselves that Henry's type of medulloblastoma is anaplastic, a very aggressive subtype. All that it takes is one cancer cell to persist and we'll have major setbacks. Talk about a needle in a haystack. We arrived at the clinic before the receptionist and early enough that we got to feed the fish. Fortunately the anesthesiologist, whom we've had - and liked - before, offered to give his sedative in his stroller through his tubes of course. He awoke from these after about half an hour of rest and was very pleasant and didn't complain of any pain the rest of the day. After not eating all morning, Henry made up for it the rest of the day with pizza, chicken and gummy worms. A couple weekends ago, we had a relaxing, laze around the house kind of day, where despite all being cooped up inside we were laid back and didn't get on each others nerves. The weekend that followed was not the same story. We attempted to interrupt the downward spiral with a trip to DC and the Air and Space Museum, but that was useful mostly for occupying the majority of the day and moving our family togetherness beyond the confines of the house. On Saturday we had some family friends over to visit as well as Tara's sister's family. In the afternoon we took a trip up to Mechanicsburg to spend some time with close friends and their twin girls, who are roughly Sophie's age. Henry slept for several hours and were up and off to Frederick for a family dinner with Tara's mom and siblings and their families. He's become very comfortable with the idea of these procedures as long as he's asleep for them. Tara said to me as she was talking to the oncologist on our trip home from Baltimore for Henry's MRI. The relief was palpable. The day itself was not so stressful, in fact Henry was a trooper - hardly complaining about not being able to eat all morning - but the weeks and months leading up to this moment, knowing it was coming, afraid for the results, yet hopeful, but wary...We'd prepared for lukewarm news. This quickly crystallized in my head to mean that the chemotherapy is working brilliantly. Other conclusions washed over me as we continued the drive home. Sheaves of worry lifted from my shoulders as I considered it all. We were braced for harsh reality and got handed another chance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\némile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB.

In 1787, the “Espiritu de los mejores diarios literarios que se publican en Europa“ of Madrid, in Spain, reported Atherton’s latest invention, a revolutionary spinning machine: \"A letter written from London reports that the spinning machine, perfected by Mr. Atherton, spins a pound of cotton, giving the thread a length of 80 miles, which previously was only about 69. [...]In each revolution the main wheel spins 70,728 rods of silk, achieving three revolutions in every minute.

Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 1998, and our headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved our first product, Korlym® (“mifepristone”) 300 mg tablets, as a once-daily oral medication for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Our financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of Corcept Therapeutics UK Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary, which we incorporated in the United Kingdom in March 2017. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions each quarter, including those related to revenue recognition, recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, inventory, allowances for doubtful accounts and other accrued liabilities, including our bonus accrual, clinical trial accruals and stock-based compensation. When choosing which assumptions to rely upon when determining the value of a financial instrument, we look first for quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (“Level 1 inputs”). If no Level 1 inputs are available, we consider (i) quoted prices in non-active markets for identical instruments; (ii) active markets for similar instruments; (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the instrument; and (iv) inputs that are not directly observable, but that are corroborated by observable data (“Level 2 inputs”). We consider highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities, primarily U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate notes, asset backed securities and repurchase agreements. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and report them at fair value as “cash equivalents” or “marketable securities” on our balance sheet, with related unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity. We are subject to credit risk from our cash equivalents and marketable securities. We limit our investments to U.S. Treasury obligations and high-grade corporate debt, asset backed securities and repurchase agreements with less than a 36-month maturity at the time of purchase. Because product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained, we record the cost of manufacturing our product candidates as research and development expenses at the time such costs are incurred. We capitalize to inventory manufacturing costs related to Korlym. We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and determine the cost of inventory we sell using the specific identification method, which approximates a first-in, first-out basis. We write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing Korlym, including materials, third-party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs, based on the number of Korlym tablets for which we recognize revenue, as well as costs of stability testing, logistics and distribution. We classify inventory we do not expect to consume within 12 months of the balance sheet date as strategic inventory, a noncurrent asset. We also sell Korlym to a specialty distributor (“SD”), for which we recognize revenue at the time the SD receives Korlym. To determine our revenue from the sale of Korlym, we (i) identify our contract with each customer; (ii) identify the obligations of Corcept and the customer under the contract; (iii) determine the contracted transaction price; and (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations, which in our case consists of delivering Korlym to the customer; and (v) recognize revenue once Korlym has been delivered, provided we deem it probable that we will collect the payment due to us. Confirmation of coverage by private or government insurance or by a third-party charity is a prerequisite for selling Korlym to a patient. To determine net product revenue, we deduct from sales the cost of our patient co-pay assistance program and our estimates of (a) government chargebacks and rebates, (b) discounts provided to our SD for prompt payment and (c) reserves for expected Korlym returns. We report any such changes in the period they become known, even if they concern transactions occurring in prior periods. To determine the appropriate amount to reserve against these rebates, we identify Korlym sold to patients covered by government-funded programs, apply the applicable government discount to these sales, then estimate, based on our experience, the portion of total rebates we expect will be claimed. We then (i) deduct this reserve from revenue in the period to which the rebates relate and (ii) include in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet a current liability of equal amount. Although we sell Korlym to the SD at full price, some of the government entities to which the SD sells receive a discount. The SD recovers such discounts by reducing its payment to us (this reduction is called a “chargeback”). Chargebacks sometimes relate to Korlym sold to SD in prior periods. We deduct from our revenue in each period chargebacks claimed by the SD for Korlym we sold to the SD that period. We also create a reserve for chargebacks we estimate the SD will claim in future periods against Korlym it purchased in the current period but has not yet resold. We determine the assistance we provide each patient by applying our program guidelines to that patient’s financial position and their insurance policy’s co-payment and deductible requirements for the purchase of Korlym. We deduct the amount of Korlym we estimate the SD will return from each period’s gross revenue. We base our estimates on quantitative and qualitative information including, but not limited to, historical return rates, the amount of Korlym held by the SD and projected demand. Research and development expenses include the direct cost of discovery research, pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing development, submissions to regulatory agencies and related overhead costs. We expense nonrefundable payments and the cost of technologies and materials used in research and development as we incur them. We base our accruals for research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our estimates of work completed, milestones achieved, patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts. Our estimates include assessments of information from third-party contract research organizations and the status of our own clinical trial and other development and administrative activities. We account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method, based on the value of the award at the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. If actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, we adjust stock-based compensation expense accordingly. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which changes the way companies recognize revenue. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and creates a new Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Topic 606 applies to all contracts with customers. We conducted our analysis using the “portfolio of contracts” approach, which permits us to analyze as a group all contracts with similar characteristics. Topic 606 requires us to estimate the net price of each Korlym sale, including any variable consideration, and recognize the estimated amount as revenue at the time we deliver Korlym to the customer. We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2018, with no cumulative effect of adoption being recorded. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This update changes accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash (Topic 230) (ASU 2016-18), which requires the inclusion of restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. 2016-02, “Leases”, which requires the recognition of lease transactions with terms longer than 12 months on the balance sheet as “lease liabilities” and “right-of-use assets.” We plan to adopt this new standard prospectively on January 1, 2019. Although we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard, we expect that adoption will increase our “lease liabilities” and “right-of-use assets” equally. An entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the Act’s change in US federal tax rate for all items accounted for in other comprehensive income. These entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded effects that relate to the Act but do not directly relate to the change in the federal rate. In order to be prepared for potential demand for Korlym and because we rely on single-source manufacturers of both the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for Korlym and Korlym tablets, we have purchased significant inventory quantities of these materials. We classify inventory we do not expect to sell within 12 months of the balance sheet date as “Strategic Inventory,” a long-term asset. The estimated fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices for these or similar investments obtained from a commercial pricing service. The fair value of marketable securities classified within Level 2 is based upon inputs that may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and issuer spreads. As discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Debt Obligation, under the Financing Agreement with Biopharma we made quarterly payments to Biopharma equal to 20 percent of Korlym sales in that quarter. To secure our obligation, we granted Biopharma a security interest in our patents, trademarks, trade names, domain names, copyrights, know-how, books, records and regulatory approvals related to Korlym and certain other assets and any proceeds from them. We capitalized $0.1 million of issuance costs related to the Financing Agreement, which we amortized over the term of the obligation. On February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a 4.6 million share increase in the shares available for grant under the 2012 Plan. We compute basic and diluted net income per share by dividing our net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We used the treasury stock method to determine the number of dilutive shares of common stock resulting from the potential exercise of stock options. Our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation, which increased our tax expense, offset with the benefit related to research and development tax credits and a discrete benefit related to settlement of employee stock options during the reporting period. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes, such as those enacted by the Tax Act, in the period such changes take effect. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see “Forward-Looking Statements” included in “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q and the “Overview” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of the hormone cortisol. Our first approved product, Korlym®, treats patients with Cushing’s syndrome, a rare disease that is caused by excess cortisol activity. The active ingredient in Korlym is mifepristone, a compound that modulates cortisol activity by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (“GR”), one of the body’s two cortisol receptors. We are conducting clinical trials of three compounds from our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, including: (i) a Phase 2 trial of relacorilant to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome; (ii) a Phase 1/2 trial of relacorilant combined with Celgene Corporation’s drug Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) to treat patients with a variety of solid tumors; (iii) a Phase 1/2 trial of CORT125281 combined with Pfizer Inc.’s androgen receptor antagonist Xtandi® (enzalutamide) to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”); and (iv) a Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects to assess the safety and tolerability of CORT118335, which we plan to develop for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has approved Korlym as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Orphan drugs receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval, as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs, marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the FDA in the drug development process. We have three patents listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (known as the “Orange Book”), with terms extending to 2028, 2033 and 2038, respectively, that we believe would be infringed by a generic competitor for Korlym. We sell Korlym exclusively in the United States, using experienced sales representatives targeting the endocrinologists and other specialists caring for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Because many people who suffer from Cushing’s syndrome are undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate physicians and patients about diagnosis of this syndrome and the role cortisol modulators can play in treating the disease. We use one specialty pharmacy and one specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support to physicians and patients. Our policy is that no patient with Cushing’s syndrome will be denied access to Korlym for financial reasons. To help us achieve that goal, we fund our own patient support programs and donate money to independent charitable foundations that help patients cover the cost of all aspects of their Cushing’s syndrome care, whether or not their care includes taking Korlym. Unlike Korlym, it has no affinity for PR and so does not cause the effects associated with PR affinity, including endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. Results from this cohort were positive, including statistically significant improvements in glucose tolerance and serum osteocalcin (a marker of bone growth that is suppressed in Cushing’s syndrome). We have developed an assay to measure expression of the gene FKBP5, which is stimulated by cortisol activity, and conducted analytical validation pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). Many types of solid tumors express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them triple-negative breast, ovarian, castration-resistant prostate, cervical, and pancreatic cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma. Six patients achieved progression-free survival (“PFS”) longer than the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for PFS (15 weeks) in patients receiving Halaven® monotherapy in a comparable population (Aogi et al., Annals of Oncology 23: 1441-1448, 2012). University of Chicago investigators are also conducting a 74-patient, open label trial of Korlym combined with Merck’s drug Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced HER2-negative and triple-negative breast cancer. We are providing Korlym to both trials. Tumors eventually escape androgen deprivation therapy through the proliferation of cells for which cortisol’s stimulation of GR is the primary growth factor. We have begun dosing patients at sites in the United States and Europe in an open label Phase 1/2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator CORT125281 combined with Xtandi in patients with metastatic CRPC. University of Chicago investigators are leading an 84-patient, controlled, multicenter Phase 2 trial of Korlym combined with Xtandi to treat patients with metastatic CRPC. We are providing Korlym. We have exclusively licensed patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of cortisol modulators combined with anticancer agents to treat TNBC and with androgen deprivation agents to treat CRPC. In animal models, our proprietary selective cortisol modulator CORT118335 potently prevents and reverses the weight gain caused by Eli Lilly and Company’s antipsychotic medication Zyprexa® (olanzapine). We conducted these pre-clinical studies in response to reports suggesting that cortisol modulation with Korlym may have played a role in reversing fatty liver disease in patients with Cushing’s syndrome. We are conducting a Phase 1 trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CORT118335. We plan to advance the compound to Phase 2 as a potential treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain and NASH. Our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, which includes relacorilant, CORT125281 and CORT118335, consists of more than 500 compounds in three structurally distinct families. The United States Patent & Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has issued us nine composition of matter patents covering our selective cortisol modulators and 25 method of use patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat a wide range of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome. We have exclusively licensed three U.S. method of use patents from Stanford University and five method of use patents from the University of Chicago. We also own an extensive portfolio of patents in countries around the world. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for U.S. and foreign patents covering the composition and method of use of our product candidates. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower manufacturing costs and an increase in the price of Korlym. Research and development expenses – Research and development expenses include the cost of (1) retaining and compensating development personnel, (2) clinical trials, (3) discovery research and pre-clinical studies, (4) drug product for use in clinical trials and to support regulatory submissions, (5) the development of drug formulations and manufacturing processes and (6) regulatory activities. Research and development expenses increased 137.6 percent to $17.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the clinical advancement of relacorilant and the pre-clinical and clinical development of CORT118335 and CORT125281. It is difficult to predict the timing and cost of development activities, which are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including inconclusive results, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects and unforeseen difficulties in the formulation or manufacture of study drugs and their real or perceived lack of efficacy or safety. Since 2012, we have relied on revenues from the sale of Korlym and proceeds from the sale of common stock and the now repaid Financing Agreement with Biopharma to fund our operations. Based on our current plans, which include fully funding our Cushing’s syndrome commercial operations, conducting Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of relacorilant in both Cushing’s syndrome and solid tumors, the development of CORT125281 to treat patients with CRPC and CORT118335 to treat patients with antipsychotic-induced weight gain and NASH, we expect to fund our operations without needing to raise additional funds, although we may choose to raise additional funds to finance our strategic priorities. Funds raised through collaborations with other companies may require us to relinquish certain rights in our product candidates. At March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $140.4 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $33.1 million and marketable securities of $107.3 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $31.1 million and marketable securities of $73.0 million at December 31, 2017. On February 5, 2018, we received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of Korlym in the United States. The Notice Letter contains Paragraph IV certifications against certain of our patents related to Korlym, U.S. Patent No. 8,921,348 (the “‘348 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 9,829,495 (the “‘495 patent,” and together with the ‘348 patent the “Korlym patents”), which are listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (referred to as the “Orange Book”). The Notice Letter alleges that the Korlym patents, the ‘348 patent with an expiration date in August 2028 and the ‘495 patent with an expiration date in August 2036, will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed product, are invalid and/or are unenforceable. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of having filed a timely lawsuit against Teva, FDA approval of Teva’s ANDA will be stayed until the earlier of (i) 30 months from our February 5, 2018 receipt of Teva’s Paragraph IV Notice Letter or (ii) a District Court decision finding that the identified patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We will vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to Korlym, but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Failure to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of Korlym would harm our financial results and would likely cause our stock price to decline. rapid technological change that makes Korlym obsolete. Failure to generate sufficient Korlym revenue would prevent us from fully funding our planned commercial and clinical activities and would likely cause our stock price to decline. Korlym’s orphan drug designation does not bar other companies from developing different medications to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome. The availability of competing treatments could limit our revenue from the sale of Korlym for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome or other indications. Although we have received orphan drug designation and exclusivity for Korlym for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome in the United States, the FDA may approve other drugs for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome. In 2012, Novartis received approval in both the United States and the European Union (“EU”) to market its somatostatin analogue Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection for adult patients with Cushing’s disease (a subset of Cushing’s syndrome that accounts for approximately 70 percent of all patients with Cushing’s syndrome) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative. In addition, Novartis is conducting Phase 3 trials of the experimental cortisol synthesis inhibitor osilodrostat to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome and has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for that use. Strongbridge Biopharma plc (“Strongbridge”) has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of the cortisol synthesis inhibitor levoketoconazole to treat Cushing’s syndrome and is conducting Phase 3 trials in Europe and the United States for this indication. If generic products that compete with Korlym or any future Corcept product are approved and launched, our business would be adversely affected. Although Korlym is covered by patents covering its method of use, including its use to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome, we cannot assure you that third parties will not attempt to invalidate or design around the patents, or assert that they are invalid or otherwise unenforceable, and introduce generic equivalents of Korlym or any future products. Once orphan drug exclusivity for Korlym in the United States for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome expires in February 2019, other companies could attempt to introduce generic equivalents of these products if they do not infringe our patents or can demonstrate that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. After the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the prescriptions written for a product may be filled with the generic version, resulting in a loss in sales of the branded product and reducing its price. Generic competition for Korlym or our future products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In February 2018, we received notice that Teva had filed an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) requesting approval to market a generic version of Korlym. The notice included a “Paragraph IV” certification stating that our patents listed in the Orange Book for Korlym are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed generic product. Corcept has filed suit against Teva in Federal District Court defending its patents, triggering the statutory automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval. Litigation to enforce or defend intellectual property rights is complex, costly and involves significant commitments of management time. If we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, we will be unable to generate significant revenues. The commercial success of Korlym depends on the availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement. If government or private payors cease to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, physicians may not prescribe the medication and patients may not purchase it, even if it is prescribed. Also, the trends toward managed health care in the United States and recent laws and legislation intended to increase the public visibility of drug prices and reduce the cost of government and private insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for Korlym. The PPACA, among other things, expanded Medicaid program eligibility and access to commercial health insurance coverage, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed another Executive Order directing federal agencies to expand access to alternative health plans and health reimbursement arrangements, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would immediately cease making Cost-Sharing Reduction (“CSR”) payments to issuers of qualified health plans. Any new limitations on, changes to, or uncertainty with respect to the ability of individuals to enroll in governmental reimbursement programs or other third-party payor insurance plans could impact demand for Korlym, which in turn could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that revised certain requirements involved in our calculation of prices we report in connection with our participation in government reimbursement programs so that Korlym will be eligible for purchase by, or qualify for partial or full reimbursement from, Medicaid and other government programs. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could materially reduce our ability to successfully develop and commercialize Korlym and our product candidates. A single third-party manufacturer, PCAS, supplies the API in Korlym. One specialty pharmacy, Optime Care, Inc., dispenses the Korlym we sell directly to patients, which represents approximately 99 percent of our revenue. If any of these vendors is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we may not be able to manufacture or dispense our product in a timely manner. Our arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by them, subject to notice provisions. The facilities used by our vendors to manufacture and package Korlym and our product candidates must be approved by the FDA and, in some cases, the EMA. We do not control the manufacturing activities of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”). If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws its approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and market our products. In addition, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulators to approve our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. In addition to meeting stringent regulatory requirements, our suppliers must manufacture Korlym and our product candidates on a timely basis in the quantities that we require. If they fail to do so, we may exhaust our Korlym or product candidate inventory and not be able to generate revenue or advance our clinical development programs in a timely manner. We may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that Korlym or one of our product candidates has caused adverse effects. Such a claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about Korlym or our product candidates’ safety and could prevent or interfere with product commercialization. Because the active ingredient in Korlym is used to terminate pregnancy, clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women must take strict precautions to ensure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Korlym or our product candidates or could result in meaningful underinsured or uninsured liability. If we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome or if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to generate revenue or may be subject to penalties and our business would be harmed. and U.S. regulatory requirements, may subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, holds on clinical trials, product seizure or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, restrictions on product marketing, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental NDAs, and suspension or revocation of product approvals. For example, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, revising the rules governing net operating losses and foreign tax credits, and introducing new anti-base erosion provisions. We may be subject to civil or criminal penalties if we market Korlym in a manner that violates FDA regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws. In the United States, we market Korlym to treat hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Other federal or state enforcement authorities might act if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Although we have policies and procedures prohibiting such activity, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct and the precautions we take may not be effective in controlling unknown risks or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. A break-down or breach of our information technology systems or our failure to protect adequately confidential information concerning patients or other third-parties could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. Our business is vulnerable to damage from various types of natural disasters or other disruptive events, including earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses and communications failures. In addition, political considerations relating to mifepristone put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks, protests or other disruptive events. If a disaster or similar event were to occur, we might not be able to operate our business or our manufacturers might not be able to produce or dispense Korlym or our product candidates. If we or any of the third-parties working with us fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our trials may be unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving a product candidate. In addition, failure of our manufacturers to comply with cGMP may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay regulatory approval. We may not be able to select and qualify appropriate sites for our trials. If our clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely way, we may be unable to complete our trials as planned, which could delay or prevent the approval of our product candidates. If the third-parties on which we rely do not perform their contractual duties or fail to meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they produce is compromised, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain approval for our product candidates. In order to receive approval from the FDA for a product candidate, we must demonstrate that the new drug product is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes for the product candidate comply with cGMPs, which govern production processes, quality control and recordkeeping. Future governmental action or changes in FDA policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an NDA or supplemental NDA in the United States. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates abroad. approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any foreign market. Although we have received orphan drug designation in the EU of Korlym to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome, we do not plan to seek any foreign approvals for that product. We face competition from companies with financial, technical and marketing resources substantially greater than our own. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater experience, more financial and marketing resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, many of them, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in drug development, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercializing products. They may develop drugs that are superior to our product candidates, which could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize product candidates beyond Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome are at an early stage and we may fail to successfully commercialize any of them. To develop additional sources of revenue, we must develop new product candidates or new therapeutic uses for Korlym. The compounds developed pursuant to our early discovery, preclinical and clinical research programs may fail to become approved medications, no matter how much management time and money we spend on their development. After a product candidate is identified, we may abandon further development efforts after expending significant expense and time due to financial constraints, concerns over safety or efficacy, marketing considerations, manufacturing difficulties or other reasons. Moreover, governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that limit or restrict our development efforts. We will need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing growth. develop our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls. If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts. Our ability to operate successfully and manage growth depends significantly upon retaining key managerial, scientific, sales, marketing, and financial personnel. We depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. Such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We are dependent on revenue from the sale of Korlym to fund our development programs. If our Korlym revenues decline or fail to grow, we may need to raise funds to support our operating plans, including our research and development activities. If we obtain funds through collaborations with other companies, those arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to Korlym or our product candidates. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations. If we acquire other potential products, we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. However, if appropriate opportunities arise, we may attempt to acquire products or product candidates that complement our operating plan. Acquiring rights to another potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would be spent developing our existing business. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, which could dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest or cause us to incur debt, expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets. If Korlym or our other product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes, we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license or may be barred from commercializing our product candidates or Korlym for a new indication. Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the composition of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators and their methods of use and the use of Korlym to treat Cushing’s syndrome, TNBC and CRPC. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may erode our competitive advantage. In March 2018, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. for infringement of Corcept patents covering the use of Korlym® (mifepristone) Tablets, 300 mg. Our product candidates may give rise to claims that our patents or the patents we have licensed are invalid or that we infringe on the rights of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation. If it is determined that our product candidates infringe others’ patent rights, we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights. If we fail to obtain licenses when necessary, we may have to delay commercializing our product candidates while we attempt to design around the infringed patent. We could fail and may be unable to commercialize our product candidates. We are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property except to Stanford University and the University of Chicago. To maintain the exclusive license to these patents, we must make milestone and royalty payments to both universities. If we do not comply with our obligations under our licenses, we may lose the right to commercialize cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, for the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis, early dementia, TNBC and CRPC. Our patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third-parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents. Our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents, and any patent issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Our patent claims may not prevent third-parties from producing competing products. The foreign countries in which we may someday operate may not protect our intellectual property to the extent of the laws of the United States. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection in other countries, our competitors may produce competing products in those countries based on our technology, which would impair our ability to succeed. If a third-party successfully asserted an infringement claim against us, we could be forced to obtain an expensive license or pay damages and be prevented from developing, manufacturing or marketing our potential products. We do not have liability insurance for patent infringement. Patent litigation could consume a substantial portion of our resources and management time. Regardless of a claim’s merit, defending a lawsuit is expensive and diverts management’s attention from productive business. Our ability to compete could be diminished if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our proprietary information. We own or have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat a variety of disorders, including TNBC and CRPC. A method of use patent covers only a particular use of a compound, not its composition. Because our patents do not cover the composition of mifepristone, we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone to treat disorders not covered by our method of use patents. Although distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician’s office and covered by other restrictions, we cannot be certain that patients with Cushing’s syndrome will not be able to obtain mifepristone from this or other sources, should another company receive approval to market mifepristone for another indication. We cannot assure that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any particular time. Holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active. Stock prices, especially those of biotechnology companies, sometimes experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance or prospects. This volatility may significantly reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Securities class-action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of stock market volatility. There are inherent difficulties in predicting the amount of Korlym that will be sold. For example, the rate of physician adoption of Korlym is uncertain. Research analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports. The market for our common stock may be affected by the reports financial analysts publish about us. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our stock in the public market could reduce its price. As additional shares of our stock become available for resale in the public market, whether by the exercise of stock options by employees or directors or because of an equity financing by us, the supply of our stock will increase, which could cause its price to fall. Our officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions. Acting together, these stockholders could significantly influence any matter requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. The interests of this group may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because many investors perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. New laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, including statutes and regulations concerning the development, approval, and marketing of medications, the provisions of the PPACA requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ Capital Market have and will likely continue to increase our cost of doing business. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could reduce the price that investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would otherwise be.
