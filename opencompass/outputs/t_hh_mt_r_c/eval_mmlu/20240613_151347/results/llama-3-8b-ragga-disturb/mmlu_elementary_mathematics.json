Thus, using the distributive rule, (9×n + a)×(9×m + b)= 9×9×n×m + 9(am + bn) + ab. Since the first two factors are multiplied by 9, their sums will end up being 9 or 0, leaving us with 'ab'. We would expect that in any base system, the number before that base would behave just like the nine. For example, 46310 can be transformed into a factorial representation by these successive divisions: The process terminates when the quotient reaches zero. Reading the remainders backward gives 3:4:1:0:1:0!. The corresponding place values are therefore 1/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, ..., 1/n!, etc. Taking alternating values, we have gcd(28, 126, 120) = 2 = gcd(56, 210, 36).

Two such multiples can be subtracted (q0 = 2), leaving a remainder of 147:  1071 = 2 × 462 + 147. Then multiples of 147 are subtracted from 462 until the remainder is less than 147. Three multiples can be subtracted (q1 = 3), leaving a remainder of 21:  462 = 3 × 147 + 21. Then multiples of 21 are subtracted from 147 until the remainder is less than 21. Seven multiples can be subtracted (q2 = 7), leaving no remainder:  147 = 7 × 21 + 0. If the quotient is 2 or 3, divide the remainder ((x-1) modulo 32) by 13; if the quotient here is 0, output x+13; if 1, output x-13; if 2, output x. Regarding the division algorithm, when dividing y by z to get a quotient q and remainder r, there is an outer loop which sets q and r first to the quotient and remainder of 1/z, then to those of 2/z, and so on; after it has executed y times, this outer loop terminates, leaving \n\n sequence, continuing until the digits in the dividend have been exhausted: 1 0 1       ___________ 1 0 1  ) 1 1 0 1 1        − 1 0 1          -              1 1 1          −   1 0 1              -              0 1 0 Thus, the quotient of 110112 divided by 1012 is 1012, as shown on the top line, while the remainder, shown on the bottom line, is 102. In decimal, this corresponds to the fact that 27 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 2.

Multi-day rides, with multiple endurance rides on at least consecutive days and totaling at least 155 miles, usually offer their awards to recognize horses who successfully complete all days of the ride. These rides \n\n Eddington is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist's long-distance riding achievements. The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days. For example, an Eddington number of 70 miles would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on at least 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will (probably) require more than five new long distance rides, since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. For example, in cycling an E of 62 miles means a cyclist has covered 62 miles at least 62 times. The distance 62 miles is equivalent to 100 kilometers. While the distances 100 kilometers and 62 miles are equivalent, an E of 100 kilometers would require 38 more rides of that length than an E of 62 miles.

High-end soaps may be sold with their own dishes, typically made of either wood or ceramic, and be formed to fit the dish with which the puck is sold. The library at Sir Henry's house Rodney's attempt to buy and re-sell soap from Sir Henry's factories has quickly come to his father's notice. He is completely certain that no amount of advertising could make such excessively overpriced soap sellable. He is then greatly nonplussed to discover that Lewis's are keen to obtain the remaining 45,000 bars, as the advertising campaign has created a huge demand. She is seeking to swindle him by pretending to have been swindled by Rodney and extracting redress from his father, but Peale arrives and exposes her. Sir Henry decides that Rodney's much sought-after brand of soap is a commercial winner. Shaving soaps are also approved by the Transportation Security Administration and other airport security agencies as permitted in carry-on luggage. Shaving soaps typically cost more initially, when the shaving mug and soap is purchased. These costs can be significantly reduced by using mugs and bowls found in the kitchen, or purchased for a small amount at resale stores. Even though shaving soaps may cost more initially when buying the soap and equipment, over a longer period of time, shaving soaps are comparable in cost, or even cheaper than many shaving creams. besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, and also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. Swan was a brand of soap introduced by the Lever Brothers Company in 1941 to compete with Ivory.

If the set contains an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the set contains an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. For simplicity, consider the set of numbers respectively. However, it is more ideal to take the mean of these weighted medians when it makes sense instead. Coincidentally, both the weighted median and median are equal to 2.5, but this will not always hold true for larger sets depending on the weight distribution. The middle value of a series of given data, arranged in either ascending or descending order, is called the median. The median is an essential measure of central tendency and is often used in statistics and data analysis. To find the median, you need to arrange the given data in order from least to greatest or vice versa. For example, if the data set has values {3, 6, 8, 10, 15}, the median is 8, which is the value in the middle. To find the median, we calculate the average of 7 and 9, resulting in a median of 8. The median is a useful measure because it is not influenced by extreme values, also known as outliers, which can significantly affect the mean or average of a data set. In summary, the middle value of a series of given data arranged in ascending or descending order is called the median. The median is a robust measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers. In the event that the upper and lower weighted medians are equal, the lower weighted median is generally accepted as originally proposed by Edgeworth.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about elementary mathematics.
