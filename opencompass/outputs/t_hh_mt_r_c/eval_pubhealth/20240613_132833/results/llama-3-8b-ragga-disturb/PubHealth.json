Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications. Signs and symptoms\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission\n\nVirology\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. Immunopathology\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors\n\nVirus proteins\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine response\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon. Pregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:\n Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Diagnosis\n\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testing\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Imaging\n\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%). The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that \"Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.\" Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. Treatment\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. Children\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Longer-term effects\n\nSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. Immunity\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. Reinfection with COVID‑19 is possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US. Infection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. On 2July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%. One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58). The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. Comorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. History\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered. The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. , Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. Misinformation\n\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online. Other species\n\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. , hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. , more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far. Treatment-related research\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. Cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is undergoing a PhaseII non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade\nThere was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu.

The study also estimates the risk level to health workers, compared with the general public. Using data from the app, researchers were able to identify six distinct types of COVID-19 and forecast which initial symptoms were more likely to lead to severe illnesses.

The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients. A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial. In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty\nBased on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil \nDespite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.\n\nEfficacy and clinical trials\nIn 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects\nLY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development\nIn August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score.

Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.\nAmicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. [Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. These groups are: pregnant women; people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age; health care and emergency services personnel; persons between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; and people from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for severe disease because of chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes, or compromised immune systems. In addition, ACIP recommended that local public health authorities may want to prioritize a smaller group of people while supplies are limited, in which case the following groups who are at the highest risk for infection or severe illness should receive the vaccine before others: pregnant women, people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency medical services personnel with direct patient contact, children 6 months through 4 years of age, and children 5 through 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions. So far the reports of adverse events among H1N1 vaccination are generally mild and are similar to those we see with seasonal flu vaccine. CDC and FDA have been working to enhance surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events among vaccinated persons and to adjust the vaccination program to minimize these risks. These systems are designed to determine whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate than among unvaccinated persons. In the spring, anticipating commercial market constraints, HHS deployed 11 million courses of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ensure the nation was positioned to quickly employ these drugs to combat 2009 H1N1 and its spread. In early October, HHS shipped an additional 300,000 bottles of the oral suspension formulation of the antiviral oseltamivir to states in order to mitigate a predicted near-term national shortage indicated by commercial supply data. Finally, CDC and FDA have also worked together to address potential options for treatment of seriously ill hospitalized patients with influenza, including situations in which physicians may wish to use investigational formulations of antiviral drugs for intravenous therapy. There have been enormous efforts in the United States and abroad to prepare for this kind of challenge. Deutsche Welle describes ITN as a party that could \"turn anti-vax into state policy\", stating that the party's parliamentary head, Toshko Yordanov, had supported and spread anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in parliament by claiming that vaccines do not reduce COVID-19 transmission. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented \"discrimination\" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide. Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it. This includes Germany who limited it to people over age 60 and France who limited it to people over \n\nThe TeamHeath Medical Call Center (THMCC) is one of the country’s most established, reputable and sought after providers of telephone nurse triage clinical care.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available. Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development. Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells. Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development. Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years. the USA. ; Inclusion criteria are pre-symptomatic late infantiles and both pre- and early-symptomatic juveniles. ; The trial was at a single center at the San Raffaele Institute in Milan, Italy. The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ; In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare \n\n York City. More recently gene therapy has been attempted as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva's blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them. This, augmented by weekly injections of ADA, corrected her deficiency.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths. All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices. The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. It is important to note that the information provided here is not exhaustive, and healthcare professionals should rely on up-to-date guidelines and research to diagnose and treat patients with VAPI. Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health. Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available. Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs. About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart. It reported on a study that divided 70 cardiac patients into two equal groups: one group was injected with stem cells, and the other group received a placebo. A study looking at safety and feasibility of infusing cord blood stem cells into the hearts of babies born with a defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is nearing completion, and we have already heard of one family who is sleeping better knowing their little boy is on the road to recovery. This would normally require the patient to undergo a heart transplant later down the road, but researchers think an infusion of cord blood could solve the problem by making the right side of the heart two times to five times stronger. “And if we make it strong enough, we believe that that has a shot at delaying and preventing transplant for a significant number of these children.\" After collecting the cord blood at the time of birth, processing it in Minnesota and cryo-preserving it for three months, the cord blood stem cells were thawed and infused directly into Ryals’s heart near the end of his second operation. In 2007, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a world-famous heart surgeon based at Imperial College London, and a team of researchers developed heart valve cells with stem cells. Presenting at the American Heart Association's annual scientific sessions in New Orleans during November 2008, cardiac surgeon Dr. Ralf Sodian reported that his team had used stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood to create tissue-engineered heart valves. Stem cells collected at birth from the umbilical cord may help doctors fashion new heart valves for children born with heart valve defects. In Circulation Research, Timothy Kamp, co-director of the university's Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Center, reported that the reprogrammed heart cells made in the laboratory generated electrical pulses, and in response to these pulses, they contracted. \"If you have a heart failure patient who is in dire straits and there are never enough donor hearts for transplantation, we may be able to make heart cells from the patient's skin cells and use them to repair heart muscle. A 2014 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 1,255 participants showed a reduce risk of mortality or re-hospitalization in the long-term for patients who underwent a stem cell therapy for heart disease. As scientists have been better developing an understanding of how these stem cells are aiding heart repair, they have moved more and more towards mesenchymal stem cells as a source. Today, more and more clinical trials using stem cells like those found in cord tissue are being used to treat heart disease. As scientists gain further insight into how, when, which and to what capacity stem cells can be used to treat heart conditions through these clinical trials, we grow ever closer to potentially discovering a whole new way to mend a broken heart. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was \n\nUnder a microscope inside a lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center, a dish of cells pulsates with the rhythm of a human heart. Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions. They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming. Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics. Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues. In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss. Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver. At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells. The center, led by biologist Eric Olson, opened in May with a $10 million gift from the Hamon Charitable Foundation. Olson hopes the center will help UT Southwestern attract top college graduates from around the U.S.\nOlson’s career-long interest in how a single cell develops into the trillions that make up the human body led to his lab’s current work. “I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process. In the center’s inaugural publication this month in the journal Science, Olson and his colleagues outlined a way to “edit” the gene abnormalities responsible for the disorder in a mouse and rectify the body’s ability to grow healthy muscle. “I was trained as a pediatric cardiologist and was interested in how the heart forms in the embryo and how that goes awry in human disease,” says Srivastava, who now directs cardiac and stem cell research at the Gladstone Institutes and is a professor at the University of California San Francisco. The two went on to discover many of the genes that control heart development. In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients. Those ingredients, proteins known as transcription factors, are master regulators that flip genes on and off. The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb. Each group used a different combination of transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that the technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack. For the last two decades, stem cells have been virtually synonymous with regenerative medicine. Scientists use them in many different ways. In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue. In a second approach, scientists can extract stem cells from embryos and then convert them. In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells. Adult stem cells have had mixed results. So far, researchers have tried direct reprogramming in mice and in human cells in a lab dish. He starts with glial cells, which reproduce in the brain and spinal cord following an injury and can form scars. Most scientists who work on direct reprogramming are continuing their research on stem cells in parallel. Another advantage of using stem cells is that the process creates a lot more cells to work with than direct reprogramming. “Right now, if you take a dish of fibroblasts in a lab and reprogram that dish, you can get maybe 10 percent of those cells to turn into heart muscle cells, and we’d like to improve that efficiency,” says Olson. Yet direct reprogramming, says Zhang, is more akin to true regeneration. “We design a way to help the tissue repair or regenerate itself,” he says. Stem cells, by contrast, involve growing cells in a dish and then injecting them into patients. The ultimate hope with direct reprogramming is that it will lead to a drug that will stimulate patients’ bodies to heal themselves. Srivastava is testing his direct reprogramming technique in pigs, whose hearts are closer in size to those of humans. The goal is to see if he can generate enough muscle to dramatically improve the heart’s pumping ability. to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense (\"buoyant\") LDL. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a better way to calculate more precisely the level of so-called bad cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. “The traditional way of measuring LDL cholesterol too often underestimates it,” says Johns Hopkins cardiologist Steven Jones, M.D. There are several types, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps remove cholesterol from the arteries and prevent fatty buildup, and various non-HDL lipoproteins, which in excess are linked to artery damage, heart disease and stroke. These include intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Nearly one in four people found to have LDL cholesterol in the “desirable” level through the traditional calculation method actually may have needed more aggressive treatment, according to a study at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine published in 2013 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Results show three easily measured scores: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, another type of fat molecule. Also included is LDL cholesterol, which is normally estimated rather than directly measured. To calculate LDL, labs use a formula known as the Friedewald equation, a more expedient way to assess LDL compared with actually measuring it, (which involves a cumbersome and expensive process called ultracentrifugation). But Johns Hopkins researchers found that this often makes LDL cholesterol appear lower than it really is for some high-risk patients. Because it’s individualized and looks at all non-HDL cholesterol—not just LDL—it can be used to make more precise decisions about treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke. “LDL cholesterol alone is a relatively poor predictor of your risk,” Jones says. This newer LDL cholesterol formula is being adopted by U.S. laboratories as well as others around the world. Accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease. LDL cholesterol, also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, which can harden and narrow the arteries. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a more precise calculation method that provides a more individualized and accurate assessment of risks associated with LDL cholesterol. Regular screening and monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels can help guide treatment decisions and interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regular monitoring and management of LDL cholesterol levels are essential for maintaining heart health. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206. J Orthop Trauma 2000; 14: 36-40. Xuhui L.

While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative. The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively. Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable. usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths. The report points to things such as impulse control, and access to means of self-harm such as firearms and prescription drugs. According to the report, 16 percent of North Carolina high school students reported considering suicide in 2017. There is a high stigma against mental illness. Suicide is a problem in Indonesia and in 2018 ranks 65 with 2.9 suicides per 100,000. Suicides are often unreported due to stigma, approximately 10,000 people commit suicide per year.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The result is testosterone levels similar to those that occur after surgical castration or with estrogen. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. LHRH antagonists. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped. Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like \n\n and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total).

Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. \"We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia,\" said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish \"bricks\" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. \"Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain.\" My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora.

Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento, and her team report, \"Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome.\" In a 4-week study, 18 children, ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, with autistic spectrum disorder and/or fragile X syndrome were given either 3 mg melatonin or placebo each night for 2 weeks. The children then \"crossed over\" to the other treatment group for 2 weeks. The main feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Sleep problems are reported in the vast majority of children with autism and fragile X syndrome. The syndrome affects 2 to 4 percent of those with autism spectrum disorder, and symptoms of autism are common in children with fragile X. Having a parent or a mother with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia increases a child's risk of having autism. Low birth weight and preterm delivery are a cause. Advanced parental age appears to increase autism risk in children, and the risk is seen with both mothers and fathers. Pediatrics, 2010. Expectant mothers suffering from asthma, allergies or a type of skin disease have a higher risk of giving birth to an autistic child. Obese mothers are more likely to have autistic children. Environmental pollutants, in addition to genetics, play a role in autism development. Children whose mothers took certain asthma drugs during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of autism. The study, published online Jan. 6 2016 in Pediatrics, found a connection between autism risk and prenatal exposure to drugs called beta-agonists. Children living in an area of New York state that uses aerial pesticides to control mosquitoes have a higher rate of autism than children in neighboring areas. Is it possible that children given too many vaccines could develop signs of autism? There is a debate in the medical community regarding the role of vaccines in causing or precipitating autism. Over the past two decades so many new vaccines have been added to a child's vaccination list that the medical community has little idea how all of these interact with each other and how they influence the immune system and neural tissue. There does not appear to be a link between the season or month a child is born and the subsequent risk. I have not seen any evidence that autism is a result of toxins or toxic metals. There are three large categories of autism treatment: Behavioral modification and communication approaches, dietary and nutritional approaches, complementary approaches. Tests on the brain tissue of 11 patients with autism who had died and spinal fluid from six living children with autism showed the activation of immune system responses. In a study published in the online edition of the Annals of Neurology, researchers said they found abnormal activity by immune system signaling chemicals called chemokines in the autistic patients. This ongoing inflammatory process was present in different areas of the brain and produced by cells known as microglia and astroglia. We didn't see as big of a change in him until the last 3 months when we put him on a GFCF diet ( flucose free casein free ) and had a local allergy doctor, Dr. Baptist recommend a bunch of supplements and B-12 injections. Any opinions about chelation therapy? I am not familiar with the use of chelation therapy for autism but I would be cautious.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as \"scientifically unproven and dangerous\". Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Suzanne Somers has had a multifaceted career with several notable accomplishments. She has authored a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006). This book delves into the topic of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and offers insights into this specific approach to hormone therapy. Furthermore, Somers has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and even a book of poetry, showcasing her diverse range of interests and talents. Throughout her career, Suzanne Somers has been a strong advocate for various health-related issues. However, her views on some medical subjects have faced criticism. She has faced scrutiny for her support of the Wiley Protocol, which is deemed \"scientifically unproven and dangerous.\" Additionally, her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has drawn criticism from the American Cancer Society. It is worth noting that while Somers has achieved success in her career, her ventures into health-related advocacy have been met with controversy.

Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Personal life\nBorn Suzanne Marie Mahoney in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California, Somers is the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. \"Breaking Through\nIn 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom.

In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. \"It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future,\" he tells WebMD. The new drug works differently than statins do. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins. Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD. This REGN727 study was funded by Sanofi U.S. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which make the drug. Adding an experimental new biologic drug to conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in better cholesterol control and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke, according to a new study. The findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained. \"This is a new class of drugs. \"Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up. Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, \"have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. A second preliminary study to be presented Sunday at the cardiology meeting found that another experimental drug, alirocumab, also lowered levels of LDL cholesterol when combined with statin therapy. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 27,564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg per deciliter. Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. A year and a half after its feted approval, a new cholesterol drug has passed a key test. Those benefits are clinically significant, not just statistically significant, and in a conference call hosted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc.'s senior biotech analyst Salim Syed, James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School and president-elect of the national lipid association, stressed the good news about the results. \"There are an very bad lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down\". Almost all were taking modest or large doses of statins. \"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine\". \"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres\". inhibitors have been researched to improve HDL concentrations, but so far, despite dramatically increasing HDL-C, have not had a consistent track record in reducing atherosclerosis disease events. Some have increased mortality rates compared with placebo. ; Clofibrate is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, but has been associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with other strategies. ; Some Tocotrienols, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Visine Original\nThe active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels.

Adverse effects\n\nThose using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application. These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye.

Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years. • Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years. • To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. • Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated. Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena. FDA approves Bayer’s Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg for prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a \"black box\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods. In 2003, the FDA rejected Intrinsa, a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The reasons cited were limited efficacy (about one additional sexually satisfying event per month), concerns about safety and potential adverse effects with long-term therapy, and concerns about inappropriate off-label use.

In the Blackhawks’ penultimate 2016–17 regular season game, Nick Ritchie of the Anaheim Ducks punched Rozsíval in the face as retaliation for a cross-check he delivered to Corey Perry. Rozsíval suffered a facial fracture that required surgical repairs. Rozsíval missed the Blackhawks 2016–17 finale and the entire 2017 playoffs due to the injury. He was later diagnosed with post-concussion symptoms and was placed on the Blackhawks long-term disabled list before the 2017–18 NHL season. He was again replace by Ullmark as the team's starter before he was injured during a game against the Ottawa Senators in late January. Due to this injury, Hutton was appointed the starter with rookie Jonas Johansson as his backup. Boeser was injured in a game against the New York Islanders on March 5, 2018, when he collided with Cal Clutterbuck and the Canucks bench.

The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. I held a newborn in my arms who had a severely deformed and tiny head, CRS. ​Congenital rubella can also occur when a newly pregnant woman or a woman about to get pregnant is given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The CDC warns that the MMR vaccine, “should not be administered to women known to be pregnant. Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source). ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit? Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits. Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are in a fast and furious race to develop another vaccine … against the Zika virus. abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. A public health emergency was also announced in Puerto Rico by Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Sylvia Burwell at the behest of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, suggesting that \n\nZika fever, also known as Zika virus disease or simply Zika, is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission \nIn response to the widespread transmission of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak and concerns of viral genetic material detected in breast milk the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Guideline of infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission, first in 2016 and updated in 2021, where the evidence showed that despite the detection of Zika virus in breast milk, there is unclear evidence of transmission to the infant, and considering that Zika virus infection among infants is mild, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Development was a priority of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but officials stated that development of a vaccine could take years. Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A 1954 study assessing blood samples from several people from different states found antibodies to Zika in healthy people in India which could indicate past exposure, though it could also be due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses. Before 2007, there were only 13 reported natural infections with Zika virus, all with a mild, self-limited febrile illness. Yap Islands \nThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. A total of 108 cases were confirmed by PCR or serology and 72 additional cases were suspected. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. Zika also appears to have an equal tropism for cells of the developing eye, leading to high rates of eye abnormalities as well. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells. A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses. Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and Zika). In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika.

Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. Zika also appears to have an equal tropism for cells of the developing eye, leading to high rates of eye abnormalities as well. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells. A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses. Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and Zika). In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission \nIn response to the widespread transmission of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak and concerns of viral genetic material detected in breast milk the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Guideline of infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission, first in 2016 and updated in 2021, where the evidence showed that despite the detection of Zika virus in breast milk, there is unclear evidence of transmission to the infant, and considering that Zika virus infection among infants is mild, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Development was a priority of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but officials stated that development of a vaccine could take years. Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A 1954 study assessing blood samples from several people from different states found antibodies to Zika in healthy people in India which could indicate past exposure, though it could also be due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses. Before 2007, there were only 13 reported natural infections with Zika virus, all with a mild, self-limited febrile illness. Yap Islands \nThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. A total of 108 cases were confirmed by PCR or serology and 72 additional cases were suspected. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement.

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. Labels such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder are becoming so common place, that teachers themselves are expected to not only recognise children with these labels, but to also provide appropriate support for them within the classroom setting. But what if this new label could actually explain many of the difficulties a child is experiencing and may actually result in the removal of some of the other labels? This is potentially the case for children affected by aspects of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them. Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed. At one end of the CVI continuum, there are children who are functionally blind and don’t appear to be able to “see” the world around them. Fortunately, these children are more likely to receive an overall diagnosis of CVI, as their visual issues are more obvious. However, at the other end of the continuum, are children who may appear to have normal or near normal visual acuity when assessed by an optometrist (meaning that they are able to read to a level on the eye chart that is considered within normal range i.e. Despite having normal or near normal visual acuity however, many children are greatly affected by what is commonly referred to as visual perceptual difficulties. - fatigues easily and appears to get frustrated / anxious easily. Another important aspect of visual perceptual difficulties, is that these issues are made worse when the environment around a person with these difficulties is cluttered. When children are diagnosed with certain impairments such as: ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder, tools and teaching strategies are implemented in the classroom to help ensure the child has the same opportunities to learn as his or her peers. But if the child has been incorrectly diagnosed with one of those conditions, as a result of the similarities between visual perceptual difficulties and these impairments, or they have visual perceptual difficulties in addition to another impairment, the interventions being used may not be as effective as they could be. To help provide an optimal learning environment for not only children with visual perceptual difficulties, but for all children, the first step any teacher needs to take, is to look closely at their classroom environment and get a feel for how cluttered it actually is. To learn more about this common yet often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed condition, tune in for part two of this blog series on visual perceptual difficulties. If you've just learned that your child is visually impaired, you are probably trying to sort out how serious the problem is, where to get help, and what this means for your child's future. In many cases, visual impairments can be corrected. If your child's visual impairment is serious, give yourself time to adjust. One in 20 preschoolers and 1 in 4 school-age children have vision problems, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Glasses can usually improve it. If detected early, temporarily patching the normal eye may resolve the problem by forcing the brain to use the affected eye. Amblyopia, also know as \"lazy eye,\" occurs when vision in one eye is reduced. Cortical visual impairment (CVI). Not enough oxygen to the brain, brain injury, or infections such as encephalitis and meningitis can cause CVI. It can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment and blindness. If more severe, ROP can result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Genetically transmitted visual impairments. Infantile cataracts (a cloudy lens) and congenital glaucoma (a disorder that damages the optic nerve) often run in families. They can cause vision impairment. This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe. If your child's visual impairment is severe, he or she may need help from other specialists to develop life skills. Specialists in low-vision rehabilitation and mobility are trained to help visually impaired children adapt to their environment and develop independence. Today, there are also many low-vision devices and adaptive technologies that will help your child communicate, learn, and lead an independent life.

Prevent Blindness America: \"Signs of Possible Eye Problems in Children\" and \"Guidelines for Children's Vision Health.\" The Children's Nonverbal Learning Disabilities Scale (C-NLD) is an assessment that screens for the symptoms for nonverbal learning disabilities in children, which can affect a child's visual spatial organization, motor abilities, and social interactions. Predominant factors correlated with CBS are a decrease of visual acuity, visual field loss, and elderly age. The most commonly accepted theory for Charles Bonnet Syndrome proposes that extreme visual impairment promotes sensory deafferentation, leading to disinhibition, thus resulting in sudden neural firings of the visual cortical regions.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria\nTypes of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods,  (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. This mainly involves  Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis\n\nEarly diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This...spread across my leg as fast as a Star Trek space disease in time-lapse.\" He got the disease during a trip to Thailand.

It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described the necrotizing infection of the perineum and scrotum, now called Fournier gangrene. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This...spread across my leg as fast as a Star Trek space disease in time-lapse.\" He got the disease during a trip to Thailand.

How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis? Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Different types of bacterial infection can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious condition that is often associated with sepsis and widespread organ failure. Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs. Occasionally, mycotic (fungal) species cause necrotizing fasciitis. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a \"flesh eating\" or \"skin eating\" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or \"flesh-eating parasites\" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating bacterial infection or flesh-eating disease; suppurative fasciitis; dermal, Meleney, hospital, or Fournier's gangrene; and necrotizing cellulitis. Body regions frequently have the term necrotizing placed before them to describe the initial localization of necrotizing fasciitis (for example, necrotizing colitis, necrotizing arteriolitis), but they all refer to the same disease process in the tissue. Fortunately, this disease is relatively rare; various statistical sources estimate about 500 to 1,500 individuals are reported to have the disease per year in the U.S.\nStatistics show mortality (death) rates have been reported as high as 75% for necrotizing fasciitis associated with Fournier's (scrotal) gangrene, but the mortality in patients with the infection in other regions of the body (for example, legs or arms) is about 25%. Variations of necrotizing fasciitis are placed by some investigators into three general groups or types, roughly based on the type of organisms causing the infection and some clinical findings that vary from patient to patient. Type 1 is either caused by more than one bacterial genera (polymicrobial) or by the infrequently found single bacterial genus such as Vibrio vulnificus or fungal genera such as Candida. Type 2 is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, and type 3 (or termed type 3 gas gangrene) is caused by Clostridium bacteria. Many investigators elect not to use this typing system and simply identify the organism(s) causing the necrotizing fasciitis. Bacteria cause most cases of necrotizing fasciitis; only rarely do other organisms such as fungi cause this disease. Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, either alone or with other bacteria, cause many cases of necrotizing fasciitis, although Clostridium bacteria should be considered as a cause especially if gas is found in the infected tissue. Because of better microbial isolation techniques for anaerobic (grow in the absence of oxygen) bacteria, bacterial genera such as Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium are often cultured from the infected area. Frequently, culture of tissue involved by necrotizing fasciitis also yields a mixture of other aerobic (require oxygen to grow) bacterial types such as E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and others. Many investigators conclude that non-anaerobic organisms damage tissue areas enough to cause local areas of hypoxia (reduced oxygen) where anaerobic organisms then can thrive and extend the infection further. This results in polymicrobial infection in which one type of bacteria aids the survival and growth of another type of bacteria (synergy). Infrequently, Vibrio vulnificus causes the disease when a person, usually someone with liver function problems (for example, alcoholics or immunosuppressed patients), eats contaminated seafood or a wound gets contaminated with seawater containing Vibrio vulnificus. Other organisms may rarely cause necrotizing fasciitis, but when they do, the resulting infections are often difficult to treat successfully. For example, Aeromonas hydrophila (a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium) was the source of this disease in a 24-year-old who cut her thigh in a homemade zip line accident in the U.S. Although Aeromonas hydrophila is usually associated with warm brackish water and causes infections in fish and amphibians, gastroenteritis is the disease it causes most often in humans when the water sources are swallowed. Because it is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate if it infects human tissues. In addition, once it infects tissues, its enzymes and toxins allow a rapid entrance of the organisms to the bloodstream, causing sepsis and infection of other body organs. In general, the bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis utilize similar methods to cause and advance the disease. In polymicrobial infections, one bacterial genus may produce one toxic factor (for example, E. coli causing tissue hypoxia) while different types of coinfecting bacteria may produce other toxins that lyse (disintegrate) damaged tissue cells or connective tissue. In general, this disease is not contagious, but the organisms that may lead to its development are contagious, usually by direct contact between people or items that can transfer the bacteria. People usually need a break in their skin (cut, abrasion) for these flesh-eating bacteria to cause disease. Theoretically, anyone with an infection has a small risk of getting necrotizing fasciitis; the risk factors begin to increase if the infection occurs in immunosuppressed individuals (for example, diabetics, elderly, infants, those with liver disease, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as chemotherapy for cancer). Visible infections (skin, hair follicles, fingernails, visible trauma sites) are more likely to be noticed and treated than some deep infections. Patients who have any deep infections (muscle, bone, joint, gastrointestinal) are at somewhat higher risk for the disease because the initial infection and subsequent spread is usually not as noticeable as more visible infections. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis, but there is still controversy about the cause of this disease. Necrotizing fasciitis has interesting demographics; more males than females are affected (about three to one), and Vibrio vulnificus infections seem limited to coastal areas with warm water where the organisms are found associated with seafood and contaminated water. Some patients can become septic (meaning the infection has spread to the bloodstream and throughout the body) before the skin changes are recognized, especially when flesh-eating disease begins in deep facial planes. Necrotizing fasciitis type 1 often occurs after trauma or surgery and may form little or undetectable amounts of gas. Type 3 usually occurs after trauma or after wounds become contaminated with dirt that contains Clostridium bacteria, which produce gas in tissues (gangrene) and necrotic eschars. However, symptoms for types 1-3 are not definitive, and symptoms vary widely which is why some investigators prefer to define individual patients' disease by the organism(s) isolated from the patient rather than assigning a type label. One set of patients that is being recognized with a more specific set of symptoms and health history are those infected with Vibrio vulnificus. The organisms occur in the warmer waters in the U.S. (Gulf of Mexico and southern coastal states) and elsewhere in the world with similar water conditions. Either ingesting the organisms or getting Vibrio vulnificus from contaminated seawater into skin abrasions or cuts can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Even though a single type of bacteria causes this infection, some investigators classify it as a variant of type 1 necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis (also termed NEC; necrosis of gastrointestinal tissue) occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis. Although investigators suggest that bacterial infection causes this disease, there is no definitive data to prove this and others attribute the disease to a dysfunction of the intestinal tissue. Often a preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is based on the patient's symptoms, including the medical and exposure history as described above. For example, a diabetic patient with a rectal fistula who develops pain, swelling, and scrotal skin changes may be preliminarily diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene, while another diabetic patient with liver failure and skin changes (bullae) and exposure to seawater may be preliminarily diagnosed with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. For example, the stain can distinguish between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and further distinguish their shapes (coccus or round, rod, or comma-shaped like Vibrio). Organisms isolated from necrotizing fasciitis need to have studies done to determine antibiotic resistance, because many organisms causing the disease are multidrug resistant. Although X-rays occasionally show gas in tissues, investigators suggest doing Doppler ultrasound, CT, or MRI studies to help show gas in tissues and to help delineate the extent of the infection. Most physicians run additional tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts (elevated in necrotizing fasciitis), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), sodium (decreased in necrotizing fasciitis), and other tests to monitor the patient. For example, testicular involvement would require a urologic surgeon, while necrotizing fasciitis involving the leg may require general surgeon, a plastic surgeon for skin/scar repair, and for vaginal necrotizing fasciitis, an OB/GYN surgeon. The initial choice of antibiotics can be made based upon the types of flesh-eating bacteria suspected of causing the infection, but many doctors believe that multiple antibiotics should be used at the same time to protect the patient from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, or sometimes termed flesh-eating bacteria in the popular press), as well as infections with anaerobic bacteria, and polymicrobial infections. A surgeon needs to be consulted immediately if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected or preliminarily diagnosed. As is the case for immediate antimicrobial therapy, early surgical treatment of most cases of necrotizing fasciitis can reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients with extensive disease may take months of treatment especially if they need skin grafting and/or plastic surgery. Necrotizing fasciitis does not begin unless an infection has already started in tissue; immediate effective treatment of any infection is likely to prevent the disease. Further, anything that can help prevent infections will help prevent necrotizing fasciitis. Practices such as hand washing, checking extremities for cuts or wounds if you have diabetes, avoiding physical contact with people who carry MRSA, and good hygiene practices help prevent initial infections that may lead to flesh-eating disease. Immunosuppressed patients should be very careful not to get infections, and people with liver disease should avoid eating seafood that may be contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus. People with liver disease should not have any infections or cuts in the skin exposed to warm seawater to avoid necrotizing fasciitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus. Cases of necrotizing fasciitis may occur when surgical sites become infected. Consequently, physicians need to use sterile techniques when doing surgery and adhere to hospital practices such as glove and gown coverage to help prevent infection spread in hospitalized patients. Careful surgical techniques in sites that can easily become contaminated are required. Some examples of such sites are bowel surgery, episiotomy (surgically enlarging the vaginal outlet), and debridement with closure of traumatic wounds. Necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious. However, it is possible for uninfected people to physically come into contact with some patients with the disease and become infected with an organism that may eventually cause necrotizing fasciitis. For example, a person could come in contact with a lesion containing MRSA organisms causing or contributing to the disease in another person and then become infected with MRSA. Transmission from one person to another usually requires direct contact with a patient or some item that can transfer organisms like MRSA to another person's skin; infection usually requires a skin break (cut or abrasion) for the organisms to establish an infection (cross-contamination of infected wounds). Combined mortality and morbidity (for example, limb loss, scar formation, renal (kidney) failure, and sepsis) for all cases of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported as 70%-80%. Cases of Fournier's gangrene have reported as high as 75% mortality rates, while cases of Vibrio vulnificus-associated necrotizing fasciitis have about a 50% mortality rate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007, made Vibrio vulnificus infection a reportable disease so the statistics on the incidence (frequency of occurrence) should be more easily obtained in the future. The worst complication of this disease is rapid advancement that results in death. \"Emergent Management of Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections.\" \"Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria).\" WebMD.com. <https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-bacteria-topic-overview>. \"Necrotizing Fasciitis.\" <http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/>.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture. The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery…ect [sic]…may have already damaged you. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. In 2008, the U.S. FDA added black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with \"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects\" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available. More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of \"black box\" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, \n\n overwhelmingly recommended stronger label warnings on the containers because of rare but sometimes devastating side effects. On 12 May 2016, the FDA issued a drug safety communication advising that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for these conditions only when no other options are available due to potentially permanent, disabling side effects occurring together. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and the FDA first added a black-box warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only. She supported making birth control available to women over the counter. jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including \"risks\" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy. Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, \n\n Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, \n\nAbortion in Wisconsin is legal up to the 22nd week of pregnancy. 53% of adults said in a poll by the Pew Research Center that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is also an anti-abortion community, much of it centered on religious groups. There has been some anti-abortion violence, including a bomb attack against a Planned Parenthood clinic in April 2012. Terminology \n\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"induced abortion\" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons. Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context \nFree birth control correlates to teenage girls having a fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. A 2014 New England Journal of Medicine study found such a link. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states have legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. History\n\nLegislative history \n\nIn 1849, the state legislature passed a law that criminalized abortion, making it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman, no matter the circumstances of her pregnancy. The state was one of 23 states in 2007 to have a detailed abortion-specific informed consent requirement. In 2012, Governor Walker and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Healthy Youth Act, which required schools to provide students scientifically-accurate and age-appropriate information on contraception as one method to help prevent STIs and unplanned births. However, this was replaced with a requirement for abstinence-only education, in which schools are to teach that \"abstinence is the only reliable way to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted infections.\" Specifically, requirements under this law require that students are taught the benefits of and reasons for abstinence, as well as the \"positive connection between marriage and parenting.\" In mid-May 2019, state law banned abortion after week 22. Specifically, the legislature passed a measure requiring abortion physicians to provide information on abortion reversal – a procedure that the scientific community sees as illegitimate and invalid, as it is not based upon medically-sound research. In addition, the legislature passed a bill that would eliminate all government funding for Planned Parenthood, as well as a ban on all abortions based upon the race, sex, or genetic anomaly of the fetus. Evers also vetoed a bill that would sentence doctors to life in prison for failing to provide infants with medical care if they are born alive during a botched abortion attempt. Admitting privileges require physicians providing abortion to obtain the right to admit patients at local hospitals – although federal law dictates that no hospital can deny a patient admittance. The state's primary argument in defense of the admitting privileges requirement centers on women's health. Specifically, if complications arise, this requirement presumes a continuity of care for the patient. The court's ruling, however, determined that the remarkably low rates of complications associated with abortion, and the state's failure to impose similar requirements on physicians providing riskier procedures rendered these claims moot. In 2001, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin did not provide any residence related data regarding abortions performed in the state to the Centers for Disease Control.

The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is a strain of coronavirus that leads to the respiratory illness known as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is highly contagious in humans. It is considered the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. It is important to note that the virus has the potential to mutate, and some variants have shown increased infectivity. However, with the emergence of variants, the transmissibility of the virus can vary. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread globally. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Phylogenetics and taxonomy\n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families) Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses. A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. 3,422 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus. In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins. Phylogenetic tree\n\nVariants \n\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\n Alpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Virology\n\nStructure\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is  in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 1.0 kg. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion. Genome \nSARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long. Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides, like other coronaviruses. The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS–related coronaviruses. By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2. Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus. Treatment and drug development \nVery few drugs are known to effectively inhibit SARS‑CoV‑2. However, it is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans as of August 2021. COVID Moonshot is an international collaborative open-science project started in March 2020 with the goal of developing an un-patented oral antiviral drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number () of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44. This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015. Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor.

The low-grade breast implants produced by the now closed French manufacture Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were made available in nearly all member states with the largest concentration in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. The implants - containing silicone made for use in mattresses - were banned in 2010 but France caused waves in December last year when it issued a cancer alert and advised French women to have the implants removed. The report found that “data available today was insufficient to lead to firm conclusions regarding the health risks for women with PIP silicone breast implants”. The evidence of health risks for women with PIP silicon breast implants, it concluded, is weak. But proven fraud, possible sub-standard screening processes in Europe, and recent revelations that the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) banned the company in 2000 are causing concern among MEPs in the European parliament. PIP obtained a permit for its saline implants in 1997 from the German certification company, TUV Rheinland. The manufacturer declared a medical-grade silicone but instead used an industrial alternative that is around ten times less expensive saving the company around €1.2 million per year, according to Reuters. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and then banned PIP saline implants in the United States in 2000 after inspecting the manufacturer’s premises in southern France. The FDA agent who inspected the site in 2000 said the implants had been “adulterated”, according to press reports. The same plant in southern France was manufacturing the silicone implants generating the current uproar. Authorities are unable to determine which people received which implants. In Denmark, one clinic closed and destroyed all its documents once it was discovered that it had used some PIP implants. The women treated at the clinic have no idea if they are carrying anyone of the implants classified as potentially dangerous. McAvan is now pushing for a EU-wide system that improves traceability of the implants and wants the commission to implement an EU-level barcode that identifies every item. Euro-MPs are pressing for a ban on breast implants for under-18 year olds as part of an EU-wide campaign for tougher health and safety regulations on silicone gel products. The European Commission has promised to re-write EU legislation on medical devices to avoid a repeat of the breast implant scandal involving French-firm Poly Implant Prothese which emerged last year. After recent implant scandals, revised EU legislation should make medical devices subject to more stringent tests, but health ministers are dragging their feet. Despite reassurance surrounding the controversial breast implants at the centre of a global health scare, fear is continuing to spread. Israel”s Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. The decision was prompted by the French Government”s announcement that it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, to have them removed. Theyhave a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from arare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. Ithas also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coatingdesigned to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Up to now, there have been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in recent weeks. Shesaid ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from theNetherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Maltaand Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. as a part of the breast reconstruction process or used cosmetically to augment small breasts. An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat. This study investigated whether breast implants are associated with abnormal ECG recordings. The boss of the French company which distributed the defective breast implants was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud. And despite reports and conjectures showing adverse health impacts of breast implants, there are still women who consider having breast implants,\" the bill's authors noted. There have been roughly 60 cases of ALCL in women with breast implants worldwide, according to the FDA. According to a Dubai-based plastic surgeon, breast implants procedures are much in demand in the UAE. If you have developed problems with your breast implants, or your breast implant surgery has gone wrong, you could be entitled to compensation. PIP implants refer to a type of silicone based breast implant manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). PIP breast implants were banned in the UK in March 2010 by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

There is also debate about the role of zinc in increasing testosterone levels. It is important to approach the use of these popular supplements with caution and consult with a healthcare professional before starting any testosterone-enhancing regimen. ** This is a popular ingredient in testosterone-enhancing supplements, and there's some research to suggest it can increase testosterone by itself or when combined with other supplements, but the research has not been consistent. \"Experts\" claim fenugreek works by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen.

It is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and bloodstream infections. Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups. To conclude, Neisseria meningitidis is indeed a significant cause of meningitis, especially in children. In infants, symptoms may include fever, irritability, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanel (soft spot on the head). In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care. In Russia, 13 children had been treated (5 with intensive care) by mid-June for a multisystem inflammatory syndrome at the Morozov Children's Hospital in Moscow, including a 2-year-old girl with the COVID-19 infection who died on 23 May following an initial diagnosis of suspected Kawasaki disease. In India, a \n\n Haemophilus meningitis is a form of bacterial meningitis caused by the Haemophilus influenzae bacteria. It is usually (but not always) associated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Meningitis involves the inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Haemophilus meningitis is characterized by symptoms including fever, nausea, sensitivity to light, headaches, stiff neck, anorexia, and seizures. Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal, although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent, mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medically reviewed by University of Illinois-Chicago, College of Medicine on September 21, 2016 — Written by Jeannette Belliveau. nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis and given Lyrica. I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gout are two forms of inflammatory arthritis. Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation Yes. Unfortunately, rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes difficult to detect and diagnose because the symptoms vary from person to person and there is no one definitive test for the disease. Nine out of ten or 90% of people with RA test positive for ACPA and the test is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of arthritis. Similar to RF, a patient may test positive for ACPA even before the signs and symptoms of … Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. Lab tests aren’t perfect—you can test … Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the immune system that is designed to protect the body by attacking foreign substances like viruses or bacteria. The normal action of the immune system is affected when the autoimmune disease mistakenly attacks the joints. Medical tests for psoriatic arthritis #5: Rheumatoid factor (RF) Rheumatoid factor is a protein antibody produced by the immune system that attacks healthy tissue. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome have positive RF tests. The higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. These tests are used to detect specific antibodies, genetic and immune factors, and certain markers (substances that may Rheumatoid arthritis The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is usually among the last joints involved. Aug 31, 2009 · This test may be useful for monitoring patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, etc.3 However, this is not diagnostic and may rise in other conditions like infections, malignancy, anaemia and some other diseases. An autoantibody is an antibody that is directed against an organism’s own tissues (like in autoimmune diseases). In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, 4 out of 5 people will have RF detectable in their blood. A blood test that measures citrullinated proteins (CPs) could lead to osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses years before the physical symptoms manifest in patients, according to a recent study. Blood Test Aids Early Detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis A blood test that measures the levels of a certain protein can be used in conjunction with clinical assessments to assist with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is now available in North America. Learn more about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by taking the symptoms quiz. This quiz is intended for patients who have been diagnosed with RA. Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests are frequently used to help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also to assess any potential problems with the various drugs that are used to treat RA. All tests DNA Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis. This test cannot be ordered as an individual test but only as a part of the list of diseases included in our Genetic Predisposition Test panel. A blood test is used to detect the presence of rheumatoid factor. The blood test is commonly ordered to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic performance of a point of care test (POCT) for detection of anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with 2 years of disease duration or less. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis involves a series of lab tests and a physical evaluation of symptoms. Testing blood for rheumatoid factor is a common way to help diagnose the disease, however some patients may test negative while arthritic symptoms persist. This support surprisingly comes from a study showing that antibiotics were not helpful for treating symptoms of the more common “wear and tear” arthritis (called osteoarthritis)1. Elevated levels can indicate muscle inflammation and other muscle problems. A combination of drugs is the cornerstone of treatment. Blood test that could predict arthritis risk. Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test : Principle, Procedure, Interpretation and Clinical Significance. The IsolateFibromyalgia test reportedly provides a highly accurate diagnosis that differentiates fibromyalgia from conditions that it mimics or conditions that would be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme disease, and lupus. Approximately 88% of people with Ankylosing Spokdylitis test positive for HLA B27. It is important to note that positive HLA B27 results by themselves should not be considered definitive. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate)—This blood test is used to detect inflammation in the body. Higher sed rates indicate the presence of inflammation and are typical of many forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and many of the connective tissue diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the synovium. This leads to an inflammatory immune response that causes pain, joint deformity and disability as it progresses (). Test limitations: Eight percent of Caucasians have a positive HLA-B27, while far less than one percent actually develop arthritis. Can a dexa scan detect arthritis . Suggest treatment for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . In order to facilitate the detection of ACPA in clinical practice, our scientists here at ORGENTEC Diagnostika have used mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) to develop a very effective rapid test for point of care testing (POCT) upon suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis. Sensitive Test Enables Early Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It an effective tool for the rapid and precise routine diagnosis of suspected RA and the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis and the Lung. Authored by Dr Colin Tidy, It is usually associated with severe arthritis and high serum levels of rheumatoid factor. Blood tests for evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, including serology. Respiratory function tests, including spirometry. Your doctor will perform physical examination, evaluate your medical history, order some blood tests (i.e. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, rheumatoid factor or RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-CCP antibodies) in order to confirm the diagnosis. A test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP), substances made in the blood of children with some forms of JIA. Ancillary tests to detect rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A special blood test can help identify the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Other tests (blood tests, MRI or CT scans) may be performed if there are red flags, or to confirm or exclude the presence other rare conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a spinal tumor, infection, fracture, or other types of arthritis. The cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disease (an illness that occurs when the body mistakenly detects its own tissue as foreign and attacks itself). A reliable new blood test can test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) years in advance. With about 1.5 million Americans suffering from the debilitating condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), early detection is key. HealthTap: Doctor answers on Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and More: Dr. Singh on signs of autoimmune diseases with negative blood tests: Routine blood tests do not examine for HIV and may not detect any abnormality due to HIV at two years after exposure. “We have developed a test for measuring the underlying autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis patients that should be used to evaluate new treatment regimens,” says senior author Dr. Gregg Silverman, professor in the Departments of Medicine and Pathology at NYU Langone and co-director of its Musculoskeletal Center of Excellence. Blood Test. A special kind of blood test known as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is carried out to diagnose sarcoid arthritis.. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better \n\nSATURDAY, Oct. 26, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Drugs that people with rheumatoid arthritis use to help ease the symptoms of the disease might also help ward off heart trouble, two new studies find. Researchers in Sweden found that so-called \"biologic\" drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or anti-TNFs, slightly reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome -- a condition that includes angina and heart attack in which blood supply to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. In another study, British scientists also found taking these drugs was associated with a lower risk for heart attack in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. The roughly 1.3 million Americans affected by the rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack the joints, often suffer from pain, stiffness, swelling, and have trouble moving and using many of their joints. \"It has been known that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a greater risk of developing heart disease than those without,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. \"This risk seems to extend in many forms of cardiovascular disorders, among which the most notable is coronary artery disease, but also includes heart failure, peripheral artery disease and possibly stroke.\" In the first study, the Swedish team compared rates of heart disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking anti-TNFs with patients not using the drugs and people in the general population, to see if the medications could also cut the risk for heart issues. The study involved a group of more than 7,700 patients in Sweden with rheumatoid arthritis who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. The study revealed the prevalence of heart events was slightly lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were actively taking anti-TNFs than people with rheumatoid arthritis who had never taken this type of medication. After taking other factors into account, such as how long the patients had rheumatoid arthritis, other diseases affecting the patients and socio-economic status, the researchers found that patients actively on the drugs had a 27 percent lower risk for angina/heart attack than patients who had never taken such a drug. \"This nationwide study adds to the evidence that use of TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis also has an impact on cardiovascular [illness],\" study author Dr. Lotta Ljung, a senior consultant in rheumatology at Umea University Hospital, said in a news release issued by the meeting organizers. They also considered whether the severity of heart attacks was in any way affected by treatment with TNF inhibitors. One examined the safety of biologic drugs, the other examined heart attack-related hospitalizations in England and Wales. \"Better control of inflammation with biologic therapy might reduce not only the rate of heart attacks, but potentially also affect the size of [heart attacks],\" reasoned study co-author Dr. William Dixon a rheumatologist with Arthritis Research UK's Epidemiology Unit at the University of Manchester. The study showed that patients taking anti-TNF drugs were at lower risk for heart attack than patients taking traditional DMARDs. However, use of the biologic drugs did not affect the severity of heart attacks, the British team found. His team pointed out, however, that patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally have an increased risk of heart attacks. So, even though anti-TNFs may help curb the risk for heart attacks they do not eliminate it. The U.K. group conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who taking biologic drugs still need to take steps to cut their risk for heart disease. \"Given that these studies demonstrate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis, patients should try to mitigate other known cardiovascular risk factors by not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet and weight,\" said Dr. Diane Horowitz, a rheumatologist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\nFor his part, Ong said it makes \"sense that drugs that reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis could reduce some of the risk of developing heart disease in these same patients.\" The U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides more information on rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On March 26, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases. On April 11, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths. The HHS Inspector General released a report in April of its survey of 323 hospitals in late March; reporting severe shortages of test supplies and extended waits for results, widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. May to August 2020\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 22, the U.S. passed 25million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. Hospital care crisis\n\nVaccination campaign\n\nEffectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nTimeline graph of doses administered\n\nBackground to various vaccines\n\nVaccine mandates\n\nBy August 2021, more than 800 colleges and universities, over 200 health care companies and dozens of states, local governments and school districts, had some type of vaccination requirements. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 22, the U.S. passed 25million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites.

Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment option for managing chronic eye inflammation. Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. Clearside Biomedical announced that their proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA) improved vision in patients with macular edema from noninfectious uveitis. pSivida announced in a press release that their injectable corticosteroid insert (Durasert) met its primary efficacy endpoint in a second phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of posterior uveitis. Clearside Biomedical is enrolling participants in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Santen is moving forward with a new drug application for sirolimus intravitreal injection (Opsiria) for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis, despite mixed results from their phase 3 trial, Sakura Study 2. A phase 3 trial shows the investigational drug sarilumab is superior to adalimumab (Humira) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. One-year data from a phase 3 trial for pSivida’s sustained-release corticosteroid implant (Medidur) shows it is highly effective in preventing recurrence of posterior uveitis. The FDA has approved the first non-corticosteroid therapy for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) this week recommended that adalimumab (Humira) be approved for treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. Clearside Biomedical announced that a special formulation of triamcinolone acetonide showed good outcomes in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, helps prevent recurrence of posterior uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, may more effectively reduce recurrence and restore vision compared to standard therapy. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has signed a licensing agreement with EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a potential alternative to eye drops and injections for anterior uveitis. Early clinical trial results show that uveitis patients treated with a single suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide experienced improved vision and no meaningful increase in IOP. Akorn, Inc., confirmed that it has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to produce a generic version of Alcon’s topical corticosteroid, Durezol. Santen Inc. reports that a global phase 3 study analyzing the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of sirolimus for noninfectious posterior segment uveitis has met its primary endpoint. WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. Uveitis -- a term used to describe a group of inflammatory diseases inside the eye -- can cause loss of vision and potentially lead to blindness, Jaffe explained. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said. The reference medicine for Hefiya is Humira. After training, patients or their carers may inject Hefiya if their doctor considers it appropriate. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases. In addition Hefiya was as effective as Humira in a study involving 465 patients with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. The proportion of patients who had at least a 75% reduction in symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment was 68% with Hefiya and 63% with Humira. Because Hefiya is a biosimilar medicine, the studies on effectiveness and safety of adalimumab carried out with Humira do not all need to be repeated for Hefiya. What are the risks associated with Hefiya? The European Medicines Agency decided that, in accordance with EU requirements for biosimilar medicines, Hefiya has a highly similar structure, purity and biological activity to Humira and is distributed in the body in the same way. In addition, a study in psoriasis has shown that the effects of the medicine are equivalent to those of Humira in this condition. As for all medicines, data on the use of Hefiya are continuously monitored.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The Africa CDC will dispatch a team on Wednesday to the DRC to assess the situation and the level of support required to ongoing efforts by DRC and other partners to contain the outbreak, said John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC, during a press briefing on Tuesday at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms. It was tested in Guinea in 2015. Bikoro Health Zone reported the highest number of cases (n=31), followed by Iboko (n=8) and Mbandaka (n=2) Health Zones. WHO is working with Congo's government and other global organizations, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, to strengthen coordination to fight and contain the Ebola outbreak. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo—a city of 1 million residents with an international airport—or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. After confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC. The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC. Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the \n\n and by no means a global threat\" and declared it as a PHEIC, without restrictions on trade or travel.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The rate is particularly high for some conditions – in the case of fetuses diagnosed with single ventricle defects (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the most severe form of CHD), roughly 85% of pregnancies ended in abortion. Denmark began offering universal prenatal screening free of charge in 2004, and is already known to have a very high abortion rate for babies with Down’s syndrome. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Back in the first half of the 20th century, they were not pushing women to have abortions, but they were sterilizing people — which is still evil. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the jihad. They say they are against racism, so as to get you to follow them as they advance racism. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing. Cosmetics has worked with Planned Parenthood since 2008 and contributed over $2 million to the organization. According to John Demsey, executive group president of the brand’s parent company Estée Lauder, “It is so important for people of all ages, all races and all genders to get the accurate information and care they need so they can live their best, healthiest lives, but we see that a lot of people aren’t seeking that information and care because of stigmas that disproportionately affect women, people of color and the LGBTQ community .”\n\nLess than one percent of women getting a medication-induced abortion at Planned Parenthood had a serious side effect or a failed abortion, according to a new study. “At Planned Parenthood, medical abortion is extremely safe,” said reproductive health researcher James Trussell from Princeton University in New Jersey, who worked on the study. One limitation, the study team noted, is that not all women checked back after the abortion or had follow up medical records available - so it’s possible more complications could have occurred that weren’t recorded. Planned Parenthood staff members were required to make three attempts to reach any patients who didn’t return for follow up visits under the organization’s medical standards and guidelines. “We assume that if anything had happened, that people would get back in touch with Planned Parenthood,” Trussell told Reuters Health. Two of the study’s authors are Planned Parenthood employees, and Trussell is a member of the National Medical Committee of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The medication regimen used by Planned Parenthood - and many other abortion providers - is slightly different than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug course because it includes lower doses of mifepristone and at-home use of misoprostol. Medical abortions done at Planned Parenthood run for about $300 to $800, according to its website. “Mandating the FDA-approved regimen, without a scientific basis, does not protect patients from unsafe abortion; it only limits access to safe and effective medical abortion for women desiring a pregnancy termination,” they concluded. The story made national headlines. \"They had been confronted with a heartbreaking situation,\" she said in a formal statement. \"They carefully evaluated the patient’s situation and correctly applied the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services to it, saving the only life that was possible\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the United States as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. Concerns about long-term safety recurred with the report of a possible association between prostate cancer and vasectomy (309). It is extremely likely that normal couples will experience at least one unwanted pregnancy at some time during their reproductive years. As a result, abortion is common. About half of induced abortions are illegal and considered “unsafe” by the World Health Organization definition: procedures carried out either by an unskilled person or in unsafe conditions or both (313,314). As shown in Table 10.9 total abortion rates are quite similar over much of the world. What differs is the rate of safe abortions compared with unsafe abortions. In the developed countries, unsafe abortions are rare. per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

He attributes this position to the death of two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and in July 2006 voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports embryonic stem cell research. He voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo. Coleman opposes recognition of same-sex marriages by either the federal or state governments. In his 2002 Senate campaign he pledged support for an amendment to the United States Constitution that \n\n Ojeda self-identifies as pro-life but also stated he supports abortion rights and that he would only nominate judges who likewise shared his support for abortion. In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \"I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life.\" He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, \"a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child\". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \"pro-life, with exceptions\". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”\n\n Harry Reid was anti-abortion and former President Jimmy Carter has expressed his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro-life, while former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi favor abortion rights. Groups such as Democrats for Life of America represent the anti-abortion faction of the party while groups such as EMILY's List represent the abortion rights faction. A Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were anti-abortion while a 69% majority was in favor of abortion rights. According to the 2020 Democratic Party platform, \"Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\" The state has seen anti-abortion rights violence, including the kidnapping of a doctor in 1982 and the killing of Doctor George Tiller in 2009. Pro-life advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The terms \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context \n\nFree birth control correlates to teenage girls having fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states with legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. Some states, including Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings. The bill was known as House Bill 2324, \"An act prohibiting an abortion of an unborn human individual with a detectable fetal heartbeat.\" Kansas lawmakers approved sweeping anti-abortion legislation (HB 2253) on April 6, 2013, that says life begins at fertilization, forbids abortion based on gender and bans Planned Parenthood from providing sex education in schools. In April 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and ruled that the right to abortion is inherent within the state's constitution and bill of rights, such that even if Roe v.

At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. The device is an adaptation of early “heart-lung machines;” among the first iterations was a model created in the 1920s by research with canines. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Like many pediatric cardiologists, Lincoln’s surgeons faced challenges that make their success all the more remarkable: the seven-month-old went into cardiac arrest as they waited for the donor organ needed for his transplant—which necessitated an emergency surgery to compress his heart. This, followed by the transplantation, is especially tough on the tiny body of an infant patient. It’s not easy for family members in the waiting room, either. All over the world, scientists and researchers rely on animal models to discover more about how to detect and treat congenital heart defects—offering infants like Lincoln, and Kimmel’s son, a second chance at life. The innovations in medical devices and surgical techniques that result from this work have enabled healthcare providers to perform magic, one baby’s beating heart at a time. first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. Most people with heart failure do not need surgery and will be treated with drugs. Heart surgery is only done when doctors think it will improve a problem with the heart valves or the blood supply of the heart, and if the heart is strong enough. In most cases surgery cannot cure heart failure. Surgery that can be used to improve heart failure includes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgery and heart transplantation (see also ‘Medical devices for heart failure' and 'heart transplants for heart failure'). Another woman who had avoided seeing doctors about her heart for many years was given a new mitral valve and said the operation changed her life. She persuaded her surgeon to operate on her and felt her quality of life improved. She describes how wonderful she felt after her mitral valve was replaced. And just a good job that he was here because I collapsed and got rushed into hospital, spent 7 weeks in there because, you know, having 5 operations is a bit dicey as you can well imagine. And I finally got admitted to hospital in London and the surgeon there looked at my notes and he said, 'Definitely not, you've had far too many operations'. And I said to him 'oh dear' and he said, 'You surely don't want me to operate on you?' The last one, the surgeon fitted an artificial, a metal valve, a Starr-Edwards valve it's called. And this was the surgeon who'd had to have time to think about whether he was going to operate? Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG, pronounced \"cabbage\") is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. This new blood vessel is known as a graft (for more on CABG see Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery on our Heart Attack website). People can have CABG surgery following a heart attack, several months later, or following tests results such as an angiogram. Sab avoided a heart attack just because during a consultation for a lung condition he told the consultant about his chest pain. It showed that his artery was so bad that it would be dangerous to put a stent in and doctors decided to do a triple bypass instead. One man described how he felt when he was told during his angiogram that he would need bypass surgery immediately. Tests showed he needed bypass surgery. He felt devastated when he was told that he needed bypass surgery one week after his heart attack. So we went to see the my own specialist, the chest was fine, I had a bronchiectasis and he was saying that we now those tablet's working and I don't need to see you for another year which I was very pleased. My wife jumped in and said, \"Tell him about the pain you had,\" and he sort of looked at me and said, \"What pain?\" But then when you're taken to [the specialist hospital] and you actually see on the screen the effects of what's going on and then somebody says, 'we're requesting surgical intervention immediately,' it is a shock of some magnitude. The nurse then that was on the ward, she was just terrific. One man reported how the surgeon described the operation to him before he asked him to sign the consent form for bypass surgery. Her doctors disagreed about whether she should have bypass surgery at her age. He felt well informed before he signed the consent form for bypass surgery two weeks after his heart attack. He asked the surgeon how many bypass operations he had done before he consented to surgery. Is this another heart attack? I ended up in intensive care and then I ended up being taken to [the specialist] hospital where the same thing happened again. You're too old to be operated on. So they were getting me ready in the morning, had my breakfast, got up, went to the bathroom and had another heart attack. And I was taken down to the operating theatre and operated on and it was a success. You see I could quite understand they don't want to lose a patient, it's not good for them to lose a patient and if the chances are 50/50, I think they'd rather take their 50 on their side and have you die at home than on their table. The surgeon, I think he was a very good communicator. After the operation he came back and he explained everything he had done. And he explained that progressively they was going to remove all the different pipes, and the purpose for them and everything else, and I thought it was marvellous that a surgeon would take the time out to explain everything he was going to do, or had done, in the next few days. And I was very, very impressed with this surgeon, I've got to be truthful. So the only person that was really good, as far as I was concerned, was the surgeon and he didn't mince his words, you know, he spat it straight out. I knew the risk from living and dying on the operation or from a stroke and everything else and that's the way I like it, I knew exactly where I stood. I'm telling you this because one of the things that the surgeon told us was that the, one of the things that I wanted to know from the surgeon was how many of these things had he done. Was he, sort of, did he know what he was doing and he told me, this was September, he told me by that time he had done about 140 bypass operations that year. And I also asked him what the prognosis was and he told me that 95% of all cases of, who have bypass surgery are successful, and 5% are not. He said mostly what can go wrong is that you get some kind of sepsis and we can fix that. So I thought the odds were pretty good, bearing in mind that my cardiologist said I've got to have this done, not much choice. Some people felt they wanted to have surgery; for instance a man who had CABG surgery because doctors thought it would prevent sudden death, said that he wanted to feel everything was being done that could be done (for more information see 'Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome' Information sheet from the British Heart Foundation January 2013). He had bypass surgery to reduce his chances of sudden death. I think my family were keen though that I had the surgery and it was important to me that everything was being demonstrated to be done that could be done. So I had the surgery, and then I hit the problems that nurses and doctors get when they're in the hands of their colleagues. Sometimes people had expected tests to lead to some kind of surgery and felt slightly disappointed to learn that surgery would not help them. In Brian’s case an angiogram revealed that his heart would no longer be able to cope with surgery. It took him some time to realise that surgery wouldn't help his heart failure. Brian explains why he didn’t have any more surgery after his pacemaker was fitted. Well, the, the pacemaker was fitted in eight years ago, so, so that was minor surgery and it was in 2005 which is six years ago that I had , I believe it’s called an angiogram but the; I had a number of tubes shoved up from my groin into my heart. I had no symptoms of a problem prior to that but, but it is believed that, that, the poor fitting of the two valves resulted in the heart having to work harder and this resulted in the left ventricle weakening and so the decision was taken that heart surgery would not help me and therefore the only invasion of my body that I’ve had [laughs] is a pacemaker and an angiogram but I’ve had no other surgery. When surgery had led to further complications and people had to stay in hospital longer than expected they said their families often felt under strain. Several said that they were disappointed not to recover from bypass surgery as fast as others around them; one man said that he had expected his bypass to make his heart better but was told afterwards that it was more damaged than he had thought. His by-pass surgery didn't make him feel any better. I get slightly annoyed, though I'm happy for other people who get bypass surgery and feel wonderful afterwards, I think it was just, I was just treated under the assumption that I've had the surgery and I was gonna be fully fit, fully operative and so interestingly at that point stopped, because that was supposed to be corrective. The medicine that I'm on, the treatment with medicine, is not going to cure, it will prevent hopefully, any further damage, or will slow down further damage, it won't cure it, and I'm all right with that, because I could be an awful lot worse off than what I am, and it has been explained to me, by the powers that be, that if it does get worse, what the position is gonna be. 'when the surgeon cut me open he would have said 'What the hell have we got here? However, some people need more than one bypass and so it may take longer depending on how many blood vessels are being grafted (NHS Choices, April 2012). Sab talks about how he felt and looked like following his CABG surgery. I was still under Intensive Care so and then one; I had, the one thing that really was irritating, I had an oxygen in my nose and making… the mask I had with wire… loads of wire from here, here – chest and you don't do nothing, you just lie there, you're almost as good as dead. But the support from nurses and the people in charge, it was so brilliant, they were there to make sure that, reassure you that you are alright. Recovering from surgery could take time. Sometimes surgery did not go as well as planned and several people had experienced pain; one man said it had taken 2 years to get the original surgery corrected. He describes the pain he felt after his first operation and how he needed to have the bones in his chest re-aligned. In 1993 when I had the operation you know they opened the chest okay, when they put it back they didn't put it back straight, the ribs weren't like this, they were not in line they were like this. And I saw other patients with you know who had similar operations and they recovered, twenty days after the operation they're fine, six months later everything is forgotten and it's gone. The nurse before the operation said \"What do you think about this, this, this?\" So I signed the form, went to the operation and they aligned the, re-aligned the bones together. It takes most people several months to recover after the operation. Sab talks about what he was able to do at the various stages of his recovery.

This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. The injections are given directly into the area of the spine affected. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. Some may, therefore, require surgery, with some requiring the disc to be removed. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. A study conducted by Alessandro Napoli and his team at Sapienza University in Rome investigated the use of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) as a treatment for back pain resulting from lumbar disk herniation. The study included 128 patients who had not responded to conservative treatment for their back pain. These patients underwent CT-guided pRF, which delivers energy pulses to the root of the nerve for 10 minutes. In comparison, another group of 120 participants received CT-guided steroid injections without pRF. Patients who received pulsed radiofrequency reported improvements in pain and disability scores. They also experienced quicker relief from leg pain and perceived faster recovery times. Based on these results, the researchers suggest offering pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disks and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy. This can be an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments, such as surgery or corticosteroid injections. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment is relatively non-invasive, only lasting 10 minutes, and a single session was sufficient for many patients in the study. In summary, the study on CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency as a treatment for back pain from lumbar disk herniation demonstrated favorable outcomes, including improved pain and disability scores, faster leg pain relief, and quicker perceived recovery times. This approach may offer benefits to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments and could potentially help them avoid invasive surgery or corticosteroid injections. The comparative study comparing the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain found that both CRF and PRF were effective in relieving pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. The main advantages of RF seem to be its effectiveness and high pain relief rate without the dangerous complications of surgical procedures  and lack of secondary effects and reduction of oral medication . Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk for recurrence but a higher risk for complications requiring hospitalization . The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus PRF in the treatment of ITN pain. All procedures were performed in the operating room. After the stimulation period, the patient was given 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1–2 mg/kg propofol. Trial stimulation:First, sensory stimulation at 100 Hz was performed with 0.1–0.5 V to search for a tingling sensation at the affected branch, which is the trigeminal nerve branch innervating the trigger zone. We continued to lesion in 5°C increments for 60 s until we reached a maximum of 80°C for 60 s. At each stage, the patient was allowed to recover from the intravenous propofol, and we tested for reduction of response to pinprick stimulation. In the PRF group, a PRF current at a dose of 500 pulses was given to the affected branch, and then we tested the affected area for severity of pain. If the pain was still present, we gave another pulsed dose, and then we examined for pain relief until we covered beyond the trigger area and did not exceed a temperature of 42°C. Patients were evaluated as regards their pain intensity using VAS, patient satisfaction using Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS), the need for additional pharmacological treatment, side effects, complications, and the need for repeating the use of RF treatment. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the presence of complications on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF on the first day, at first week, at first month, and at 3 months after treatment. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF at 6 months after treatment [Table 3]. Pain recurrence after one or more surgical operations is also frequently seen. Surgical and interventional procedures include glycerol injection, percutaneous balloon microdecompression, rhizotomy, thermocoagulation with RF, microvascular decompression, and gamma knife radiosurgery, all of which may be necessary when other treatments fail, but have different surgical risks . As regards pain relief, there was a significant improvement in VAS in both groups throughout the follow-up period; follow-up was scheduled on the first day, at first week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. stated that thermocoagulation offers the highest rates of complete pain relief; this is in agreement with the present study, as we found a highly significant difference in VAS scores at different time points of follow-up compared with pretreatment results. This is nearly the same with respect to patient satisfaction in the present study, as patients were satisfied in both groups until the 6 months Less satisfaction was observed in the PRF group; this may be due to the temporary effects of PRF on the nerve rather than the permanent changes caused by CRF. On comparing the studied groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. We needed repetition of the procedure for 12 patients in the PRF group after 6 months of follow-up; Fraioli and colleagues repeated the procedure in 10 patients. This is different from our results as there were statistical differences between the two groups at 6 months, which may be due to the use of PRF for 10 min and in a pulsed manner for 2 min only. The VAS scores decreased in only two of 20 patients from the PRF group (group 2) and these two patients had achieved considerable pain relief after the procedure. The pain relief lasted 3 months and pain recurrence occurred after 3 months of the procedure. Overall, there was greater satisfaction in the CRF group compared with the PRF group at 6-month follow-up, but without statistical significance. Supervisor of the study decided to perform CRF in group 2, because they still had pain. In present study, we found that there was a need for repetition of the procedure after 6 months for only two patients in the CRF group and 12 patients in the PRF group, which showed high statistical difference between the two groups. The results of Erdine and colleagues are in agreement with our results as no complications were observed in the intraoperative period or in the early postoperative period. After the procedures, as a side effect, five of 20 patients from group 1 and three of 20 patients from group 2 reported moderate headache for 24 h. In all patients from group 1, there was mild hypoesthesia and parasthesias after the procedure. Anesthesia dolorosa occurred in one patient and medical treatment was given. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN. Unlike CRF, this is associated with neuritis-like reactions and motor deficits, whereas PRF seems to have transient side effects.

A lawsuit has been filed in California Superior Court on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during early pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a severe heart defect. According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication. September 1 – Lawsuit filed today in the Central District of California by a mother who blames GSK for failing to warn about the risk of birth defects from Zofran. Plaintiff asserts that she has no family history of neural tube defects, and that her daughter’s problems are the result of exposure to Zofran in the womb. September 29 – An Alameda County couple filed a lawsuit today in San Francisco federal court alleging that the mother’s use of Zofran during pregnancy caused their daughter to be born with severe heart damage that required open heart surgery. November 6 – A man and wife from Florida filed suit against GSK today in a federal court in San Francisco alleging that the woman’s use of Zofran for morning sickness during pregnancy caused their son to be born with a bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate. The boy underwent his first medical intervention within weeks of being born and had has first surgery before the age of one year, yet continues to suffer developmental delays and problems with eating, drinking and hearing, according to the complaint. Free Confidential Case Evaluation: Again, if your child or other loved one was born with a birth defect after the mother took Zofran in pregnancy, you should contact our law firm immediately. A number of recent studies have explored the alleged connections between maternal use of Zofran and devastating birth defects, including one notable study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology in December 2014, which found double the risk of “hole in the heart” birth defects in babies exposed to Zofran during the first trimester of pregnancy, and a 62% increased risk of birth defects overall. In 2011, a large study conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Slone Epidemiology Center in Massachusetts, reported a two-times increased risk of cleft palate birth defects among children exposed to Zofran during the early stages of pregnancy, when a developing fetus is most susceptible to harm. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against GSK for allegedly marketing Zofran as an off-label treatment for pregnant women, which is illegal, and the drug maker was ordered to pay $3 billion to resolve the claims. HHS replied that they could not find any such reports. While ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines, scientists and the fact-checking site Politifact pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports. How does Zofran cause birth defects? | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Apr 22, 2015 | Comments Off on Are you currently pregnant and taking Zofran? A teratogen is an agent such as drugs, medications, infections, or chemicals causing birth defects or harm to a fetus. Zofran, an antiemetic medication, is potentially linked to birth defects including cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defect (CHD). If you took Zofran during your first trimester of pregnancy, and have a child with birth defects, contact us for a free case consultation. The complaint is filed on behalf of a little boy who was born with Supraventricular Tachycardia,or SVT, a serious heart birth defect. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kershaw and Mr. Talley allege the child’s birth defect was suffered after his mother took Zofran, also known as Ondansetron, during her first trimester of pregnancy. According to the filing, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran, off-label, to alleviate morning sickness she experienced in the early weeks of her pregnancy. The complaint alleges the little boy’s SVT was the direct result of exposure to Zofran in utero. A frequently asked question from potential clients is, “Do I have a Zofran case?” As you may know, Zofran is linked to various birth defects. Typically, in these cases, the mother took Zofran during her first trimester of pregnancy and her child is born with a birth defect(s). The other factor to take into consideration is the type of birth defect. Right now, there is limited research and scientific data connecting Zofran use during pregnancy with birth defects. So, if you just discovered the link between Zofran and birth defects, the statute would start to run from the date of that discovery. If a defendant is intentionally concealing a link between a drug and a birth defect, that concealment or fraud can “toll” the statute of limitations. So, if you took Zofran and have a child with a birth defect, it’s very important to call an attorney immediately. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Mar 24, 2015 | Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? This was first evidenced by the thalidomide tragedy during the post-war era of the 1960’s. Thalidomide was a sleeping pill and tranquilizer marketed as safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it was anything but safe for the fetus. Severe birth defects secondary to Thalidomide prompted the start of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drug approval and monitoring systems. According to The Thalidomide Tragedy: Lessons for Drug Safety and Regulation, “They advertised their product as “completely safe” for everyone, including mother and child, “even during pregnancy,” as its developers “could not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.” This is analogous with GlaxoSmithKline and their advertising of Zofran as safe during pregnancy. Additionally, reproduction studies testing Zofran and it’s teratogenic effects were only performed on pregnant rabbits and rats, much like thalidomide. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The ramifications from a lack of testing on human subjects was substantiated with thalidomide. It’s ironic how the thalidomide tragedy catalyzed the FDA’s rigorous drug testing standards yet these standards don’t appear to have been applied to Zofran. Around the 1960’s, it was discovered thalidomide also alleviated morning sickness. It was subsequently prescribed for off-label use in pregnant patients. In the U.S. today, Zofran is prescribed off-label to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. And similar to Thalidomide, it may cause birth defects. So, how do drugs like Zofran cause birth defects? In the case of Thalidomide, it was discovered that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. In other words, the dosage’s rate of transfer from the mother’s blood stream to the unborn child is significant. Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? On March 17th, a ValleyNewsLive.com segment reported on a North Dakota woman treated with Zofran, the antiemetic, during her pregnancy. In 2014, Dr. Gideon Koren of the The Motherisk Program of Toronto, Canada released a study detailing fetal safety concerns regarding Zofran. This is only the latest of several reports raising awareness about the link between Zofran and significant birth defects. We continually follow developments regarding Zofran and it’s association with birth defects as part of our firm’s ongoing investigation into this matter. We currently evaluate potential Zofran cases on behalf of families whose child was allegedly born with a birth defect secondary to in utero exposure to this drug. Mothers, Cheri Flynn and Tomisha LeClair, were unaware there was a risk of birth defects when they took Zofran, an anti-emetic, for morning sickness during their pregnancies. The physicians prescribing Zofran were also unaware of these risks. However, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturers of Zofran, knew about the potential chance of birth defects, and illegally marketed and promoted the drug to physicians as safe for use in pregnant women. Therefore, doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but GlaxoSmithKline cannot legally promote those uses. Ms. Flynn and Ms. LeClair filed product liability lawsuits against GlaxoSmithKline in February 2015. They both claim Zofran (Ondansetron) use during their respective pregnancies caused severe birth defects in their children. The respective lawsuits assert GlaxoSmithKline failed to warn consumers and medical professionals of the link between Zofran (Ondansetron) and an elevated risk of congenital heart defects, cleft lip and cleft palate. Ms. Flynn took Zofran during two of her pregnancies. Her complaint alleges taking Zofran during her pregnancies caused congenital heart defects in her children who were born in 2004 and 2006; Ms. LeClair claims her daughter suffers from heart malformations and a permanent developmental delay secondary to Zofran (Ondansetron) use during her pregnancy. This is not GlaxoSmithKline’s first time falsely misleading the public. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for promoting and marketing Zofran for off-label uses to doctors. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but the manufacturers of Zofran cannot promote those uses. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) manufactures Zofran. They directly promoted and marketed Zofran for off-label uses (i.e. This is illegal. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for these illegal practices. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, most major birth defects occur within the first trimester. The researchers found an increased risk of obstructive defects of the renal pelvis and ureter (tube expelling urine from kidneys). Additionally, there was a 20% increased risk of a major birth defect among children exposed to ondansetron (Zofran) in the first trimester. Or did you take a generic version of Zofran, such as Ondansetron? If Congenital Heart Defect, what type? The complaint included accompanying exhibits, only some of which have become public. In his complaint, Bright also noted the dangers in pursuing EIDD-2801 (now marketed under the tradename Molnupiravir), an oral antiviral candidate previously supported by NIAID led by Dr. Anthony Fauci and DOD.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply.

The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\n During the first months of the pandemic in the country, several government officials were reported to have been tested for COVID-19 without complying with the initial triage algorithm used by the Department of Health (DOH), which restricted asymptomatic individuals from being tested. Some family and staff members were also reportedly tested for COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the Philippines had only tested 1,793 people due to the lack of testing kits. Public officials receiving quick results on their tests was perceived to be tantamount to receiving priority treatment as numerous people considered as actual patients under investigation – many of whom were front liners – were dying before their test results were out. In September 2020, with the improvement of testing capabilities and change in algorithm that focused on front liners and people who were in contact with COVID-infected patients, the government reported that over 3 million people had been tested.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Fishel has published more than 200 papers, as well as a number of books, including the 1986 bestseller In Vitro Fertilisation: Past Present \n\nGene Editing Is Here, and Desperate Patients Want It :: Henry I. Miller , M.D. Should Americans be allowed to edit their DNA to prevent genetic diseases in their children? That question, which once might have sounded like science fiction, is stirring debate as breakthroughs bring the idea closer to reality. Bioethicists and activists, worried about falling down the slippery slope to genetically modified Olympic athletes, are calling for more regulation. Anachronistic restrictions at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health effectively ban gene-editing research in human embryos that would lead to implantation and births. That altered DNA cannot be passed down to the patient's offspring. A string of qualified successes followed, with promising early results for afflictions ranging from fatal genetic diseases to Parkinson's. More controversial is editing the DNA of eggs, sperm and embryos, since those changes would be passed on to future generations. Last month a Chinese group led by Junjiu Huang announced it had used a refinement of the Crispr system on human embryos to correct the mutated gene responsible for a blood disorder called beta-thalassemia. As to the ethics, it would be unacceptable to modify normal embryos—the cliché about \"designer babies\"—but nobody is proposing to do that, and no American regulatory agency would approve it. If the concern is that embryos may be destroyed, parents with genetic diseases are already discarding many while using in vitro fertilization as a way to avoid passing on abnormal DNA. Today's state-of-the-art approach is to create a set of embryos, test them for the faulty gene, implant a normal one, and discard the rest. The use of Crispr gene-editing to correct abnormal embryos would likely result in fewer being destroyed. The potential to help millions of people avoid horrific genetic conditions is nearly within scientists' grasp. Today they aren't—and desperate patients deserve access to whatever cures this technology may be able to provide. The public thinks so, too. The government has laid down draft legislation which will change the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 to allow mitochondrial DNA transfer. The procedure, which was developed British scientists, is currently banned, but ministers want to change the law to prevent children suffering debilitating conditions like muscular dystrophy. Under the new rules, IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) clinics will be able to replace an egg's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor's egg. It is controversial because it would result in babies having DNA from three people – and effectively, two mothers. \"The Government has run a comprehensive and transparent process over the lifetime of this Parliament to review the public acceptability of mitochondrial donation and the ongoing evidence of safety and efficacy of the new techniques involved,” said public health minister Jane Ellison in a written statement. Although rare, the disorders can be passed to future generations through the maternal line. If the new laws are voted in, it will be up to the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), to decide whether a treatment can go ahead on a case-by-case basis. While many doctors and scientists applaud the move, pointing out that it could eliminate terrible diseases, critics argue \"mitochondrial transfer\" could lead to designer babies. Human trials can then begin immediately. The move was welcomed by scientists and charities. Scientists at Newcastle University, who developed one of the techniques already have a waiting list of women eager to take part in the first trials. Prof Mary Herbert, Professor of Reproductive Biology, Newcastle University said: “We are delighted that the government is taking this forward. “We believe that this technique could open up the possibility of motherhood untainted by the fear of passing on a painful, debilitating condition to their future children. Human cloning “Somatic cell nuclear transfer” technology can be used to bring about the birth of replica offspring, and to create embryos for experimentation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is generally spread when an infected person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the lungs, but can spread to any part of the body. Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria. But, TB can remain dormant in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. Humans are the only known reservoirs of M. tuberculosis. A misconception is that M. tuberculosis can be spread by shaking hands, making contact with toilet seats, sharing food or drink, or sharing toothbrushes. When in the lungs, M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium.

As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place \n\nAfter the implementation of the Romanian national clean air law, there were several changes in the smoke-free rules in the foster care system. Specifically, there was a 10.6% increase in bans on non-cigarette tobacco products, an 18.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for adults, a 10.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for children, and a 9% increase in the prohibition of smoking in cars to transport children. However, the perception of indoor smoking bans did not change significantly. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in ensuring smoke-free environments in cars that are used to transport children in foster care. The implementation of comprehensive smoking bans has been associated with several health benefits. Smoking bans have also been found to improve respiratory health. The bans resulted in improved air quality, reduced exposure to second-hand smoke, and decreased respiratory symptoms. Bans on smoking in cars have also been associated with positive respiratory health effects in children (Kabir et al., 2009). Overall, comprehensive smoking bans have demonstrated numerous health benefits including reduced rates of heart attacks, improved respiratory health in both adults and children, and positive effects on maternal and infant health. The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building. The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\nBriefly freezing a portion of the eye’s surface can protect many premature infants against blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a disease that causes visual loss in 2,600 infantsin the United States annually. However, the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Committee,which determined the safety and efficacy of the treatment, believedphysicians who provide care for premature infants should be informedof these findings. It creates a ring ofscar tissue and slows or stops the growth of these vessels, haltingthe progression of ROP. Study investigators examined 3862 premature infants whose low birth-weight put them at risk for ROP. However, 291 infants developed severe ROP and, after the informed consent of their parents was obtained, were entered into the cryotherapy study. The preliminary results concern 172 of these infants. All the premature infants enrolled in the CRYO-ROP Study were at least 28 days old, weighed less than 2.76 pounds at birth, had no other major eye or systemic abnormalities, and had ROP that had reached a threshold level of severity (“Stage 3 with plus’ disease” according to the International Classification ofRetinopathy of Prematurity) in at least on eye. Infants who had developed the threshold level of disease in only one eye were randomlyassigned to receive cryotherapy in that eye or no eye treatment. Ifthe second eye of the untreated babies developed threshold level ROP,then that eye was treated. Therefore, all infants with two eyeseligible for treatment had the opportunity to receive cryotherapy inone eye. Medical evaluation of all the babies in the CRYO-ROP study will continue and analyses of data on the long-term effects of cryotherapy for ROP will continue to be assessed over the next several years. Bothshort- and long-term evaluations of the treatment will provide valuable information about the natural course of ROP as well as about the visual prognosis of low birth-weight premature infants. An ROP epidemic occurred in the 1940s and early1950s when hospital nurseries began using excessively high levels ofoxygen in incubators to save the lives of premature infants. Theresults of that study influenced the way oxygen has been used in thecare of premature infant to the present day. However, as advances in neonatal care in the 1970s and 1980s enablethe survival of very low birth-weight babies (those under 3.3 pounds),a second ROP epidemic has developed despite superb technology thatregulates oxygen levels carefully. About the same number of infantslose their vision from ROP today as were blinded by the disease at theheight of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s. While the causes of ROPare still not fully understood, cryotherapy now offers an opportunityto improve the visual prospects of many premature infants who developROP. Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors\n\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:\n Prematurity\n High exposure to oxygen\n Low birth weight\n Various types of infections\n Cardiac defects\n Anaemia \n Low vitamin E level\n\nPathophysiology\n\nDuring development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.) This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina. Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (Respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, Intra ventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening. Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. Monitoring\n\nIn order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006. They included infants with birthweights under 1500 grams or under 30 weeks gestation in most cases. Furthermore, recent trials have shown that treatment at an earlier stage of the disease gives better results. Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes. Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. In others, only children treated for ROP are followed yearly. Follow up of premature children (with or without ROP) is varying among centers and countries, mirroring the diverse states of health care system in different countries. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children. ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants. There is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided. In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment. In 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world. This report contained three main findings: \n Premature birth has many different causes, and prevention is challenging,\n Prematurity is the most common cause of neonatal death in many countries, totaling as many as 1 million infants annually due to complications of preterm birth, and\n the number of preterm births is currently estimated to be 15 million, and increasing. History\n\nThis disease was first described in a premature baby in 1942. Between 1941–1953, over 12,000 babies worldwide were affected by it. Cases were then seen all over the world and the cause was, at that point, unknown. By 1951 a clear link between incidence and affluence became clear: many cases were seen in developed countries with organized and well-funded health care. Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted. Each case of ROP avoided by withholding oxygen \"may have cost some 16 deaths\". References\n\nExternal links\n\n Retinopathy of Prematurity Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI).

Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted. Each case of ROP avoided by withholding oxygen \"may have cost some 16 deaths\". References\n\nExternal links\n\n Retinopathy of Prematurity Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI).

Robotically assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery, but the surgeon uses a robotic device instead of a laparoscope to do the procedure. Dr. Michael Zinner, chief of surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said there are advantages to robotically assisted surgery in certain situations. If the surgeon has any slight tremor, the machine evens it out,\" he said. Robotically assisted hysterectomies were performed 0.5 percent of the time in 2007. But at hospitals without the robotic option, use of laparoscopic hysterectomy increased during the same time period. Robotically assisted hysterectomy was less likely to lead to a hospital stay of two days or more compared to laparoscopic surgery, but the two procedures were similar in all other measured complications. \"It seems like at this point in time, insurers are paying the same whether the surgery is robotically assisted or not. If you're considering a robotically assisted procedure, Zinner and Weissman advised talking with your doctor about which procedure will deliver better results. If two procedures are similarly effective, they suggested comparing costs. In the case of hysterectomy, because robotically assisted surgery and laparoscopic surgery have similar results but significantly different costs, Zinner said he'd like to see more surgeons training in the laparoscopic procedure. Major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Due to these techniques, there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery. Memory devices play an essential role in preventing any inconveniences in the robot-assisted surgery. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear. The first report of robotic surgery in gynecology was published in 1999 from the Cleveland Clinic The adoption of robotic surgery has contributed to the increase in minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic disease. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery and the rate of complications may be higher, but there are not enough high-quality studies to know at the present time. In the United States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions was shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy in 2015, with no difference in overall rates of complications. This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. There is inconsistent evidence of benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs. Robotic surgery has also been utilized in radical cystectomies.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Bio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a product that was approved in February 2012 for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in conjunction with a medical condition like undescended testicles, chemotherapy side effects, or brain disorders. These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. Since then, numerous studies have backed up these findings. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. Many Testim lawsuits have already been filed against Endo for injuries caused by the testosterone gel. Testosterone regulates growth and the development of male gender characteristics. When applied topically, Testim gel increases bone density, muscle growth and libido, enhances sexual function and increases energy levels. The formulation was designed for use in men aged 18 and older who do not produce enough natural testosterone due to a malfunction of the testes, known as hypogonadism. Unfortunately, many men have been prescribed testosterone gel and replacement therapy for age-related decline of male hormones or “low-T” which has been a popular advertising subject. This use of testosterone is not approved by the FDA and may increase the chance for serious complications. It was approved in 2002 as a 1% testosterone gel formulation to be applied to the skin on a daily basis. The studies showed that men who are treated with hormone supplement therapy may experience heart attack or stroke at a three times greater rate than those who do not take the medications. March 2015, the FDA ordered Testim and other testosterone manufacturers to update product labels with information about an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking FDA-approved testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating the issue. The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" The changes were more pronounced with oral testosterone undecanoate than with parenteral routes, such as transdermal testosterone. Testosterone showed no significant effect on depressed mood anxiety, bone mineral density (BMD), or anthropomorphic measures like body weight or body mass index. Conversely, it was associated with a significant incidence of androgenic side effects, including acne and hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth). Other androgenic side effects, such\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. Taken together, these factors increase the likelihood that Lyme-carrying ticks will encounter humans unfamiliar with their risk — a major concern, warns Jay Lemery, who oversees the wilderness and environmental section at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine. Lemery advised Utahns to learn to check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been in wooded or grassy areas, because tick bites are less likely to transmit diseases if the tick is removed quickly. Lemery said Utahns should be aware that ticks may be much smaller than they anticipate and will hide in skin folds or crevices. Peterson urged Utahns headed outdoors to wear protective clothing and insect repellent, which will deter both mosquitoes and ticks. Utahns should see their physician if they develop flulike symptoms, a fever or a rash after recreating outdoors. With summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. And new studies say global climate change may be increasing the range of disease-carrying ticks and the amount of time they are active. Both Riverside County and the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District do not look for ticks. “We actually discontinued routine tick collections/testing a few years ago to focus our resources on mosquito control and West Nile virus surveillance which is a much higher priority here in Southern California,” wrote Keith Jones, deputy director of the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health in an emailed response. “We always wrestle with that question: What risk do we have for Lyme disease for people who go hiking,” said Kelly Middleton, spokesperson for the Greater LA district. Orange County has a very low prevalence for Lyme disease. So the tick no longer has the ability to spread the disease, she said. Ixodes pacificus, or the western blacklegged tick, has been found in 56 of 58 California counties. In some parts of the state, more people are infected by nymphs than adult ticks. Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease which in some cases can lead to hearing loss, pneumonia and death, is relatively rare in the United States due to high vaccination rates. One of the 2011 outbreaks also was in Indiana. Dr. Jorge Parada, professor of medicine and direction of the infection prevention and control program at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, said the reason for the increased cases of measles in the U.S. was reduced rates of vaccination. Transmission had occurred in Indiana this year in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccinated status, according to Indiana health department spokeswoman Amy Reel. According to the 2010 CDC National Immunization Survey, over 92 percent of Indiana children aged 19-35 months have at least one dose of the MMR or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The Adams County case has been traced to an unvaccinated person travelling to a country where measles is prevalent, according to the state health department. State and county Health Departments were investigating the new case to prevent further transmission. While no longer infectious, officials warn that people who visited the Bluffton Regional Medical Center on February 20 may have been exposed to the disease when the measles sufferer went to the emergency room that evening. No additional cases have been reported as a result of the Super Bowl Village exposure. Three-quarters of all U.S. measles cases last year were transmitted locally, within the United States, rather than being picked up in another country. for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox. Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite Hispanic and African American children under 5 years old.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The House version differed slightly from the Senate version, directing funds for research to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, rather than directly to the National Institutes of Health. \"By passing this landmark single-disease legislation, the House has recognized the daily plight of the thousands of families struggling every day with autism, and has once and for all acknowledged autism as a national healthcare crisis,\" said Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks and chairman and CEO of NBC Universal. The House passed a version that would grant more authority to scientists to determine research priorities, whereas the Senate's original measure would have included funds for expansion of research into the causes of autism. The revised bill, ultimately approved by the Senate, did not include the provisions that would have specified funding for investigating possible environmental causes. \"This bill is a federal declaration of war on the epidemic of autism\", said Jon Shestack, co-founder of Cure Autism Now. \"It creates a congressionally mandated road map for a federal assault on autism, including requirements for strategic planning, budget transparency, Congressional oversight, and a substantial role for parents of children with autism in the federal decision-making process.\" Provisions\nThe Act provides money for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to conduct epidemiological surveillance programs and would re-authorize the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) to coordinate all efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services concerning autism, including activities carried out through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CDC. The Act requires the director of NIH to develop and implement a strategic plan for autism research and a budget to fund this plan. The act provides grant programs for states to develop autism screening, early diagnosis, and intervention programs for children.

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR). The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical \n\nAbortion in Bangladesh is illegal under most situations, but menstrual regulation is often used as a substitute. Historically, abortion has been prevalent, especially during the years following the Bangladesh Liberation War. For example, in 1972, the law allowed for abortion for those women who has been raped during the war. As a result, some women turn to illegal abortions. Abortion \nAn abortion can be legally performed by a physician in a hospital, if it is necessary to save the life of the mother. A person who performs an abortion under any other circumstances, including a woman who self-aborts, can be punished by a fine and imprisonment. According to an article by the Guttmacher Institute, which studied the rural district of Matlab, illegal abortion is becoming increasingly prevalent despite the availability of safer methods of fertility control. A study by Mizanur Rahman and Julie DaVanzo showed that between 2000 and 2008, a woman was more likely to die from the complications of unsafe abortion than from childbirth itself, and that death rates from childbirth were similar of the death rates for the complications of menstrual regulation. Another study in Matlab found that between 1982 and 1998, abortion about 35 times more prevalent among unmarried adolescent girls than among married adolescent girls, and it was much higher among who were less than 18 years of age and those who passed or had more than primary education. The United Nations estimated that in 2000, the abortion rate was 4.0 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It is often associated with inflammation and has many potential causes, including an acute infection in the mother, exposure to environmental toxins, or chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The new test screens for 25 biomarkers of inflammation and immune system activation, as well as for levels of proteins that are important for placenta development. Combined with information on other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and income, the test can predict whether a woman is at risk for preterm birth with more than 80 percent accuracy. In the highest risk pregnancies—preterm births occurring before 32 weeks or in women with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure in the mother—the test predicted nearly 90 percent of cases. The researchers also wanted to be able to identify risk for preeclampsia, which is not included in current tests for preterm birth. The researchers first tested the samples for more than 60 different immune and growth factors, ultimately narrowing the test down to 25 factors that together could help predict risk for preterm birth. Researchers said the test could help prevent some cases of preterm birth. Based on a woman’s probability of preterm birth derived by the test, she could discuss with her clinician how best to follow-up and try to lower her risk. Some cases of preterm birth, including those caused by preeclampsia, can be prevented or delayed by taking aspirin, but treatment is most helpful if started before 16 weeks. Physicians could also evaluate high-risk women for underlying infections that may have gone undetected but could be treated. For others, close monitoring by their doctor could help flag early signs of labor like cervical shortening that can be staved off with progesterone treatment. A test for preterm birth is currently available, but it is expensive and only screens for spontaneous preterm birth, not for signs that could lead to indicated preterm births or for preeclampsia. But sometimes delivery occurs sooner than expected. Strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all prenatal checkups. While the majority of premature births result from unexpected, spontaneous preterm labor (often following premature rupture of the membranes), 20 percent are early inductions due to pregnancy complications such as vaginal bleeding; uterine abnormalities; as well as health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. In such cases, early delivery may be the safest route for mother and baby. Because many of these conditions are often symptomless, they are difficult to prevent and diagnose in pregnancy. Women who smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs may also have a higher risk of delivering prematurely. Studies show that women have a higher risk if they are pregnant with multiples (twins or triplets), have had a previous preterm birth, or have certain uterine or cervical abnormalities. Unfortunately, there are additional inborn factors that may increase your risk of preterm labor. There are now treatments to help prevent preterm labor in certain high-risk women. Studies indicate that the hormone progesterone, when given in mid pregnancy, can decrease the rate of preterm delivery by 30 percent in women who have had a previous preterm birth. When present in late pregnancy (between 22 and 34 weeks), fibronectin may indicate the possibility of preterm delivery. These diagnostic tests can accurately determine which women with contractions are unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. The good news is that 80 percent of women who show signs of preterm labor don't deliver prematurely. This extra time can also enable your doctor to make arrangements for you to deliver in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit. Though these options can't completely prevent preterm birth, a group of drugs called tocolytics can now delay delivery for two to seven days. Tocolytics have been shown to be most effective when given early in labor. If you are less than 34 weeks pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with corticosteroids. These drugs work to speed the maturation of your baby's lungs and can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications and death. Corticosteriods are administered as maternal injections and have proven to be most effective when given at least 24 hours before delivery. Could This Drug Be the Solution to Preventing Pre-Term Birth for Good? These tests don't directly detect hypoxia, but instead detects the general well-being of the baby and ensures that the baby is healthy since hypoxia causes a wide range of responses. These tests can include prenatal testing, such as fetal movement and amniotic fluid levels, Doppler examination, or fetal heart rate. Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia. Studies have shown a connection between tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and hypoxia-ischemia brain injury, though further studies need to be done. Measuring fetal BH4 levels can be another way to look out for intrauterine hypoxia. During birth, birth asphyxia can occur in which cardiotocograph can be used to monitor the baby's health during labor. What Health Risks Do Preemies Face? Most premature births result from spontaneous preterm labor -- and about half the time, the doctor can&apos;t determine the cause. Even if you do everything right, you may still deliver prematurely. If you&apos;re planning a pregnancy, see your doctor for a preconception checkup. She can identify health risks, such as STDs, that may contribute to preterm labor. If you&apos;ve delivered prematurely before, your doctor can inject you during pregnancy with progesterone, a hormone that might reduce your risk of having another early birth. Weight gain within this range significantly cuts risk of premature delivery. She may also perform a vaginal ultrasound to get a better look at your cervix and a vaginal swab to measure levels of fibronectin, a biological glue that helps attach the fetal sac to the uterine lining. If none is detected, you're unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. Fortunately, most women with possible signs of preterm labor go on to deliver at term. If tests show you're in preterm labor, your doctor may treat you with tocolytics, medicines that can postpone delivery. The delay is only a couple of days but gives you time to take a dose of corticosteroids, which speed development of your baby's lungs and reduce the risk of serious newborn complications.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. In a 6 year double blind placebo controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology\n\nMechanisms of action\n\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage. Physical and chemical properties\nChondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides: D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). \"Chondroitin sulfate B\" is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate.

Clinical trials for osteoarthritis\n\nIn 2004, a petition was submitted to the FDA that a dietary supplement of chondroitin sulfate be labeled as reducing the risk of osteoarthritis, cartilage deterioration, and osteoarthritis-related joint pain, tenderness, and swelling.

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250 mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200 mg capsules of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, two capsules of 250 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200 mg of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. It showed no difference from placebo. 2010 evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 people with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2 mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200 mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months.

Although these products are evaluated for safety, they are not required to prove efficacy, and actual scientific support of their benefits for osteoarthritis in horses are poor. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. Elgenoflex along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise and pain medications can help reduce moderate to severe pain of patients with osteoarthritis. Degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, etc. The vast majority of supplements to support joint, and connective tissue health contain glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), as well as their combinations, which are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials. Along with glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Elgenoflex also contains BioCell Collagen, which is a multifunctional, patented ingredient for joint, and vascular support. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and makes the supplement more effective for patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis. An abnormal immune response against the patient’s own collagen type II (cartilage collagen) is thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis in the knees and hands. After a pioneering study was published in 1993, a number of studies reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, short collagen fragments (as found in collagen hydrolysates such as BioCell Collagen used in Elgenoflex) reduce joint swelling and tenderness, and improve several other criteria used to assess the disease. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis, such as a reduction in pain and physical function impairment, and an improvement in performing daily activities, although it does not affect joint stiffness. CAN ELGENOFLEX BE BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment is aimed mainly at preventing joint damage and alleviating symptoms. One of the auto antigens thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis is cartilage collagen type II [3,4,5,6]. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of knee and hand osteoarthritis  and with osteoarthritis flares . Accordingly, a recent study of 3,582 osteoarthritis patients concluded that a fragment of collagen type II is the most informative biochemical marker for prediction of this disease. A number of studies have documented the beneficial effects of supplementation with collagen type II hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. After a pioneering study was published in 1993 in Science  , a number of studies have reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the exact origin of the supplement in this study was not specified, and it was unclear whether the collagen was hydrolyzed. A larger study (36 rheumatoid arthritis patients) found statistically significant improvements in the joint swelling score, Ritchie's index (a measure of joint tenderness), disease activity score, and Health Assessment Questionnaire score in patients given collagen tripeptides for three months in comparison with the placebo group, although no improvement in the subjective condition of the patients was found . Another pilot study (13 participants) assessed the effects of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well as uveitis associated with this condition . A much larger phase III clinical trial assessed the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in comparison with methotrexate, a drug that is approved for treatment of this disease . This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, which enrolled a total of 503 participants, used administration of 0.1 g of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate daily for 24 weeks. Using several variables to assess the effects of the treatments on the disease, the authors found that the collagen hydrolysate effectively alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Some of its effects were slightly weaker than the effects of methotrexate, but collagen hydrolysate also had fewer and milder side effects in comparison with methotrexate. These studies indicate that chicken type II collagen hydrolysate can be used as a supplement for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. Another randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . A more recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain involved 108 physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . A progressive loss of glycosaminoglycans is observed during the progression of osteoarthritis, and glycosaminoglycan content in cartilage tissue is used to grade the osteoarthritis stages . Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in bodily pain and social functioning were greater in the in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 60 patients who were asked to perform daily physical exercise found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (0.2 g daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of synovial fluid and cartilage, and is a component of a number of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, where it plays a variety of regulatory roles. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Whereas the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements, chondroitin is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug in European countries . Chondroitin is one of the most popular supplements used by osteoarthritis patients. The authors of a recent systematic meta-analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials, which lasted between one month and three years and involved a total of 9,110 participants (mainly with knee osteoarthritis, with fewer cases of hip or hand osteoarthritis), concluded that chondroitin significantly reduced the narrowing of minimum joint space . In studies shorter than six months, the authors also found that an index that takes into account pain, function, and disability showed statistically significant improvements in patients taking chondroitin in comparison with those taking a placebo. Curiously, this meta-analysis also found that chondroitin resulted in significantly fewer side effects than placebo . Although glucosamine is often used in combination with chondroitin sulfate, it is also effective alone. An example of a study that assessed long-term effects of glucosamine in patients with knee osteoarthritis is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Reginster and colleagues conducted in Belgium, Italy, and the UK, which was published in the highly respected British journal The Lancet . The authors found significant narrowing of the joint space in the placebo group but not in the glucosamine group. The WOMAC scores revealed some worsening of osteoarthritis symptoms in the placebo group but improvement in the glucosamine group . Despite a large number of clinical trials, the efficiency of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate is surrounded by controversy. This can be illustrated by the simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [31,32], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Finally, it should be noted that patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not benefit from glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements . Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis. For example, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, 50 patients with knee osteoarthritis received MSM (6 g daily) or a placebo for 12 weeks . Another 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that involved 118 patients with knee osteoarthritis found that MSM reduced pain in comparison with the placebo group . A more recent randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial enrolled 49 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received MSM (ca. Although Usha and Naidu  found pain reduction in patients taking MSM, this supplement alone was inferior to glucosamine, and a combination of MSM and glucosamine was more effective than each supplement individually. Similarly, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to act synergistically . These observations, together with the controversy regarding the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin, suggest that beneficial effects of each of these substances may be relatively small and noticeable only under certain circumstances or in certain groups of patients.

The former is characterized by short, deformed bones, enlarged joints, and pain in joints that restricts patients’ movement [3,4]. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains low-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) [13,14]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . Both the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores and physical activity were significantly improved in comparison with the placebo group after five weeks of BioCell Collagen supplementation, and this effect persisted until the end of the trial (10 weeks). No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with knee osteoarthritis used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . An important study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial conducted by McAlindon and colleagues , who used sophisticated imaging technology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately measure short-term changes in knee hyaline cartilage in osteoarthritis patients taking collagen hydrolysate. Collagen type II hydrolysates are also effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For example, a phase III clinical trial (503 participants in total) compared the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate (0.1 g daily for 24 weeks) with those of methotrexate, an approved rheumatoid arthritis drug . The authors found that the collagen hydrolysate alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Thus, collagen type II hydrolysates have beneficial effects in healthy people with strenuous physical activity as well as patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in pain and social functioning were greater in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . Similar results were obtained in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted in Japan and enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of the synovial fluid and cartilage, and is widely used as a separate supplement in patients with osteoarthritis (see review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Despite a large number of clinical trials that used chondroitin sulfate, there has been a continuous controversy over the last decade regarding its efficiency . To address the latter issue, Monfort and colleagues have recently used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess pain in osteoarthritis patients taking chondroitin sulfate or a placebo for four months . In this phase IV, randomized, double-blind trial, the patients taking chondroitin sulfate but not those in the placebo group tended to report reduced subjective pain, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. These findings not only confirm the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate but also set a precedent for the use of a technique that may help resolve uncertainties in the efficacy of other supplements that are assumed to alleviate pain. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers chondroitin sulfate as a food supplement; in European countries, it is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug . Genet Med 5, 21-27 (2003).

Is chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine superior to placebo in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis covered in a separate article. A study conducted at Penn State University examined the effect of supplementation with a collagen type II hydrolysate on activity-related joint pain in 147 healthy athletes . The participants were taking either collagen hydrolysate (10 g daily) or a placebo for 24 weeks; joint pain was assessed by the participants in five different situations (like walking or lifting weight) and also by a physician. Another study that reported the ability of collagen hydrolysates to alleviate pain was conducted in Wisconsin (USA) and involved 20 patients with fibromyalgia; 12 of them also had pain in the temporomandibular joint . Some professional activities, such as farming, are also known to increase the risk of osteoarthritis . Out of three kinds of pain (at rest, on pressing, and on moving) in four joints (ankle, knee, hip and shoulder), pain on moving in the ankle was found to be the strongest and was thus chosen as a benchmark for the effect of the extract. Thus, glucosamine supplementation may have chondroprotective effects in athletes. A recent systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials that lasted for at least one year was aimed at identifying substances effective in preserving articular cartilage and delaying the development of knee osteoarthritis . The authors examined available data for 12 treatments, which included glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (other components of Elgenoflex, i.e. This study found that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were the only effective treatments to delay or prevent osteoarthritis progression. It should be noted that in this case the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were analyzed separately, whereas their effects are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [16,17]. Likewise, a combination of methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . Thus, supplements that contain several active ingredients, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be most efficient in alleviating pain and delaying the development of musculoskeletal disorders than supplements that contain only one or fewer ingredients.

Use of nutraceuticals in the management of osteoarthritis. Most of the available guidelines regarding the use of Elgenoflex components concern the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). This can be illustrated by simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [2,3], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin sulfate has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a placebo-controlled study conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) at 16 US universities and health centers, investigated the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (1500 mg and 1200 mg daily, respectively, for up to 24 weeks) in relieving pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis . The results of GAIT indicated that the glucosamine / chondroitin sulfate combination but not each supplement separately statistically significantly reduced pain in patients with moderate-to-severe pain in comparison with the placebo group. No significant improvement in pain was found in patients with mild pain. A later reanalysis of the data also suggested a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on knee joint swelling, particularly in patients with milder pain . On the basis of the GAIT results, the NIH guidelines recommend taking glucosamine plus chondroitin sulfate as a possible component of a comprehensive management plan (along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise, and pain medications) for osteoarthritis patients with moderate-to-severe pain . Despite these NIH guidelines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements and does not regulate them as medications. The FDA also considers that the link between glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate and a reduced risk of osteoarthritis has not been reliably established . The British National Health Service (NHS) considers chondroitin and glucosamine treatments not to be cost-effective enough in patients with osteoarthritis to warrant their prescription under the NHS scheme . However, the NHS guidelines issued in 2010 and reviewed in 2012, which are based on recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the UK Department of Health, recognize that glucosamine (1500 mg daily) is effective in mild or modest reduction of pain in some patients. The NHS guidelines also recommend patients who decide to take glucosamine to evaluate their pain before starting the supplement and after three months, to evaluate whether it is beneficial for them . Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are recognized as osteoarthritis drugs in some European countries . In France, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are considered drugs acting over long periods of time and are available as medications; after intense discussions on the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as symptomatic drugs for patients with osteoarthritis of the lower extremities, the French National Authority for Health (La Haute Autorité de santé — HAS) decided in 2008 to maintain their status, and medications that contain these substances (except one) continue to be partially reimbursed by the national social security system (Sécurité Sociale) . Similarly, the Association of Rheumatologists of Russia recommends prescribing chondroitin sulfate (500 mg twice daily over long periods of time) for patients with knee osteoarthritis and glucosamine sulfate (1500 mg daily for 4–12 weeks two or three times a year) for patients with knee and hand osteoarthritis . The guidelines of the OsteoArthritis Research Society International (OARSI) for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis  recognize the use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate for symptom relief as well as their possible “structure-modifying effects”. OARSI recommends that glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or their combination be taken for an initial period of six months and discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is apparent after this treatment. Similar to the NHS recommendations in the UK, in Denmark physicians starting treatment of a patient with osteoarthritis are advised to consider the use of glucosamine sulfate for a trial period of three months; if there is no improvement in symptoms after this period, NSAIDs are prescribed instead . Whereas most guidelines concern the management of knee osteoarthritis, the recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) on management of hand osteoarthritis note that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate “have a symptomatic effect and low toxicity, but effect sizes are small, [and] suitable patients are not well defined” . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that taking a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) but not placebo for 16 weeks resulted in moderate but significant improvements in parameters related to pain and walking function or going up and down the stairs, and also increased the ratio of collagen synthesis to its degradation . A more recent study, which was also double-blind and placebo-controlled, found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (200 mg daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . However, the above studies indicate that oral intake of hyaluronic acid at doses corresponding to one to four Elgenoflex pills would have beneficial effects at least in patients knee osteoarthritis. For example, in a recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . Although MSM is often included in commercial supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, it is inferior to glucosamine when used alone , and no clinical guidelines for its use as a separate supplement are available. However, when used in combination with glucosamine, MSM was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . A particularly strong placebo effect is observed in patients with osteoarthritis, especially with respect to alleviation of pain; this effect is usually larger than specific effects of available treatments [25,26,27]. None of the treatments, including celecoxib, showed statistically significant differences from the placebo (although celecoxib and glucosamine showed beneficial trends), but the placebo resulted in a graduate decline in the WOMAC score for pain, which plateaued at about 50% of the initial value in 6–7 months and remained at this level until the end of the study (i.e. As pain relief is one of the aims of any osteoarthritis treatment, it has been argued that the placebo effect may be effectively used for the benefits of the patients and should be taken into account when choosing the treatment . If the placebo effect is taken into account, the overall beneficial effect of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate becomes substantial . Finally, it is worth noting that the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [29,30]. Similarly, as mentioned above, methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine combined in the same supplement alleviate pain in osteoarthritis patients more effectively than each substance used alone .

Since only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced in a partial knee replacement, the surgery is less invasive compared to a total knee replacement. Because a partial knee replacement involves a smaller incision and preserves healthy bone and cartilage in the rest of the knee, patients typically experience less pain after the procedure compared to a full knee replacement. Partial knee replacement also tends to involve less blood loss compared to a full knee replacement. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on an individual's specific condition and needs. Moreover, UKAs may require a smaller incision, less tissue damage, and faster recovery times. In the United States, the procedure constitutes approximately 8% of knee arthroplasties. In comparisons with a more extensive surgical procedure called high tibial osteotomy, UKA has equal or better outcomes. Background\nIn the early 1950s, Duncan C. McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint, and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected. Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement. Proper selection, following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA. Indications and contraindications\nUKA may be suitable for people with moderate joint disease caused by painful osteoarthritis or traumatic injury, a history of unsuccessful surgical procedures or poor bone density that precludes other types of knee surgery. The doctor may take some radiographs (e.g., x-rays) to check for degeneration of the other knee compartments and evaluate the knee. Surgical information\nThe surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject's knee. The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced. Benefits\nThe potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision. Another potential benefit is less post-operative pain because less bone is removed. Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma. In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:\n1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement\n2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances. By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge. Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include polyethylene wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment.

McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint, and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected. Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement. Proper selection, following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA. Indications and contraindications\nUKA may be suitable for people with moderate joint disease caused by painful osteoarthritis or traumatic injury, a history of unsuccessful surgical procedures or poor bone density that precludes other types of knee surgery. The doctor may take some radiographs (e.g., x-rays) to check for degeneration of the other knee compartments and evaluate the knee. Surgical information\nThe surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject's knee. The surgeon removes bone from the (tibia) and thigh bone (femur). The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced. Benefits\nThe potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision. Another potential benefit is less post-operative pain because less bone is removed. Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma. In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:\n1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement\n2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances. By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge. Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include polyethylene wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. This finding is similar to what is observed in heavy cocaine and heroin use. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of heavy marijuana use on the brain's dopamine system and to examine potential differences in effects based on frequency and duration of use. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support. Now, a recent study reveals that heavy marijuana use could compromise the dopamine system. Heavy marijuana use is linked with decreased dopamine release in the brain, researchers say. The researchers, who publish their work in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, say that heavy cocaine and heroin use have been shown to decrease dopamine release, but until now, such data regarding cannabis was notably absent. To further investigate whether marijuana dependence is linked with similar effects, the researchers conducted their study in 11 adults aged 21-40 years who were heavily dependent on marijuana, and they matched them with 12 healthy controls. The adults in the marijuana group started using it at around age 16 on average, became dependent by age 20 and had been dependent for around 7 years. Results showed that, compared with the control group, the marijuana users' striatum had lower dopamine release. \"We don't know whether decreased dopamine was a preexisting condition or the result of heavy cannabis use. But the bottom line is that long-term, heavy cannabis use may impair the dopaminergic system, which could have a variety of negative effects on learning and behavior.\" The researchers conclude their study by noting that the lower dopamine release is linked with inattention and negative symptoms in marijuana users, and with \"poorer working memory and probabilistic category learning performance\" in both groups. \"Marijuana use may reduce dopamine in the brain.\" However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. In addition, while there are no fatal overdose cases linked to marijuana, there are deaths linked to synthetic cannabinoids each year. Participants from Oakland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Birmingham were repeatedly measured for pulmonary function, height, smoking behavior, and waist circumference and asked about cigarette and marijuana smoking during each assessment. “People who smoke marijuana inhale very deeply, which may strengthen the muscles used for inhalation – basically making them good at the test. Subjects who smoked larger amounts of marijuana, which Pletcher described as smoking one joint per day, did show evidence of reduced pulmonary function, and he stressed that his study results are not intended to encourage people to use marijuana. However, for patients for whom medical marijuana may be a treatment option, the authors write that \"marijuana may have beneficial effects on pain control, appetite, mood, and management of other chronic symptoms. Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for these or other purposes may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function. It’s important to note that the findings of this study are not meant to encourage marijuana smoking, nor did the study examine other known negative effects of marijuana use, which include problems with memory, concentration and perception.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Both treatments are effective, with a high cure rate in localized disease. The researchers defined medication use as any use of the drugs after surgery or radiation treatment. Taking statins or NSAIDs within 12 months after prostate cancer treatment did not extend lives, Katz tells WebMD. \"The study highlights the potential health benefits of statins and NSAIDs in prostate cancer survivors,\" he says. While the studies were not designed to examine how statins might protect cancer patients, other research has suggested that statin drugs keep prostate cancer cells from growing in the test tube. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent.Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer?Observational studies in which men who don't have prostate cancer are asked about their use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and then followed to see whether they develop prostate cancer suggest that these drugs might help prevent prostate cancer—but the benefit is likely modest and requires long-term regular use. ## Statin Drugs\n\nStatins are prescription drugs that lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by blocking an enzyme called HMG-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase. Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer? So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.The men, ages forty-four to seventy-nine, did not have prostate cancer when the study started in 1990.Ten years later, 2,074 men from the entire study group (those taking statins and those not taking them) had developed prostate cancer.Platz and colleagues found that men who took the cholesterol-lowering drugs had no difference in the risk of early, curable prostate cancer. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer. Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A phase 3 SAMURAI trial of lasmiditan, a serotonin receptor agonist that targets 5-HT1F receptors without vasoconstriction, found the drug was effective and well tolerated for acute migraine among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The study found that significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (at 100 and 200 mg) were free from headache pain and such symptoms as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia at two hours after treating a migraine attack. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors, including those expressed at the trigeminal pathway, and it has been designed for the acute treatment of migraine without the vasoconstrictor activity associated with some migraine therapies, explained Kraig Kinchen, MD, senior medical director of migraine and related therapeutics at Eli Lilly and Company. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, Dr. Kinchen said. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published in Neurology on November 16, just two days after Eli Lilly announced its submission of lasmiditan to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. But they also noted that the drug did have other related side effects, which some patients may not find tolerable. The researchers, led by Bernice Kuca, BA, MS, head of clinical and regulatory operations at CoLucid, tracked 1,856 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura who had three to eight migraine attacks per month and moderate disability, as assessed by a Migraine Disability Assessment score greater than or equal to 11. In the 11-week study, the team randomized patients to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and asked patients to treat their next migraine attack within four hours of onset. He noted, “If I had a patient [who] was worried about cardiovascular risk, even if they tried triptans or not, they might gravitate towards this product. It also depends on the side effect profile.” For example, he said, patients may say they don't like paresthesia, and chest pain and neck discomfort [side effects of triptans], which might cause them to avoid triptan medications. “They may say, ‘I'll take my risk of 15- to 20-percent of dizziness,’” which is a side effect of lasmiditan. Nasim Maleki, PhD, a migraine researcher and assistant professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides a new alternative to a population that would otherwise heighten their risk of cardiovascular events with triptans. Kuca B, Silberstein SD, Wietecha L, et al Lasmiditan is an effective acute treatment for migraine: A phase 3 randomized study http://n.neurology.org/content/91/24/e2222. Eli Lilly has filed a new migraine drug, lasmiditan, with the US regulator, the first drug in its class to be reviewed as a treatment for the condition. An oral drug, lasmiditan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1F agonist that Lilly says is distinct from other approved migraine therapies and does not cause constriction of blood vessels. The filing for lasmiditan includes data from two phase 3 single-attack studies (SAMURAI and SPARTAN), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. In these studies, patients chose their MBS from sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or nausea. Emgality, from the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist class, was approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of migraine in adults in September. There are no approved preventive treatments for episodic cluster headache in the US. A four-year study of 100 chronic migraine sufferers found that after as few as six 30-minute training sessions, 90% of patients reported significant improvements with their migraines. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine determined that carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/day, but it failed to demonstrate that the drug was sufficiently more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis. Triptans such as sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and naratriptan are 5-HT1B receptor agonists that are used to abort migraine and cluster headache attacks. The ergoline antimigraine agent ergotamine also acts on this receptor. Serenics such as batoprazine, eltoprazine, and fluprazine are agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor and other serotonin receptors, and have been found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, but have not been marketed. Eltoprazine is under development for the treatment of aggression and for other indications.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On March 16, 2007 pet food manufacturer Menu Foods announced a recall of dog food sold under 53 brands, and cat food sold under 42 brands, after an unknown number of animals suffered kidney failure after eating it.

Renaming the entire company Cow & Gate in 1929, during the 1930s it worked with medical clinicians to scientifically develop specialized formulas to cater to infants with special needs, including:\n\nMilk allergy is an adverse immune reaction to one or more proteins in cow's milk. In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. Within non-IgE cow's milk allergy, clinicians distinguish among food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Common trigger foods for all are cow's milk and soy foods (including soy infant formula). Infants reacting to cow's milk may also react to soy formula, and vice versa. Some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not. Six major allergenic proteins from cow's milk have been identified: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-casein from casein proteins and α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin from whey proteins. Heat can reduce allergenic potential, so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese. Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, conducted by an allergy specialist. It concluded \"None of the cut-offs proposed in the literature can be used to definitely confirm cow's milk allergy diagnosis, either to fresh pasteurized or to baked milk.\" Lactose intolerance\n\nMilk allergy is distinct from lactose intolerance, which is a nonallergic food sensitivity caused by the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. The unabsorbed lactose reaches the large intestine, where resident bacteria use it for fuel, releasing hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane gases. Primary lactose intolerance is caused by decreasing levels of lactase brought on by age. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. For mothers of infants considered at high risk of developing cow's milk allergy because of a family history, there is some evidence that the nursing mother avoiding allergens may reduce risk of the child developing eczema, but a Cochrane review concluded that more research is needed. Guidelines from various government and international organizations recommend that for the lowest allergy risk, infants be exclusively breastfed for 4–6 months. If a nursing mother decides to start feeding with an infant formula prior to four months the recommendation is to use a formula containing cow's milk proteins. A different consideration occurs when there is a family history – either parents or older siblings – of milk allergy. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a label claim for hydrolyzed whey protein being hypoallergenic. Soy formula is a common substitution, but infants with milk allergy may also have an allergic response to soy formula. Avoiding dairy\n\nMost people find it necessary to strictly avoid any item containing dairy ingredients. Beyond the obvious (anything with milk, cheese, cream, curd, butter, ghee or yogurt in the name), in countries where allergen labeling is mandatory, the ingredient list is supposed to list all ingredients. Anyone with or caring for a person with a dairy protein allergy should always carefully read food package labels, as sometimes even a familiar brand undergoes an ingredient change. In the U.S., for all foods except meat, poultry and egg processed products and most alcoholic beverages, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have the food name in parentheses, for example \"Casein (milk),\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \"Contains milk\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). The U.S. FDA has a recall process for foods that contain undeclared allergenic ingredients. This list contains the following examples:\n\n Bread, baked goods and desserts \n Caramel and nougat candies\n Cereals, crackers, food bars\n Chewing gum \n Chocolate ('milk' and 'dark') \n \"Cream of...\" soups\n Creamy pasta sauces \n Creamy salad dressings\n Eggnog\n Flavored potato chips\n Hot dogs and lunch meat\n Instant mashed potatoes \n Margarine\n Medical food beverages \n Non-dairy creamer\n Sherbet\n Pudding and custard\n\nThere is a distinction between “Contains ___” and “May contain ___.” The first is a deliberate addition to the ingredients of a food, and is required. Nevertheless, some people with cow's milk allergy can tolerate goat's or sheep's milk, and vice versa. Milk from camels, pigs, reindeer, horses, and donkeys may also be tolerated in some cases. Cross-reactivity with soy\nInfants – either still 100% breastfeeding or on infant formula – and also young children may be prone to a combined cow's milk and soy protein allergy, referred to as \"milk soy protein intolerance\" (MSPI). A U.S. state government website presents the concept, including a recommendation that nursing mothers discontinue eating any foods that contain dairy or soy ingredients. A review presented information on milk allergy, soy allergy and cross-reactivity between the two. Milk allergy was described as occurring in 2.2% to 2.8% of infants and declining with age. Soy allergy was described as occurring in zero to 0.7% of young children. According to several studies cited in the review, between 10% and 14% of infants and young children with confirmed cow's milk allergy were determined to also be sensitized to soy and in some instances have a clinical reaction after consuming a soy-containing food. The research did not address whether the cause was two separate allergies or a cross-reaction due to a similarity in protein structure, as which occurs for cow's milk and goat's milk. Recommendations are that infants diagnosed as allergic to cow's milk infant formula be switched to an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula rather than a soy whole protein formula. Prognosis\nMilk allergy typically presents in the first year of life. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy by the age of ten years. Children are often better able to tolerate milk as an ingredient in baked goods relative to liquid milk. Childhood predictors for adult-persistence are anaphylaxis, high milk-specific serum IgE, robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to milk-containing baked foods. The offending protein appears to be bovine serum albumin. Milk allergy has consequences. In a U.S. government diet and health surveys conducted in 2007–2010, 6,189 children ages 2–17 years were assessed. For those classified as cow's milk allergic at the time of the survey, mean weight, height, and body-mass index were significantly lower than their non-allergic peers. The percentage of babies in developed countries with milk allergy is between 2% and 3%. National survey data in the U.S. collected from 2005–2006 showed that from age six and older, the percentage with IgE-confirmed milk allergy was under 0.4%. For all age groups, a review conducted in Europe estimated 0.6% had milk allergy. Society and culture\nDairy allergy was one of the earliest food allergies to be recorded. An ancient Greek medical text attributed to the doctor Hippocrates ( 460 –  370 BC) notes in the context of a description of how some foods are harmful to certain individuals but not others, \"...cheese does not harm all men alike; some can eat their fill of it without the slightest hurt, nay, those it agrees with are wonderfully strengthened thereby. With the passage of mandatory labeling laws, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their immediate caregivers. In the U.S., the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALPA) causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. Regulation of labeling\n\nIn response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods. Nevertheless, there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil. Ingredients intentionally added\nIn the U.S., the FALPA requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains a major food allergen added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. This list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients, such as added milk proteins. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination\nThe value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as \"may contain\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. The EU has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but it is not expected to be published before 2024. Lack of compliance with labeling regulations is also a problem. As an example, the FDA documented failure to list milk as an ingredient in dark chocolate bars. The FDA tested 94 dark chocolate bars for the presence of milk. Many of those did have PAL wording such as \"may contain dairy.\" Others claimed to be \"dairy free\" or \"vegan\" but still tested positive for cow's milk proteins. In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. Research\nDesensitization, which is a slow process of consuming tiny amounts of the allergenic protein until the body is able to tolerate more significant exposure, results in reduced symptoms or even remission of the allergy in some people and is being explored for treatment of milk allergy. There is research – not specific to milk allergy – on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies.

The World Health Organisation has warned repeatedly of the risks to global health from new mutant viruses - of which HIV, SARS virus and Bird Flu virus are just three of many examples we have seen. Just one of these is Bird Flu - caused by virus H5N1. Our world is very open to attack by Bird Flu viruses because we still have no antiviral drugs that are as effective as penicillin and other antibiotics against bacteria. And even if they were, the fact is that 3 billion people live in areas with low health budgets and poorly developed health care systems. It would be impossible to vaccinate the whole world in time, because a Bird Flu pandemic could sweep around the entire globe in a few weeks or months. The H5N1 threat to human health. Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected to occur, on average, three to four times each century when new virus subtypes emerge and are readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence of influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the great influenza pandemic of 1918?1919, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957?1958 and 1968?1969. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, such as that seen in H5N1 is characterized by sudden onset, severe illness, and rapid death, with a mortality that can approach 100%. H5N1 is of particular concern and it is widely held that H5N1 will be cause of the next human pandemic. The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1, which began in mid-December 2003 in the Republic of Korea and is now being seen in other Asian countries, is therefore of particular public health concern. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. The current strategy is to minimize the global public health risks that could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds. An immediate priority is to halt further spread of epidemics in poultry populations. This strategy works to reduce opportunities for human exposure to the virus. Hundred million people could die from flu pandemic warns WHO. Bird flu \"far deadlier than SARS\" Hong Kong (Reuters). Expert warns next flu pandemic could destroy Earth's ecosystem. December 7, 2004.\nWHO Presses Governments, Fearing Bird Flu Pandemic. Flu Pandemic Inevitable, Plans Needed Urgently ?WHO. Doctors say bird flu could overwhelm U.S. hospitals. Expert says Canada not ready for pandemic. UK prepares for flu pandemic. Influenza A viruses normally seen in one species sometimes can cross over and cause severe illness in another species. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred among poultry in 8 countries in Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam ) during late 2003 and early 2004. The avian influenza A (H5N1) epizootic outbreak in Asia is not expected to diminish significantly in the short term. If these H5N1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained transmission between humans, there is little preexisting natural immunity to H5N1 in the human population, and an influenza pandemic could result, with high rates of illness, social disruption, economic loss and death. The World Health Organization estimates that an influenza pandemic involving H5N1 will most likely result in billions of people infected and 100 million deaths. H5N1 is also a concern for becoming a pandemic. Image by the CDC. Scientists are warning the public that ‘unpredictable pandemics’ are possible as viruses spread from animals to humans. The warning comes after a woman was diagnosed with the common strain of bird flu, H6N1 and after an article in The Lancet that talked about a need for “intensive” monitoring of bird flu. Are we monitoring for these potential pandemics? An article published in The Lancet entitled, “Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis” discusses the human infection of H6N1. No one knows when a pandemic will occur or what virus it may be; however, there has been quite the concern over the avian influenza. Experts are also watching the H7N9 virus as a potential to becoming a pandemic. Image by the CDC. There are 16 different avian flu types, but the one that is of the most concern is H5N1. The first H5N1 cause occurred in 2003 and since then there have been 641 cases and 380 deaths in 15 different countries, reports the World Health Organization (WHO). Other strains like the H7N9 is also becoming a concern. According to the WHO, as of October 25, 2013 there have been a total of 137 cases and 45 deaths.

The November 27, 2009 worldwide update by the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 7,820 deaths\". The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, \"opening a new chapter in the global epidemic\". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They \n\nInfluenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) is a subtype of the influenza A virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to \"bird flu\" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, H5N1 pathogenicity is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination, and there is \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission\" of the virus. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008, in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006, and 55 in June 2007. The global HPAI situation significantly improved in the first half of 2008, but the FAO reports that imperfect disease surveillance systems mean that occurrence of the virus remains underestimated and underreported. As of May 2020, the WHO reported a total of 861 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 455 people since 2003. In 2003, world-renowned virologist Robert G. Webster published an article titled \"The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population\" in American Scientist. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives. On September 29, 2005, David Nabarro, the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill anywhere between 5 million and 150 million people. H5N1 may cause more than one influenza pandemic, as it is expected to continue mutating in birds regardless of whether humans develop herd immunity to a future pandemic strain. Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as bad as the Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used. No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu. This means when the H5N1 strain infects humans, it will replicate in the lower respiratory tract, and consequently will cause viral pneumonia. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught avian H5N1. The reported mortality rate of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is high; WHO data indicate 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death. However, there is some evidence the actual mortality rate of avian flu could be much lower, as there may be many people with milder symptoms who do not seek treatment and are not counted. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Other examples include: A/duck/Hong Kong/308/78(H5N3), A/avian/NY/01(H5N2), A/chicken/Mexico/31381-3/94(H5N2), and A/shoveler/Egypt/03(H5N2). Genetic structure and related subtypes\n\nH5N1 is a subtype of the species Influenza A virus of the genus Alphainfluenzavirus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Like all other influenza A subtypes, the H5N1 subtype is an RNA virus. This is where the H and N come from in H5N1. Influenza A viruses are significant for their potential for disease and death in humans and other animals. It is not known to affect humans at all. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. A previously uncontagious strain may then be able to pass between humans, one of several possible paths to a pandemic. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2. Both the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains contained avian influenza virus RNA segments. Daniel R. Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at Georgetown University has made this point, \"There is no H5N1 pandemic so there can be no pandemic vaccine\". Public health\n\n\"The United States is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating avian influenza occurrences. Together steps are being taken to \"minimize the risk of further spread in animal populations\", \"reduce the risk of human infections\", and \"further support pandemic planning and preparedness\". Ongoing detailed mutually coordinated onsite surveillance and analysis of human and animal H5N1 avian flu outbreaks are being conducted and reported by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the European Commission, and others. This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to prepare for a possible H5N1 pandemic. However, WHO expert Hassan al-Bushra has said:\n\"Even now, we remain unsure about Tamiflu's real effectiveness. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Epidemiology\n\nThe earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population in 1997. This panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory. However, the disease has continued to spread; outbreaks were reported in Asia again in 2003. On December 21, 2009 the WHO announced a total of 447 cases which resulted in the deaths of 263. According to a report by the World Health Organization, H5N1 may be spread indirectly. Each specific known genetic variation is traceable to a virus isolate of a specific case of infection. These new isolates caused acute disease, including severe neurological dysfunction and death in ducks. Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. In October 2004, researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic. Three mutations were introduced into the H5N1 virus genome, and the virus was then passed from the noses of infected ferrets to the noses of uninfected ones, which was repeated 10 times. After these 10 passages the H5N1 virus had acquired the ability of transmission between ferrets via aerosols or respiratory droplets. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied (under formal protest) with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal Science devoted to H5N1. Society and culture\n\nH5N1 has had a significant effect on human society, especially the financial, political, social, and personal responses to both actual and predicted deaths in birds, humans, and other animals. Billions of U.S. dollars are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential avian influenza pandemic. Over $10 billion have been spent and over 200 million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. People have reacted by buying less chicken, causing poultry sales and prices to fall. Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic. International health officials and other experts have pointed out that many unknown questions still hover around the disease. Dr. David Nabarro, Chief Avian Flu Coordinator for the United Nations, and former Chief of Crisis Response for the World Health Organization has described himself as \"quite scared\" about H5N1's potential impact on humans. Nabarro has been accused of being alarmist before, and on his first day in his role for the United Nations, he proclaimed the avian flu could kill 150 million people. In an interview with the International Herald Tribune, Nabarro compares avian flu to AIDS in Africa, warning that underestimations led to inappropriate focus for research and intervention.

In one study, Serena Day, M.D., of The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues reported a 436 percent increase in hospital admissions at one medical center between 2012 and 2017 for infective endocarditis related to intravenous drug use. Robert Avram, M.D., of the University of California in San Francisco, and colleagues demonstrated that a smartphone application that measures heart rate using a phone’s camera may help detect vascular changes tied to diabetes. The investigators found that the model correctly identified people suffering from diabetes in more than 72 percent of the cases (sensitivity) using the PPG signal alone. THURSDAY, March 21, 2019 — Only a small proportion of recommendations in major cardiovascular society guidelines are supported by evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or a single large RCT, according to a study published in the March 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. WEDNESDAY, March 20, 2019 — For patients with atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation does not significantly reduce the risk for death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest, but it does improve quality of life versus medical therapy, according to two studies published online March 15 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The research was published to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. The research was published to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. MONDAY, March 18, 2019 — Few patients are optimally adherent to statins, although adherence is associated with a reduced risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. THURSDAY, March 7, 2019 — Patients with myocardial infarction at age 40 years or younger have similar long-term all-cause and cardiovascular death rates as patients aged older than 40 years, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. FRIDAY, March 22, 2019 — Recommendations have been developed for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was published online March 17 in Circulation to coincide with presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. Therefore, it's about 60% likely that you will have some coronary calcification but until the score is determined, the overall predictive significance is nothing more than guesswork. Can the abnormal coronary calcium score be treated? However, a study of 1,005 patients with an abnormal coronary calcium score were treated with aspirin and some with a statin to lower their cholesterol. After four years of treatment, follow-up patients who received a statin had a 7% rate of heart events, such as a heart attack, versus 12% of those which received a placebo. There need to be more studies geared towards determining how the risk can be lowered by specific treatments; however, this study gives a glimpse of the power of finding and treating silent heart disease an early stage. The American College of Cardiology, of which I am a member and Fellow, took a big step forward in 2011 when they commented on coronary calcium CT scans. They released new guidelines for assessment of CV risk in asymptomatic adults. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. \"Because the number of US adults with an intermediate FRS and/or diabetes is substantial, these guidelines mean that many persons should have coronary CT calcium scanning.## \"Bulletproof Your Heart\" Summary\n\n  1.Silent dangerous plaque in heart arteries is almost always calcified\n  2.CT scanners can detect and measure this silent killer in seconds\n  3. Guidelines for treating healthy adults with cholesterol lowering statins “evidence based medicine”? The 2001 guidelines were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. As fate would have it, the findings of a major government-sponsored trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT) were completed and published in JAMA in 2002. “The study found that quadrupling the number of people on statins prevented no more heart disease, nor did it decrease the overall risk of death. The only group that derived any significant benefit from more statins were African Americans, who had fewer episodes of heart disease, but no fewer deaths. Presentation of the ALLHAT findings was delayed; the findings were not presented at the November 2002 meeting of the American Heart Association. In 2011, women got somewhat of a reprieve from aggressive statin intervention; it was no longer recommended to prescribe statins for women with less than a 20% risk of developing heart disease within the next 10 years. The study tested the rationale for prescribing statins to prevent a cardiovascular event in healthy individuals. After a follow-up of one year and nine months, the study was stopped due to the claimed positive results in lowering myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The article claimed the benefit was 20 times greater than the risk of muscle toxicity or diabetes. The data show that the overall risk of death in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease is not significantly reduced by statins. The CTT authors calculate that 91 people need to be treated with a statin for five years in order to prevent one cardiovascular event. The CTT authors relied on data about side-effects from industry clinical trials which have been shown during litigation procedures to understate – or more accurately, to conceal adverse effects. On the other hand, a study that examined population-based health statistics in the U.S. showed that painful muscle symptoms occurred in 53 out of every 1,000 patients treated with statins – 100 times more frequently than had been reported within the clinical trials in the Lancet meta-analysis. “if there is any uncertainty at all about the risks and benefits of statins – and there is – then we have failed to competently implement the most basic principles of evidence based medicine.

One reason is the shift in the source of marijuana supply from foreign to domestic. Growers have learned to manipulate various factors such as lighting, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels to enhance the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in marijuana plants. Changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana also play a role in the perceived increase in potency. Testing artifacts, such as improved testing methods and increased accuracy in measuring THC levels, may contribute to the apparent rise in potency. It's important to note that the potency measurements may not solely reflect the actual increase in THC content but could be influenced by improvements in testing procedures. A study using data from the Potency Monitoring Program found that when adjusting for marijuana quality, the reported increase in THC% between the 1970s and the 2000s is estimated to be about 57-67% as great as initially reported. This suggests that the long-term rise in potency may be slightly overestimated due to data quality issues and the need to account for the quality of the tested marijuana. In conclusion, the increased potency of marijuana in the USA can be attributed to a combination of factors including the shift to domestic cultivation, advancements in cultivation techniques, and changes in testing procedures. There are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Can I use marijuana and go to work?3.I strongly advise my patients to avoid them.I believe the risk of dabbing and the use of strong concentrates, e.g., shatter and wax, far outweighs their benefit, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood.Careful attention to an individual's mental health history, such as a diagnosis of addiction, depression, anxiety, or a mood disorder, or a family history of addiction, should serve as a warning to the possibility of marijuana being a potential problem. These factors need to be taken into account before beginning daily cannabis use for chronic pain, and should be discussed with your physician. Behavioral support has been effective in treating marijuana addiction. Marijuana potency has steadily increased over the past two decades. THC content increased from 3.7 to 7.5 percent in the early 1990s to 9.6 to 16 percent in 2013. With the advent of THC concentrates, such as shatter and wax (see Chapter 4), the addiction potential of marijuana has increased considerably. The highest-potency marijuana flower available today contains at most 25 to 30 percent THC. But the concentrates can contain up to 95 percent or more THC. The effect is so intense and the addiction potential so much greater that they have been described as the \"crack cocaine of marijuana.\" Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain (especially the developing brain) are exposed to extremely high concentrations of THC or whether the recent increases in emergency department visits by people testing positive for marijuana are related to rising potency. There are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Each of us is unique and will respond a bit differently to marijuana.As you'll learn in question 5, the marijuana products most effective for relieving pain are not strongly psychoactive, and the effect of the THC in them is mitigated by both CBD and the pain itself. Cannabis users whose first experience with the drug is with potent “skunk” strains are nearly five times more likely to go on to show signs of dependence, US researchers have said. Researchers found higher concentration of THC, the molecule which causes its psychoactive “high”, increased the likelihood that users would develop cravings or risky drug use that disrupts their day-to-day life. “THC has linearly increased over two decades,” said Dr Brook Arterberry, an assistant professor of psychology at Iowa State University who led this research. Increases in THC content have been made possible because of modern growing techniques and in America average levels have risen from 3.5 per cent THC in 1994 to 12.3 per cent in 2012. In the UK high-potency skunk has pushed out virtually all other types, and experts warn that mental health disorders like psychosis are more common in people who use these stronger strains. In annual follow-ups, users who reported that they had started smoking skunk – with an average THC content of 12.3 per cent – were 4.8 times more likely to have one or more symptoms of cannabis use disorder when compared to those smoking a 4.9 per cent strain. Cannabis is not typically thought of as addictive in the same way as heroin, cocaine, or even alcohol, where withdrawal can have serious physical health effects. In April, HPIL, SAM, and Stephenson High School Students held a press conference highlighting a cost report that found marijuana legalization would cost the state of Illinois upwards of $670 million, far outweighing prospective tax revenues. After this, pro-pot politicians lost traction on their plan and the session ended with no legalization. Earlier in April, pro-pot advocates were ready to declare victory in Connecticut as a bill to legalize marijuana was passed out of committee. Parents and educators across the state weighed in and kept marijuana out of school nurse office when the marijuana industry wanted it. Advocates across the country all came together to push back on Big Marijuana’s attempts to further their addiction-for-profit scheme and together, we notched resounding victories. (Alexandria, VA) - In the past few years, marijuana use is up significantly, by 10%, among 10th graders, and current vaping of marijuana is up 63% for eighth and tenth graders and 53% for twelfth graders, according to new numbers from the largest drug use survey in the United States. Over the past two years, marijuana use among tenth graders rose 10%, a significant increase. Today’s marijuana is especially harmful to adolescents and is known to have a whole host of damaging effects on developing brains. Adolescent marijuana use severely impacts the ability of our youth to learn, greatly increases the risk of serious mental illness, impairs memory, and can even result in a loss of up to eight IQ points. Evidence shows that marijuana – which has skyrocketed in average potency over the past decades - is addictive and harmful to the human brain especially when used by adolescents. In states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes, youth marijuana use, and costs that far outweigh pot revenues.These states have seen a black market that continues to thrive, a black market that continues to thrive, sustained disparities in marijuana arrest rates, and tobacco company investment in marijuana. Pot laced chocolate chip cookies — and other products…..\nPaediatricians are seeing a ‘massive upsurge’ in the number of parents demanding that psychoactive cannabis medicine be prescribed for their epileptic children. Dr Joseph Symonds, a paediatrician at Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Children and research fellow in paediatric epilepsy genetics at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘We have seen a massive upsurge in the number of parents asking for cannabis, and specifically cannabis with THC, because of the media interest around the children who have responded well to it. Though I had consumed our dispensary’s high THC flower, doing a dab was a sensation that I had never attained with marijuana before in my entire life, or from any drug for that matter, including cocaine. For complete article Toxic Cannabis in ALL Food Chains! The metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.THC distributes throughout the body, with THC metabolites depositing in the fat stores of the body.Marijuana produces a dreamy euphoria, which has qualities similar to that of alcohol or opioid intoxication. \"Street\" jargon includes: blunts (hollowed-out cigars packed with marijuana), colas (buds of the cannabis plant, which are preferred by marijuana users because of their higher content of delta-9-THC, the active ingredient in marijuana), and hashish or hash (the most potent form, which comes from the resin of the cannabis plant when it is separated from the plant material). The major or most potent psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is THC. THC is present in marijuana in concentrations from 2–15%. The source of marijuana determines its THC concentration, depending upon the species, growth environment, part of the plant that is harvested, and where it comes from. However, the greater euphoria of higher-potency marijuana can lead to more marijuana use and abuse, as well as more side effects. The most common route of administration of marijuana is smoking, although some is ingested orally in homemade foods (e.g., brownies) or in a pharmaceutical product known as dronabinol (Marinol). When smoked, THC enters the circulation almost immediately, reaching high blood levels in 5–10 minutes. Marijuana produces a dreamy euphoria, which has qualities similar to that of alcohol or opioid intoxication. THC distributes throughout the body, with THC metabolites depositing in the fat stores of the body.

Isbell also investigated dosage effects of THC, and reported that low doses (4–6 mg) produced a pleasurable state (euphoria, perceptual distortion, and change of mood); this dosage was described by subjects as \"good reefer\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It was discovered that Tutankhamun's family had a large number of irregularities. Four of the mummies, including Tutankhamun, were shown to have had malaria. Based on all the data, the study concluded the most likely cause of death for the young king was the combination of avascular necrosis, malaria and a leg fracture. The presence of 130 canes in the tomb was used as evidence to support Hawass's claim that Tutankhamun suffered from a walking impairment. In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture. German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamun's cause of death.

Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in November 2018 allows states to pay for short-term psychiatric care for adults in IMD settings. In addition, states may also seek Medicaid payment for services provided to individuals 21 years of age or younger in settings that do not meet CMS requirements to qualify for the inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 benefit (commonly referred to as the psych under 21 benefit). In order to receive demonstration approval, states must meet several criteria, including providing access to a continuum of mental health services, use of a utilization review entity, and certain provider requirements. Section 1115 SUD demonstration waivers. CMS guidance issued in November 2017 outlines the parameters for states to obtain a Section 1115 waiver to pay for short-term residential SUD treatment in IMDs. Among other things, criteria address coverage of certain outpatient and residential services, provider requirements, and evaluation and reporting milestones. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-271) created a new state plan option to allow states to pay for care for Medicaid beneficiaries age 21–64 with at least one SUD in certain IMDs. In order for a state to receive state plan approval, several requirements must be meant including coverage of outpatient, residential, and inpatient services, as well as maintenance of effort requirements. Current Medicaid regulations indicate when managed care organizations (MCOs) can pay for treatment in IMDs as an in-lieu of service. Medicaid payment for IMD services under this authority is limited to 15 days per month. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 recently codified this provision (or any successor regulation) into statute. State Medicaid programs are statutorily required to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries and other low income patients. States can make DSH payments for uncompensated care costs at IMDs as long as such payments do not exceed the lesser amount of the amount of DSH funds that the state paid IMDs in fiscal year (FY) 1995 or 33 percent of the state’s FY 1995 DSH allotment for all hospitals. In state plan rate year 2014, states made $2.4 billion in DSH payments to IMDs. Maine made DSH payments exclusively to IMDs and four states (Alaska, Connecticut, Maryland, and North Dakota) spent more than half of their DSH allotments on DSH payments to IMDs. Many states are using multiple authorities to pay for services in these settings. he led the effort to do a 1332 waiver to reduce health care costs. On prescription drug relief, Feltes authored the historic legislation to import safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada for New Hampshire seniors. Feltes passed prescription drug relief for senior citizens who fell in the Medicare Part D \"donut hole\". Feltes fought for additional support and enhanced oversight and transparency of nursing homes, including the New Hampshire Veterans Home, advocated for a COVID-19 Workers Bill of Rights to get people back to work safely, and Feltes was among the first in the nation to propose direct relief for frontline workers. In a sweeping reform of children's mental health care, Feltes authored the bipartisan landmark legislation making the largest advancement in children’s mental health care in the history of New Hampshire, including a statewide system \n\n In Arizona, the government can mandate inpatient treatment for anyone determined to be \"persistently or acutely disabled.\" Virtually anyone who suspects that someone has mental problems and needs help could file an application to a state-licensed healthcare agency for a court-ordered evaluation. In Connecticut, someone can be committed only if he or she has \"psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled\". If the court finds that the respondent is \"seriously mentally \n\nWhat is a Crisis Resolution Center? It can serve as a less restrictive and more clinically appropriate treatment option for persons who are in psychiatric crisis but who do not need the medical capabilities of an acute care hospital, and it can result in significant cost savings. Treatment is intended to keep the person safe, stabilize the person’s acute psychiatric symptoms, and return the person to their familiar living situation and treatment as soon as possible. In Oregon, a facility for up to five residents is licensed as a Residential Treatment Home (OAR 309-035-0250). Facilities of six beds or more require licensing as a Residential Treatment Facility (OAR 309-035-0100). These facilities are commonly limited to 16 residents, as this is the maximum number of residents permitted to still qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. The State of Oregon has rules for different “Classes” of facilities (OAR 309-033-0520) based on the level of restriction permitted on the person’s freedom of movement. Class 3 facilities are not locked; admission and discharge are voluntary on the part of the person, and the person must be released upon the person’s request (unless this presents a danger to themselves or others, at which time other legal means must be utilized). Crisis respite stays in Oregon are limited to 30 days by OAR. ColumbiaCare Services takes the “treatment” part of “residential treatment facility” seriously, and does not separate day-to-day operations of the facility from treatment. Close, accessible oversight provided by experienced mental health professionals at the management level help guide these activities and assures quality. ColumbiaCare has worked with persons experiencing severe psychiatric distress and suicidal and homicidal feelings and actions. ColumbiaCare data and experience prove that diverting people from hospitals effectively reduces police involvements in facilities where that has been an issue. Statistics are indicative of this success, given that ColumbiaCare CRCs show a minimum 94% of individuals admitted through referrals from crisis workers, hospital emergency rooms, or law enforcement have been diverted from more restrictive hospital or jail placements. While CRC daily rates may vary according to the specific programming being requested (security level of the facility, professional psychiatric services and staffing level); Crisis Resolution Center bed day rates range from $250 to $500 per day. One very conservative savings example is Wasco County, who by investing in Crisis Resolution Center services saved over $257,000 in just 381 days. ColumbiaCare has been providing a full range of mental health and residential services for citizens of Oregon since its inception in 2003, and has since expanded services into Idaho. ColumbiaCare has extensive history and experience in designing, developing (building or remodeling), and/or operating residential treatment programs including 13 licensed treatment facilities providing 24-hour residential services to adults with a primary diagnosis of mental illness. Prior to forming ColumbiaCare beginning in 1995, the current principles of ColumbiaCare managed the community mental health program in Josephine County, giving them almost 15 years of professional experience developing and providing short- term crisis resolution services. ColumbiaCare is licensed to operate Residential Treatment Homes and Facilities for Adults with Mental Illnesses in 6 Oregon counties (Clackamas, Coos, Curry, Morrow, Multnomah, Wasco)-State of Oregon Addictions and Mental Health Division. ColumbiaCare has a Certificate of Approval to provide Adult Mental Health Outpatient Services in 5 Oregon counties (Clackamas, Coos, Curry, Wasco, Multnomah)-State of Oregon Addictions and Mental Health Division. ColumbiaCare is licensed to provide Secure Transportation Services-State of Oregon. ColumbiaCare sponsors ASIST and RESPONSE programs. We strongly feel that our depth of experience in providing stable living environments, basic daily living support services, milieu therapy, and mental health stabilization services in the short-term setting are only enhanced by our expanded experience with other residential programs and affiliated services.

Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck. Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several potential anti-cancer products. As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released. In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO at the time was Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron and later went on to restart the trial. On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans. Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.\n\n discontinuation of their other Phase 3 clinical trial of Canvaxin in patients with Stage IV melanoma based upon a similar recommendation of the independent DSMB following its review of data from the second interim analysis of this clinical trial.

According to the USDA recommendation for daily caloric intake, a McDonald's meal has more than half a day's worth of calories. In the short term, the residents of these communities are making an economically rational decision when purchasing fast food as it is easily accessible and inexpensive. The alternative would be purchasing low quality groceries at a high cost. In the long-term however, studies show that the consumption of fast food hurts overall \n\n One of CSPI's top goals has been to ensure that consumers have reliable information about what they eat and drink. Since the early 2000s, CSPI has worked with policymakers and advocates in Philadelphia, New York City, California, and numerous other jurisdictions to pass laws to list calories on menus and menu boards. In addition to making calorie information available to consumers, a key benefit of menu labeling has been the reformulation of existing food items and the introduction of nutritionally improved items in many chain restaurants. In 2010, CSPI successfully lobbied for a provision, which was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act, to require calorie labeling on menus at chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments nationwide. The FDA proposed regulations for menu labeling in 2011, and CSPI has since worked to continue to mobilize support for national menu labeling, diffuse opposition from Congress and special interests, and encourage the FDA to strengthen the final regulations and release them in a timely manner. Menu labeling was implemented nationally in 2018. Media attention given to celebrity British chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal, Marco Pierre White and many others with television shows and books encouraging home produced meals may have had a limited short-term impact on the growth of fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King. Other fast food outlets, high street bakeries, and chain coffee shops offering hot drinks with sugar levels over three times the daily recommended limit have nonetheless continued to rapidly expand. A 2015 University of Cambridge study reported that the total number of takeaway restaurants including fried chicken, fish and chips, pizza, kebab, Indian and Chinese takeaway shops has risen by 45% over the preceding 18 years.

It was sold to hometown bank KeyCorp in 1998, but was eventually sold to the U.S. investment arm of Swiss banking giant UBS AG in 2007. Corporate Accountability International (CAI), a group that challenges corporate abuses, posted an open letter on its website asking hospitals that house McDonalds restaurants to end their contracts with the fast food chain to “stop fostering a food environment that promotes harm, not health.” The letter points out that the rates at which children suffer from diet-related illnesses like diabetes are “staggering,” and the problem is related in part to the consumption of junk food. Locating McDonalds stores in hospitals is part of a marketing strategy, CAI says, that is aimed at imparting an aura of healthfulness to the food — a goal that is inconsistent with the goals of a health institution. But these efforts cannot compete with the profit-driven mechanisms by which McDonalds and the fast food industry operate their business, and the toll that McDonalds’ practices have had on children’s health,” the letter states.

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. Taking statins in high doses increases the risk of emergency hospital treatment for kidney damage, warn researchers. They found patients taking high potency statins had a 34 per cent higher risk of being hospitalised for acute kidney injury, compared with those taking low doses. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’. The risk of type 2 diabetes is raised by 12 per cent with high dose statins compared with moderate doses, according to a study. Lead researcher Professor Colin Dormuth, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said further investigation was necessary to determine how statins might be causing kidney injury. It could be due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, or because use of statins can deplete the body's stores of CoQ10, a naturally-occurring nutrient important for energy production in cells. Some studies suggest statins may protect against health problems, including blood clots, Alzheimer's and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain. They may also cut the risk of dying from pneumonia. In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For example, some cyanobacteria can produce alkaloid neuromuscular toxins, which can lead to muscular tremors, stupor, prostration, convulsions, and even death. It is important to be aware of the potential effects of algae poisoning on animals and take necessary precautions to prevent their exposure. ## Algae Poisoning\n\nToxic freshwater algae, characteristically blue-green in colour, are found in summer on lakes in numerous locations, particularly where water has a high phosphate and nitrate content derived from farm land. The main toxic freshwater cyanobacteria are strains of the unicellular Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous forms Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon and Oscillatoria agardhii. Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark. Cyanobacteria poisoning, also known as blue-green algae poisoning, refers to the toxic effects caused by the ingestion or inhalation of cyanobacteria, particularly from contaminated water sources. These toxins can pose a risk to human and animal health. Symptoms of cyanobacteria poisoning can vary depending on the specific toxins produced and the amount ingested. Additionally, exposure to cyanobacteria toxins can cause skin rashes, respiratory irritation, and allergic reactions. Cyanobacteria blooms typically occur in bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that have high levels of nutrients and warm temperatures. To prevent cyanobacteria poisoning, it is important to avoid exposure to potentially contaminated water sources. This includes avoiding swimming or recreating in water bodies with visible cyanobacteria blooms or scum. It is also advised to not use untreated water for drinking, cooking, or any other purpose if cyanobacteria blooms are present or suspected. If you suspect cyanobacteria poisoning after exposure to contaminated water, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks, and research by Linda Lawton, FRSE at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen \n\n Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Guajardo called it a \"surreptitious\" operation that left \"the world naked with no supply of PPE.\" China has also sent tests, equipment, and experts to other countries to help fight the pandemic. Temporary restrictions are sometimes called \"deferrals\", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. With regard to blood donation, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019. Many LGBT organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on homophobia and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously tested to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes. Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection. The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that \"the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood\". In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that \"new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules\". Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as safe sex practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be monogamous, or be in other low risk categories. Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include Isaac Asimov, who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery. Current situation\n\nList of countries with their stand on MSM blood donors \n\nThis list shows countries that had restrictions on blood donors. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor. The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3-month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%. He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004–33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals. The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to \"high risk sexual contact\". The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead. In July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood. New Zealand \nAt the formation of the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS) in 1998, the deferral period had been 10 years, but was reduced to 5 years in 2009. In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to 1 year following the recommendation of Medsafe. Their decision was mainly caused by new information about HIV transmission in Australia which already had a one-year deferral period. United States \nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues donor deferral recommendations to blood establishments. This policy replaces a previous one year deferral that was approved by the FDA on 21 December 2015, which itself replaced a previous lifetime ban on blood donations from MSM. Females are also prohibited from donating for three months after having sex with an MSM. The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. Donors of human cells and tissues other than organs, such as corneas or reproductive tissue like semen, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact. With regard to corneal donations, the five-year deferral policy in the United States and the similar 12-month deferral policy in Canada have the effect of preventing thousands of corneal donations annually. UNOS policies for organ donation allow for solid organs from MSM donors such as hearts, lungs, and kidneys to be used in transplant surgeries, though they require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years. The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease. History of calls to change the policy \n In 2006, the AABB, American Red Cross, and America's Blood Centers all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population.\" Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change. \"The government’s unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation,\" said Higgins. On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months. Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM. Australia \nAustralia implemented a 12-month deferral in 1999; a comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months, however it was rejected by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2014. The spokesperson said they empathise with those who cannot give blood. Reasoning for the restrictions \nBlood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood. Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM due to the marginal increase in the risk for transfusion-transmitted HIV. Other groups with similar restrictions, or complete prohibition to donate blood, due to increased or possible risk for certain infectious diseases include intravenous drug users, recipients of animal organs or tissues, and those who have traveled or lived abroad in certain countries. In the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic outbreak occurred, there was a high prevalence of the disease on MSM and no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from high-risk groups. These restrictions are similar to current restrictions on people with certain residence in the United Kingdom, France, or Saudi-Arabia during the height of the BSE (\"mad cow disease\") epidemic of 1980 through 1996, due to the absence of a test for its human form, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD). An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. Screening out those at high risk of blood borne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents. Criticism of the restrictions\n\nNeed for blood \nObjections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. However, Canadian Blood Services noted that the national inventory and days on hand of several blood groups remain at critically low levels. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Activism regarding reform of MSM donor policies\n\nStudent and faculty activism on campuses \nIn Canada\n The students association at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus. In 2011, the academic senate of Queens College, City University of New York recommended that all blood drives on campus should cease. The Michigan Daily, the student newspaper of the University of Michigan, editorialized in favor of a loosening of the MSM blood donation policy. There were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of Democratic lawmakers urging the ban to be lifted. This resulted in 20 Attorneys General writing to The Department of Health and Human Services asking for the restrictions on MSM blood donations to be lifted. In the United Kingdom\n\n The National Union of Students LGBT Campaign runs a \"Donation Not Discrimination\" campaign to have the blood ban changed, while also advocating continued donation by those who are not banned from donating. United Kingdom \nIn 2015, Welsh writer and poet RJ Arkhipov exhibited a poetry series written with his own blood as ink in protest of the MSM blood donor restrictions. Court cases \nIn 2018 the European Court of Human Rights took up a case of a French citizen who was prevented from donating blood.

In the United Kingdom\n\n The National Union of Students LGBT Campaign runs a \"Donation Not Discrimination\" campaign to have the blood ban changed, while also advocating continued donation by those who are not banned from donating. United Kingdom \nIn 2015, Welsh writer and poet RJ Arkhipov exhibited a poetry series written with his own blood as ink in protest of the MSM blood donor restrictions. Court cases \nIn 2018 the European Court of Human Rights took up a case of a French citizen who was prevented from donating blood.

Temporary restrictions are sometimes called \"deferrals\", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. With regard to blood donation, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019. Many LGBT organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on homophobia and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously tested to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes. Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection. The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that \"the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood\". In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that \"new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules\". Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as safe sex practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be monogamous, or be in other low risk categories. Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include Isaac Asimov, who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery. Current situation\n\nList of countries with their stand on MSM blood donors \n\nThis list shows countries that had restrictions on blood donors. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor. The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3-month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%. He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004–33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals. The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to \"high risk sexual contact\". The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead. In July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood. New Zealand \nAt the formation of the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS) in 1998, the deferral period had been 10 years, but was reduced to 5 years in 2009. In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to 1 year following the recommendation of Medsafe. Their decision was mainly caused by new information about HIV transmission in Australia which already had a one-year deferral period. United States \nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues donor deferral recommendations to blood establishments. This policy replaces a previous one year deferral that was approved by the FDA on 21 December 2015, which itself replaced a previous lifetime ban on blood donations from MSM. Females are also prohibited from donating for three months after having sex with an MSM. The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. Donors of human cells and tissues other than organs, such as corneas or reproductive tissue like semen, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact. With regard to corneal donations, the five-year deferral policy in the United States and the similar 12-month deferral policy in Canada have the effect of preventing thousands of corneal donations annually. UNOS policies for organ donation allow for solid organs from MSM donors such as hearts, lungs, and kidneys to be used in transplant surgeries, though they require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years. The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease. History of calls to change the policy \n In 2006, the AABB, American Red Cross, and America's Blood Centers all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population.\" Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change. \"The government’s unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation,\" said Higgins. On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months. Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM. Australia \nAustralia implemented a 12-month deferral in 1999; a comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months, however it was rejected by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2014. The spokesperson said they empathise with those who cannot give blood. Reasoning for the restrictions \nBlood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood. Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM due to the marginal increase in the risk for transfusion-transmitted HIV. Other groups with similar restrictions, or complete prohibition to donate blood, due to increased or possible risk for certain infectious diseases include intravenous drug users, recipients of animal organs or tissues, and those who have traveled or lived abroad in certain countries. In the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic outbreak occurred, there was a high prevalence of the disease on MSM and no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from high-risk groups. These restrictions are similar to current restrictions on people with certain residence in the United Kingdom, France, or Saudi-Arabia during the height of the BSE (\"mad cow disease\") epidemic of 1980 through 1996, due to the absence of a test for its human form, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD). To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. Screening out those at high risk of blood borne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents. Criticism of the restrictions\n\nNeed for blood \nObjections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. However, Canadian Blood Services noted that the national inventory and days on hand of several blood groups remain at critically low levels. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Activism regarding reform of MSM donor policies\n\nStudent and faculty activism on campuses \nIn Canada\n The students association at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus. In 2011, the academic senate of Queens College, City University of New York recommended that all blood drives on campus should cease. The Michigan Daily, the student newspaper of the University of Michigan, editorialized in favor of a loosening of the MSM blood donation policy. There were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of Democratic lawmakers urging the ban to be lifted. This resulted in 20 Attorneys General writing to The Department of Health and Human Services asking for the restrictions on MSM blood donations to be lifted.

Researchers believe that a blood test may be helpful in determining whether a child has sustained a concussion, as well as determining ithe severity of the problem. A new study found that a blood test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) 94 percent of the time. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. During the study, researchers performed CT scans on 152 children in the study while comparing the results of the scans with results from the blood tests. While the CT scans helped to identify which patients suffered visible TBIs, the blood test also detected the symptoms of concussions even when the brain injuries were not visible on CT scans. As it stands, most children with concussions are diagnosed by symptoms alone. Typically, these are observed via vomitting or balance problems or can be reported by the child through headache, blurred vision or feeling groggy. However, these do not really give doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury. Is There A Link Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Road Rage? MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test appeared to detect signs of concussion up a week after patients suffered a head injury, researchers report. \"This [blood test] could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly,\" she added in a news release from the Florida health care provider. In nearly 600 patients age 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussion with up to 97 percent accuracy, the researchers said. \"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa, a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded researcher. An estimated 250,000 U.S. children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports -- nearly 700 a day. As a result, it can be difficult for doctors to determine the severity of the injury, Papa said. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. EEG, CT or MRI, CSF examination, and measles serologic testing are done. Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination by lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap), brain imaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological testing and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Confine your pet or otherwise make sure it does not run away. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Vaccination of all dogs, cats and ferrets on the premises protects them from the risk of rabies. Bats accounted for six of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1999. Rabies from bats is the most common source of human infection in the United States. Contact your veterinarian or local animal control personnel for information. Your local health department has proper containers and instructions for submitting an animal specimen for rabies testing. Most fatalities from rabies occur when people fail to seek prompt medical assistance or are unaware of the exposure, as with some of the cases associated with bat rabies. Many countries have a much higher risk of rabies exposure than the United States. In 1998, four cases of rabies in horses were confirmed in Kentucky. Proper and up-to-date vaccination of your pets is your first line of defense against rabies. Recently the Toronto Public Health Services received confirmation of this year’s first positive rabid bat in Hamilton. I am writing this blog regarding rabies in bats, raccoons and other wildlife so you will know what prevention steps to take, learn about the symptoms, steps to take if you are bitten and not to panic! In Canada, common carriers of rabies are bats, raccoon, skunk and foxes. Recently the most human-rabies cases have been contracted by rabies in bats. There are several strains presently in Ontario, there are skunk and fox strains, raccoon strains and bats have several strains. If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. The bait contains a rabies vaccine that is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. In humans early symptoms is numbness or itchiness around the bite area, flu like symptoms and headache progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance. As a precaution, all bites or scratches by raccoons should be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Raccoons may incubate rabies for long periods (months) without becoming ill. Don’t attract raccoons to your property, consider feeding pets indoors, not over filling bird feeders, cleaning up well after BBQ’s and keeping bins securely closed. Rabid bats accounted for 27 of the 28 rabies cases in 2013. As bats in Canada are insectivores, no efficient way of vaccinating them has yet been found. Local or state health officials should be consulted to help determine if rabies treatment is needed. Ontario law requires that all dogs and cats be vaccinated against rabies and their shots kept up-to-date. To further protect your pets, keep them indoors at night to limit their exposure, the time when foxes, skunks, bats and raccoons are most active. If you encounter a rabid animal keep your distance and call the Rabies Hotline at 1-888-574-6656. Here are some tips on preventing wildlife on your property. If you have more questions, visit Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources downloadable “Common questions and answers for rabies” PDF. WELD COUNTY, Colo. — In recent months, five skunks have tested positive for rabies near the Colorado towns of Severance, Pierce, and Grover. Some animal and human exposures have occurred, and they all are receiving treatment. Four people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis after handling their pets which encountered the skunks. A total of 14 dogs were also exposed. Health officials continue to educate the public about preventing rabies exposure. \"Rabies can infect any mammal,\" said Mark E. Wallace, MD, MPH, executive director of the Weld County Health Department. In past years, domestic bison and horses have contracted rabies, in addition to a variety of wildlife. \"The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated. If you are in direct contact with a rabid animal, such as a skunk or bat, your risk is much higher,\" Wallace said. Rabies can infect many wild animals, including skunks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and bats. Health officials recommend all domestic animals such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. PROGRAM GOAL: To prevent human cases of rabies by investigating all reported animal bites, and by vaccinating dogs against rabies. The present raccoon rabies epidemic was first confirmed in the Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern states in 1977, and has continued to spread to other states. Hundreds of animal bites are reported in Wayne County each year. Any warm-blooded animal can contract the illness; however, typical wildlife rabies is spread by raccoons, skunks, bats, and fox. In past few years several rabid animals (all bats) have been found in Wayne County. Infected wild animals can pass rabies to pets. Animals which are very rarely affected are rats, mice, squirrels, hamsters, and rabbits. Fortunately, few human cases of rabies are reported (1 case in Ohio since 1970 and 32 cases in the U.S. since 1980). How do I know an Animal is Rabid? Animals who exhibit unusual or abnormal behavior should be considered a risk. Rabid animals may stagger, appear restless, change the tone of their bark or growl, appear to be choking, or become excitable/irritable or aggressive. If bitten or scratched, see your doctor and report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District. Report contacts between your pets and wild animals to your veterinarian. If it can be done safely, try to detain or hold the animal, so it can be quarantined/tested for rabies. Report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District and provide the following information using this Bite Report Form. There is still no cure for rabies once symptoms develop. The disease can be stopped in people, if a series of rabies immunizations are given soon after the exposure to the virus. Yet rabies is still around, present in many mammals, including raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes, and contact with any infected animal can mean infection for you or an unvaccinated furry pet. To make people more aware of the continued threat and precautions to take, national and international health organizations have designated September 28, 2011, as World Rabies Day. Vaccination could reduce or eliminate this risk, and a goal of the World Rabies Day campaign is to ensure more widespread vaccination of dogs. Remember, above all, keep your pets vaccinated against rabies, and stay away from wild animals, especially those known to carry the virus. Rabies transmission from dogs to humans has been known since ancient times. The boy lived and did not develop rabies. Even today, with widespread vaccine campaigns targeting domestic pets, rabies persists in some wild populations, such as bats, where infection rates run about 6%. Where bats occur, health officials struggle to keep the public informed, warning that no bat should ever be touched or handled because of the risk of rabies transmission. One study found that 46% of rabies-related bites came from bats, and the huge majority of these infectious bites occur during the summer months. Other wild animals that carry rabies include foxes, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes. It’s pretty straightforward to avoid contracting rabies, but children in particular need to be educated about the rules: avoid contact with all wild animals known to transmit the disease, including bats, foxes, coyotes, and skunks. Never touch or approach an injured animal, and if you have a domesticated pet, such as a dog or cat, be sure that Spot or Fifi is completely up to date on all vaccines.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20 million on feral pig management. In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents). The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti. SCWDS enlisted the use of American and Haitian hog-hunting dogs to reduce the populations.

Michigan State University also investigated the source of the kidney failure and made available to researchers and veterinarians pictures and photographs of affected animal kidneys \"demonstrating acute tubular necrosis in the kidney with intratubular crystals.\" On 27 March, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the symptoms described in affected animals are not \"fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin.\" To reduce the risk of their animals being infected with this disease, farmers used to shoot desert warthogs. Therefore, only 1.1% of badgers killed by free shooting were tested for humaneness of shooting.

However, women who take Actos for type 2 diabetes not only are at risk for bladder cancer but are also at risk for fractures known as secondary osteoporosis. Type 2 diabetes is manageable with a complementary prescription drug and nutrition. But bladder cancer and bone fractures? At the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, their study aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with thiazolidinedione therapy and to evaluate the effect on bone density. Interpretation: Long-term thiazolidinedione use doubles the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. In yet another study, there was evidence that both the TZD class of drugs causes bone loss and increase fracture risk, specifically in women. Observational studies using data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort reported that older postmenopausal TZD users experience bone loss at the rate of -0.61% annually compared with non-TZD users. Improvement of bone safety of TZD-based therapy may be achieved by using combination therapy with other anti-diabetic therapies, or preventing bone loss by using available anti-osteoporotic drugs, or development of a new class of selective TZDs, which may have sparing or even beneficial effects on skeleton. Women beware of Actos, bladder cancer, and bone fractures. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?However, the study period for the clinical trials using TZD drugs was short—four years or less. **MEN, TOO?The female subjects were in their midfifties and had been diagnosed with diabetes for two years or less. Fractures are now listed on the Avandia prescribing information under _Warnings and Precautions:_ \"Increased incidence of bone fracture in female patients.\" **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients. Women, but not men, receiving Actos (pioglitazone) had a higher number of fractures. Increased fracture risk observed in women is now included in the Actos prescribing information under _Precautions._ The full prescribing label includes additional information about fractures that was gathered during the PROACTIVE study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events). Over an almost-three-year period, women with type 2 diabetes taking Actos had double the number of fractures compared to women on placebo. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs.Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients.

Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. In just a matter of a few months, these changes were measured indirectly with bone turnover markers in women. Their markers for building-bone osteoblasts were decreased while markers of bone breakdown were normal. This finding is based on lab mice, but further research in this important area is underway.In a reanalysis of data from a Fosamax trial, it was determined that postmenopausal diabetic women tended to not gain as much bone density as nondiabetics taking Fosamax.Also of note, the diabetics in the placebo group lost bone more rapidly at the hip.Research is needed to guide the design of strategies for improving diabetics' bone health. The authors of the same analysis recommended that other blood sugar lowering agents be considered in people with other risk factors for bladder cancer such as cigarette smoking, family history, or exposure to certain forms of chemotherapy. Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120 Hz (twice of the utility frequency; the lamp is lit on both the positive and negative half-wave of a cycle). This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. SCENIHR study and report\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:\nUltraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. The inner-ear condition Ménière's disease can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of vertigo are recommended to not use fluorescent lights. Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleaned up. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer.

The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines,[dead link] and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences. ^ \"Flickering Fallacy: The Myth of Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb Headaches\". \"The impact of flicker from fluorescent lighting on well-being, performance and physiological arousal\". \"The effects of fluorescent and incandescent illumination upon repetitive behaviors in autistic children\". Although the carcinogenic UV dose from fluorescent lighting in offices is minor (~ 1%) when compared to equal exposure times in the summer sun, old risk assessments showed that actual annual exposures of office workers could increase by 10 to 30% from the fluorescent lighting, which over a lifetime was estimated to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinomas by around 4% with a baseline risk much lower than that for outdoor workers who dominate incidences (Lytle et al. \"Fluorescent light photosensitivity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus\". However as reported regularly by Migraine Action, there are concerns - voiced by many members - that the new bulbs can cause migraines. ^ \"Low-energy bulbs 'cause migraine'\". ^ \"Phasing out 100W lightbulbs 'could damage health of Britons'\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition. People with COPD are recommended by a number of guidelines to have a pneumococcal vaccination. Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles. Prof. Dr. Jyotsna Joshi asserts the importance of preventive adult vaccinations, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination and also throws light on the schedule for dual vaccination. Physicians treating adult patients have poor awareness of preventive vaccinations. Nevertheless, vaccination is an important aspect of management of respiratory disorders and reduces morbidity and mortality. Adult Respiratory Vaccination, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is very important and physicians need to be aware of these. This article emphasises the adult respiratory vaccinations, that are given to prevent respiratory diseases or exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. The two main vaccinations in this group consist of pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. The recommendations are largely based on Advisory Committee on Vaccination Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia and invasive disease such as bacteraemia and meningitis, are important sources of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children, older adults (≥65 years of age), and persons with conditions that affect their ability to make antibodies to capsular polysaccharides. Patients with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with conditions such as heart failure are more likely to have adverse outcomes if pneumonia occurs. Asplenia greatly increases the risk for overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, and a cerebrospinal fluid leak or a cochlear implant greatly increases the risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are approved for use. PPSV is used in selected adults and children ≥2 years of age but not in infants or toddlers <2 years of age since polysaccharide antigens are poorly immunogenic in this age group. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been recommended for many years in for all adults ≥65 years of age and in younger patients who have a condition that increases the risk for developing pneumococcal pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease and/or fatal complications if such infections occur. HIV infection), a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a cochlear implant, or advanced kidney disease. Even if they have not been diagnosed with one of the conditions listed above, they have proven themselves to be susceptible and, therefore, worthy of receiving the vaccine. The CDC recommends 2 pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older irrespective of disease or immune status. Administration: Both pneumococcal vaccines are administered as a 0.5 ml dose. Administration with other vaccines: Either formulation of pneumococcal vaccine may be given concomitantly with other vaccines. This recommendation is in accord with some European public health agency recommendations. Revaccination with PCV13 is not recommended for any age group. Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons without contraindications aged 6 months or older. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. CDC estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Adults with certain health conditions including heart disease, asthma, COPD, diabetes, a liver or kidney disorder, or a weakened immune system are at especially high-risk for influenza and its complications. Trivalent vaccines include an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and one influenza B virus. Persons aged 65 years or older may receive any age-appropriate IIV formulation (standard dose (SD) or high dose (HD), trivalent or quadrivalent) and vaccination should not be delayed if a specific product is not readily available. If the vaccine recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. If nasal congestion impedes delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral should be considered, or another age appropriate vaccine should be administered. The ACIP continues to advise that individuals with a history of egg allergy of any severity may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV4 or LAIV4). However, it is contraindicated in people who have experienced a severe (life threatening) allergy to a prior dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV). Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older. Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients. Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use. There is strong evidence for vaccinating children under the age of 2 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). A Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is available for adults, and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive \n\n or healthcare-associated pneumonia. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While there's a perception that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, that's not the case. \"We have no way to predict how an individual patient with schizophrenia is going to respond to treatment,\" Malhotra said. \"Essentially, we use a trial-and-error approach to treatment choices.\" Patients may remain psychotic, leading to more costs and devastating consequences such as suicide. In the new study, Malhotra and colleagues at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., used functional-MRI brain scans to develop a measurement of how well two regions of the brain communicate with each other. The researchers tried out the strategy on a group of 41 patients, aged 15 to 40, experiencing their first \"psychotic break.\" Using information gained from that trial, the researchers tested their technique in 40 patients hospitalized for psychotic illness. Seventy-six percent of the time, the investigators successfully predicted the response of the second group of patients to drug treatments. \"We were close to these goals with the current work and are now looking to launch additional research in this area to hopefully increase this signal to those levels,\" said Malhotra. Clinical assessment of schizophrenia is carried out by a mental health professional based on observed behavior, reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms \nFirst-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms:\n\nDSM-5 \nThe definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes:\n\nSubtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities \nPeople with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology \nThe pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. When these cells become inflamed, they produce nitric oxide and amino acids, contributing to neuronal death. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood. Environment\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the environmental risks associated with schizophrenia diagnosis. Those who live in urban areas are at a greater risk of diagnosis  Although  environmental factors may increase the risk, encouraging and supportive communities may decrease the likelihood of schizophrenia. However, epigenetics plays a role in the diagnosis of Schizophrenia as well. Differential diagnosis\n\nIf signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. A general medical and neurological examination may also be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and the Lewy body dementias may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. Currently, no biomarkers that can be widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of schizophrenia have been identified. Structural alterations have, however, been identified in schizophrenia, most commonly enlarged ventricles, and decreased grey matter volume in the cortex and hippocampus. Studies using functional MRI have also shown that altered connectivity and activity in present in schizophrenia. In the last decade interest has grown in the use of machine learning to automatically perform the diagnosis task using brain imaging data. While these algorithms are very robust at distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects, they still cannot perform the tasks clinicians struggle the most with - differential diagnosis and treatment selection. Since the prevalence of metabolic syndromes is increased in schizophrenia patients, makers of those syndromes have been common targets of research. These effects are generally small, however, and often present only in a subset of patients, which results from the heterogeneity of the disease. Furthermore, these results are often complicated by the metabolic side effects of anti-psychotic medication. Genetic \nEstimates of the heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. Although many genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, their effects are usually very small, so they are combined onto a polygenic risk score. These scores, despite accounting for hundreds of variants, only explain up to 6% in symptom variation and 7% of the risk for developing the disease. An example of a well-studied genetic biomarker in schizophrenia is the single nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is part of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. This approach appears consistent with research on schizotypy, and with a relatively high prevalence of psychotic experiences, mostly non-distressing delusional beliefs, among the general public. Diagnostic criteria \nNancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. In the same vein, Ming Tsuang and colleagues argue that psychotic symptoms may be a common end-state in a variety of disorders, including schizophrenia, rather than a reflection of the specific etiology of schizophrenia, and warn that there is little basis for regarding DSM's operational definition as the \"true\" construct of schizophrenia. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. The National Institute of Health's Research of Domain Criteria (RDoC) research program, launched in 2009, is perhaps the largest combined effort to address the need for a new approach in classifying mental disorders. These initiatives encourage researchers to consider diagnosis as dimensional, instead of a clear-cut between patients and healthy subjects, and to cut across diagnostic boundaries. The goal is to develop biologically valid diagnosis by defining nosology based on biological measures instead of symptom profiles, as is done currently.

Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. The National Institute of Health's Research of Domain Criteria (RDoC) research program, launched in 2009, is perhaps the largest combined effort to address the need for a new approach in classifying mental disorders. These initiatives encourage researchers to consider diagnosis as dimensional, instead of a clear-cut between patients and healthy subjects, and to cut across diagnostic boundaries. The goal is to develop biologically valid diagnosis by defining nosology based on biological measures instead of symptom profiles, as is done currently. References \n\nSchizophrenia\nPsychiatry controversies\nPsychiatric assessment\n\nThe diagnosis of schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, is based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Clinical assessment of schizophrenia is carried out by a mental health professional based on observed behavior, reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. In other words, an individual does not have to be experiencing delusions or hallucinations to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms \nFirst-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms:\n\nDSM-5 \nThe definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes:\n\nSubtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities \nPeople with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology \nThe pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. When these cells become inflamed, they produce nitric oxide and amino acids, contributing to neuronal death. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood. Environment\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the environmental risks associated with schizophrenia diagnosis. Those who live in urban areas are at a greater risk of diagnosis  Although  environmental factors may increase the risk, encouraging and supportive communities may decrease the likelihood of schizophrenia. However, epigenetics plays a role in the diagnosis of Schizophrenia as well. Differential diagnosis\n\nIf signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. A general medical and neurological examination may also be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and the Lewy body dementias may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. Currently, no biomarkers that can be widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of schizophrenia have been identified. Structural alterations have, however, been identified in schizophrenia, most commonly enlarged ventricles, and decreased grey matter volume in the cortex and hippocampus. Studies using functional MRI have also shown that altered connectivity and activity in present in schizophrenia. In the last decade interest has grown in the use of machine learning to automatically perform the diagnosis task using brain imaging data. While these algorithms are very robust at distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects, they still cannot perform the tasks clinicians struggle the most with - differential diagnosis and treatment selection. Since the prevalence of metabolic syndromes is increased in schizophrenia patients, makers of those syndromes have been common targets of research. These effects are generally small, however, and often present only in a subset of patients, which results from the heterogeneity of the disease. Furthermore, these results are often complicated by the metabolic side effects of anti-psychotic medication. Genetic \nEstimates of the heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. Although many genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, their effects are usually very small, so they are combined onto a polygenic risk score. These scores, despite accounting for hundreds of variants, only explain up to 6% in symptom variation and 7% of the risk for developing the disease. An example of a well-studied genetic biomarker in schizophrenia is the single nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is part of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. This approach appears consistent with research on schizotypy, and with a relatively high prevalence of psychotic experiences, mostly non-distressing delusional beliefs, among the general public. Diagnostic criteria \nNancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. In the same vein, Ming Tsuang and colleagues argue that psychotic symptoms may be a common end-state in a variety of disorders, including schizophrenia, rather than a reflection of the specific etiology of schizophrenia, and warn that there is little basis for regarding DSM's operational definition as the \"true\" construct of schizophrenia.

Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics\nThe therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Heart and blood vessels\n\nVIGOR study and publishing controversy\nThe VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks). Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\". The Journal stated that NEJMs \"ambiguous\" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; \"the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected.\" Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information. The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to CV risk. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. FDA position\nIn 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Litigation\nBy March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.

The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to CV risk. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. FDA position\nIn 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Litigation\nBy March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.

Merck & Co., (5 Nov 2004). Published in The Lancet on Nov. 5. (1 Feb. 2001) Review of cardiovascular safety database. It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics\nThe therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Heart and blood vessels\n\nVIGOR study and publishing controversy\nThe VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks). Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\".

Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it. Historically, abortions have been attempted using \n\n 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

New strategies may be able to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia among older adults, according to background information in the article. Accurate methods of identifying which people are at high risk for dementia in old age would help physicians determine who could benefit from these interventions. However, previous research has not addressed whether measuring atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict the onset of AD at an earlier stage, before cognitive symptoms appear. Tom den Heijer, M.D., Ph.D., of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues used MRI to assess the brain volumes of 511 dementia-free elderly people who were part of the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based cohort study that began in 1990. They screened the participants for dementia at initial visits in 1995 and 1996 and then in follow-up visits between 1997 and 2003, during which they asked about memory problems and performed extensive neuropsychological testing. The authors also monitored the medical records of all participants. During the follow-up, 35 participants developed dementia and 26 were diagnosed with AD. People with severe amygdalar or hippocampal atrophy had the highest risk of developing dementia or AD over the course of the study, which followed participants for an average period of six years. \"Concerning the extent of atrophy, we found in those destined to develop dementia volume reductions between 17 percent and 5 percent, depending on how long before the diagnosis of dementia the MRI was conducted,\" the authors report. \"In persons with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, volume reductions compared with healthy elderly persons are between 25 percent and 40 percent, suggesting that atrophy rates accelerate in patients with Alzheimer disease.\" \"However, we must bear in mind that most people with atrophy did not develop dementia, even after six years. Further prospective population studies are therefore required to find additional biomarkers, including other brain imaging parameters, that alone or in combination with clinical and genetic characteristics can help separate those who are at risk for developing dementia from those who are not.\" \"Reduced Brain Volume May Predict Dementia In Healthy Elderly People.\" Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, and affects as many as 5.1 million Americans. In Alzheimer’s disease, a protein fragment called beta-amyloid accumulates at abnormally high levels in the brain. In the the most common type of Alzheimer’s disease, late-onset Alzheimer’s, symptoms usually appear after age 65. Elderly people with visual disorders that are left untreated are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease — the most common form of dementia, according to a University of Michigan Health System study. The study appears online ahead of print in the American Journal of Epidemiology and may draw a new picture of poor vision as predictor of dementia rather than as a symptom after the diagnosis. “Visual problems can have serious consequences and are very common among the elderly, but many of them are not seeking treatment,” says lead author Mary A.M. Rogers, Ph.D, research assistant professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School and research director of the Patient Safety Enhancement Program at the U-M Health System and the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center. ”Our results indicate that it is important for elderly individuals with visual problems to seek medical attention so that the causes of the problems can be identified and treated,” Rogers says. These include reading, playing board games, other mentally stimulating activities, social networking, as well as physical activity such as walking and routine exercising. According to a survey conducted by the National Eye Health Education Program, less than 11 percent of respondents understood that there are no early warning signs for eye problems such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. The study was based on the surveys and medical information from 625 people compiled from 1992-2005. Approximately 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease and the number has doubled since 1980. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied a large database, collected in the US, of patients with Alzheimer’s or memory complaints who had MRI scans and had spinal taps to collect cerebrospinal fluid, which is in the brain and spinal chord. By examining the CFS they could measure the amounts of the substances that make p plaques and tangles, and related this to brain atrophy. They found that the amount of plaque and tangle-producing chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid correlated with brain tissue loss in selective regions of the brain which are typically affected in Alzheimer’s disease. These regions are important for memory and are typically active when the brain is at rest. A 20-year study by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center has found that a simple blood test may identify people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. Conversely, a decline of Aß42 in the bloodstream may signal the compartmentalization or “traffic jam” of Aß42 in the brain, which occurs in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. They deduce that Aß42 trapped in the brain could account for the decrease in levels post-dementia. Richard Mayeux, M.D., M.S., professor of neurology, psychiatry, and epidemiology, and co-director of the Taub Institute of Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and the Aging Brain at CUMC, led the Northern Manhattan study, and compares findings finding to something similar seen in heart attack patients, who typically have elevated lipid levels in their bloodstream prior to a heart attack, but decreased post-heart attack lipid levels. While the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer’s can be monitored throughout the disease course, clinicians have had no reliable way to monitor the pathologic progression of the disease. Earlier detection would of course be an important step in combating the disease, researchers said. A new study finds that a decline in older people’s’ mental abilities starts years before death, even if they do not have dementia. Perceptual speed starts deteriorating some 15 years before death, spatial ability starts failing nearly 8 years before death, and verbal ability about 6.5 years before death. These findings came out of a study using 288 people without dementia, who were monitored from age 70 to death, with an average age at death of 84. Their mental skills were checked up to 12 times over a 30-year period, to ensure they did not have dementia. Source: Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, August 27, 2008, online edition. The study used a sample of 3,660 men and women aged 65 or older and subjected them to brain scans to look for silent brain infarcts, stroke or dementia. Research shows that silent brain infarcts, which are only detected by brain scans, are found in about 20 percent of otherwise healthy elderly people. The risk of Alzheimer’s disease is nearly doubled among people who have had a stroke, and researchers at Columbia University Medical Center have found a process in the brain that explains the connection. \"This finding connects the dots between p25 and increased production of amyloid beta, and this p25/cdk5 pathway could explain why the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is significantly higher following a stroke,\" said Dr. Duff, professor of pathology (in psychiatry and in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and the Aging Brain) at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Duff’s laboratory is currently working on experiments to verify this pathway’s involvement using human post-mortem tissue of stroke patients. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease typically found in people over the age of 65 years. Worldwide, approximately 24 million people have dementia; 60% of these cases are due to Alzheimer's. The clinical sign of Alzheimer's is progressive cognition deterioration. She is a specialist in neurodegenerative diseases. In 2014, she was elected van Geest Professor of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and in 2017 was awarded the Cambridge Centre of UK Dementia Research Institute of which she is the director. They aim to translate this research into new treatments for dementia. Having identified a major pathway that leads to brain cell death in mice, scientists have now found two drugs that block that pathway and prevent neurodegeneration, with minimal side effects in rodents. We could know in 2-3 years whether this approach can slow down disease progression, which would be a very exciting first step in treating these disorders. We now need to find out whether giving the drug to patients at an early stage could help arrest or slow down the disease through its effects on this pathway.” It is known that misfolded proteins build up in the brains of those with neurodegenerative diseases and are a major factor in dementias such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as prion disease. But in a study published in Brain, the researchers revealed how they identified a number of suitable candidates after testing 1,040 compounds from the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, initially in worms, which have a functioning nervous system. Testing on mice with prion disease and a form of familial tauopathy or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) identified two drugs that restored the protein production rate. Misfolded proteins build up in the brain in several neurodegenerative diseases and are a major factor in dementias such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as prion diseases. They then found switching protein production back on with an experimental drug halted neurodegeneration. This revealed a number of suitable candidate compounds that could then be tested in mouse models of prion disease and a form of familial tauopathy (frontotemporal dementia - FTD), both of which had been protected by the experimental - but toxic - compounds in the team's previous studies. Both drugs prevented the emergence of signs of brain cell damage in most of the prion-diseased mice and restored memory in the FTD mice. We could know in 2-3 years whether this approach can slow down disease progression, which would be a very exciting first step in treating these disorders. They show that a treatment approach originally discovered in mice with prion disease might also work to prevent the death of brain cells in some forms of dementia. “The drug blocks a natural defense mechanism in cells which is overactive in the brains of people with frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, so has the potential to work for several conditions.

Prior to her death she had indicated that she would not like to be kept artificially alive if brain dead. The fetus had suffered from oxygen deprivation and was suspected to be non-viable. The fetus' lower extremities were deformed to the extent that the gender couldn't be \n\nA Baptist seminary leader joined a special panel at Loyola University New Orleans to discuss end-of-life cases that have sparked national debate. The group covered the cases of Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl placed on a ventilator following complications from tonsil and nasal surgery, and Marlise Munoz, a young mother declared brain dead but kept on life support for two months for the sake of her 14-week-old fetus. Popik cited a study by the American Academy of Neurology that indicated, while the protocol for declaring brain death varies widely from state to state and hospital to hospital, an average hospital determines brain death as many as 50 times a year. Brain death is the total and irreversible cessation of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and is determined by a complete examination using a set of diagnostic criteria and not by a single test, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG), White explained. “The science of brain death is very good. Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12, 2013, after three neurologists confirmed she was unable to breathe on her own, had no blood flow to her brain, and showed no sign of electrical activity in the brain. When McMath’s family refused to remove the ventilator, a legal agreement was eventually forced requiring that a death certificate be issued by the Alameda County, Calif., coroner’s office before the patient was moved to an undisclosed facility where life support continues. White said families sometimes have trouble accepting a doctor’s verdict because a patient on life support has a heartbeat, breathes and feels warm to the touch. Wilde added that the issue is compounded in today’s society because death is often not discussed. Lemke agreed, saying families used to care for patients in their final days at home and watched their loved ones struggle for longer periods of time. “We’re isolated and insulated from the reality of death, so when death comes it is all-the-more shocking and we are all-the-more ill-prepared for it,” Lemke said. A judge ruled in his favor on Jan. 24, 2014, stating that the fetus was abnormal and not viable, and that women had a right to end pregnancies if they wished. While the law seeks to balance the rights of individuals, Popik argued the mother’s rights were extinguished when she was pronounced brain dead. According to a Jan. 28, 2014 NPR article reporting on the case, the authors of the bill “intended to keep a pregnant woman who was in a persistent vegetative state on a ventilator until she could deliver, but not a dead pregnant woman,” and insisted the hospital had misinterpreted the law. While the Munoz case was in the news earlier this year, a similar story previously unfolded in Canada. Robyn Benson of British Columbia was declared brain dead at 22 weeks into her pregnancy. Life support continued and her healthy but premature son was delivered at 27 weeks. Benson died the next day. Analysts of the Munoz and Benson cases point out that the hospital had declared the Munoz fetus not viable, while the Benson fetus was determined to be normal. Allowing organ donation is a separate issue but should be expressed in an advanced directive. Maternal somatic support after brain death occurs when a brain dead patient is pregnant and their body is kept alive to deliver a fetus. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age. Past cases \n\nIn the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\" Life support complications \n\nThroughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\" However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into preterm births indicates that \"a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. Brain death vs. similar conditions \n\nIt is important to understand the similarities and differences between brain death and two other conditions: persistent vegetative state and coma. Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state \n\nPatients in a persistent vegetative state \"are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non-purposeful; they do not speak.\" The difference between the two states is that brain death means \"death of the brainstem\" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means \"permanent and total loss of forebrain function\" which needs further investigation. Difference between brain death and coma \n\nPeople in comas have \"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state. U.S.A. Federal and state laws \n\nSeveral laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. This recent situation involving Marlise Muñoz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives. Cost of care \n\nThe cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days). The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983. The death of Marlise Muñoz at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, TX was the most recently publicized instance of somatic support of a brain dead pregnant woman from 2013-2014. and Loewy  propose the following rubric when determining whether or not to offer life support to a pregnant, brain dead woman:\n If the fetus suffers from the event as the mother suffers, life support should not be provided. For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health has published Brain Death and Pregnancy, a report to help clinicians, healthcare administrators, and families evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding women's health. When a pregnant woman becomes brain dead, the mother can no longer acknowledge the fetus; as such, the mother no longer has a moral responsibility for keeping the fetus alive. They argue that because the brain dead patient is no longer alive, he or she ceases to be a patient; the continuation of ventilation in an effort to save the fetus can be considered a medical experiment that requires ethics committee or IRB-approval before a facility can perform this work. Public opinion and activism \n\nKeeping a medically declared 'brain dead' woman on life support to sustain a potentially viable fetus is a topic of considerable debate and controversy. There is heavy discourse between biomedical and legal experts regarding whether a dead person is \"a dysfunctional incubator\" to an unborn fetus. Supporters against life-sustaining efforts, when it conflicts with a woman's wishes, include pro-choice groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America. Supporters in favor of life-sustaining efforts include anti-abortion advocacy groups (e.g. Notable cases \n\nOn 26 August 2019 in Brno (Czech Republic) a newborn was delivered in 34th week of pregnancy to a mother declared brain-dead after a stroke. The mother was on life support since her 16th week of pregnancy. Courts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the Baby K case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. Timeline\n\nJanuary 2020 \n\nOn 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 \n\nOn 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations \n\nTurkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue \n\nOn 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Explaining that the return to normal life will happen gradually, Ministry of Health stated that Turkey has an opportunity to create and upgrade to permanently pandemic-resistant cities by subsidizing businesses to make ventilation upgrades to limit spread of viruses, tackling poor indoor air quality, which has long been a source of disease. On 7 May, the government acknowledged that the social-distancing measures, including the closure of offices and schools, ban on mass gatherings were rolled out without knowing which measures would work. Ministry of Health stated that by relaxing restrictions gradually, it will be able to make more informed recommendations on social-distancing measures in the future. On 2 June, the Turkish Parliament resumed full activities for the first time in 48 days since a hiatus was declared due to the pandemic. July 2020: Turkey opens for tourism \n\nIn July, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged a rewrite of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board guidelines to discourage reporting asymptomatic people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. On 30 August, mayors of Istanbul and Ankara Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş said that there was a mismatch between the statistics reported by Ministry of Health and the local data, and accused the national government of covering up the coronavirus resurgence. On 2 October, Minister of Internal Affairs, following an advisory opinion of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board, instructed all provinces to prohibit holding large public meetings until 1 December 2020. December 2020: Rising death roll and assessment of coronavirus vaccines \n\nOn 6 December, Ministry of Health Fahrettin Koca announced that 50 million doses of CoronaVac should arrive by the end of February 2021, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should start arriving still during December. Earlier in the spring of 2020, during the first COVID-19 surge in the Turkey, the rising death toll reached a peak on 22 April, with a seven-day average of 122 daily deaths. In December, the seven-day average of deaths in Turkey from COVID-19 broke that record, at 255 on 29 December. On 14 January 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received the COVID-19 vaccine. March 2021 \nAt the beginning of March, the Turkish government eased the restrictions, but the rates of infections rose to 21030. Turkey has witnessed a very bad season of tourism due to the restrictions of the pandemic but bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen at half-capacity in provinces with lower infection rates. On 30 March, Turkey said that it will reimpose lockdowns during weekends and restrictions during Ramadan, and that is after confirming 37,303 new cases. February 2022 \nOn February 5, 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife, Emine, have tested positive for COVID-19. Erdogan announced that they had been infected with the Omicron coronavirus and were experiencing mild symptoms. Government response\n\nChild welfare and education\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Economy \nThroughout the pandemic, despite additional headwinds such as Saudi bans on Turkish goods, Turkish economy has performed far better than that of many of the country's peers. Turkey provided a boost to the economy in a series of historically large economic packages. International aid \n\nDuring the pandemic, Turkey has provided funds, doctors, dispatched medical equipment such as PPE, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing kits, and other assistance to at least 55 countries. By setting itself up as a provider rather than a recipient of aid, Turkey portrayed itself as a valuable partner in combating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.

United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced Air Canada to heavily restrict service. The airline similarly suffered in the third quarter, reporting a loss of CA$685 million. It stated capacity in the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal year would be 75 percent lower than the previous year. Flight Centre was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a 80% decline in the company's share price (or about 85% from the August 2018 peak), cancellation of a previously announced dividend, and a suspension in trading of shares from 23 March 2020 to 7 April 2020. In early 2020, Flight Centre announced that 6,000 staff would be made redundant or placed on unpaid leave globally, due to the effects of international travel restrictions in the pandemic.

The vaccine has been cited as being among those that are easier to distribute as no ultra-cold storage is required. ; November 18 &ndash; COVID-19 pandemic: Pfizer and BioNTech complete trials on their COVID-19 vaccine, with an overall effectiveness rate of 95% \n\n develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. The risk \n\nInfluenza vaccines, also known as flu jabs or flu shots, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Vaccinating children may protect those around them. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all people over the age of six months, especially those at high risk. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups. The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with  egg allergies. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. History\n\nVaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Origins and development\nIn the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, \"Pharmacists tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and serums (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzaea name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agentand several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.\" The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as four hundred excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, demonstrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result can be cited to support lingering doubts about vaccination as well as to counter ungrounded claims about the safety of vaccination. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. Quadrivalent vaccines for seasonal flu\n\nA quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent. Medical uses\nThe U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise. Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Research demonstrates patients infected with the two viruses are over twice as likely to die as patients with only COVID-19. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely receive an influenza vaccine. An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant. In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness. In one study, conducted in a tertiary referral center, the rate of influenza vaccination in children was only 31%. Higher rates were found among immuno-suppressed pediatric patients (46%), and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (50%). Adults\n\nIn unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do. Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%. In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications. In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths. The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age. There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population. While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit. Pregnancy\nAs well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV. In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic. Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to one in ten thousand) and the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately ten times higher by 2009 estimates). Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations, a large study in China, covering close to a hundred million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 \"swine\" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects. Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given. Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms. A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine. Other\nSeveral studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine; efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger. Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Types\n\nFlu vaccines are available either as:\n a trivalent or quadrivalent intramuscular injection (IIV3, IIV4, or RIV4, that is, TIV or QIV), which contains the inactivated form of the virus\n a nasal spray of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, Q/LAIV), which contains the live but attenuated (weakened) form of the virus. TIV or QIV induce protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective) based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages. Recommendations\nVarious public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered, particularly to people at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:\n people aged 50 years of age or older\n people with chronic lung diseases, including asthma\n people with chronic heart diseases\n people with chronic liver diseases\n people with chronic kidney diseases\n people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen is not working properly\n people who are immunocompromised\n residents of nursing homes and other long-term—care facilities\n health care workers (both to prevent sickness and to prevent spread to their patients)\n \n children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection\n American Indians/Alaska Natives\n people who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults)\n\nThe flu vaccine is contraindicated for those under six months of age and those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. Particularly:\n People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, including the morbidly obese, healthy pregnant women, children 6–59 months, the elderly, aboriginals, and people suffering from one of an itemized list of chronic health conditions\n People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk, including household contacts and health care workers\n People who provide essential community services\n Certain poultry workers\n\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was not available in Canada for the 2019–2020 season. European Union\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends vaccinating the elderly as a priority, with a secondary priority people with chronic medical conditions and health care workers. The influenza vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than limiting influenza circulation or totally eliminating human influenza sickness. This is in contrast with the high herd immunity strategies for other infectious diseases such as polio and measles. United States\n\nIn the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged six months and over. According to the CDC, the live attenuated virus (LAIV4) (which comes in the form of the nasal spray in the US) should be avoided by some groups. The US government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States. She urged eligible people to get COVID-19 and flu vaccines. She maintains flu vaccination is important every year. People need to know that flu can be fatal as many people do not know this. Australia uses inactivated vaccines. Uptake\n\nAt risk groups\nUptake of flu vaccination, both seasonally and during pandemics, is often low. Beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are also important. Health care workers\nFrontline health care workers are often recommended to get seasonal and any pandemic flu vaccination. The main reason to vaccinate health care workers is to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence at a time of high service demand, but the reasons health care workers state for their decisions to accept or decline vaccination may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza. Manufacturing\n\nResearch continues into the idea of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine that would not require tailoring to a particular strain, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs are inoculated separately. , both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are eleven or twelve days old. At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers. Done on a large-scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population. A gene-based DNA vaccine, used to prime the immune system after boosting with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, underwent clinical trials in 2011. The applicant for this medicinal product is Sanofi Pasteur. Because of the way it is produced, it produces better-matched vaccine (to the flu strains). Cost-effectiveness\nThe cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (over 65), the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination. In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden, as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine. In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings. Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences that will help researchers' understanding of what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current vaccine methods are being researched. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Microsoft's Bing search engine, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the influenza-like illness reduction percentage in areas where vaccinations have been performed. The method has been used to quantify the impact of two flu vaccination programmes in England (2013/14 and 2014/15), where school-age children were administered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Notably, the impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England based on traditional syndromic surveillance endpoints. , more than seventy known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the FDA approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month. Audenz is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Audenz is approved for use in persons six months of age and older at increased risk of exposure to the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades. Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have experimented with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than one microgram. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination. A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Most swine flu vaccines include an H1N1 and an H3N2 strain. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated, are made and used in the more difficult cases. The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. However, a vaccine was found in 2004. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. A February 2018 CDC interim report estimated the vaccine effectiveness to be 25% against H3N2, 67% against H1N1, and 42% against influenza B. United States\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the quadrivalent formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines for the US 2020–2021 influenza season contain the following:\n\n an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/HongKong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria lineage);\n a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage).

Cell-based trivalent vaccines should contain:\n an A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.

A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. Quadrivalent vaccines for seasonal flu\n\nA quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent. Medical uses\nThe U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise. Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Research demonstrates patients infected with the two viruses are over twice as likely to die as patients with only COVID-19. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely receive an influenza vaccine. An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant. In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness. In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of influenza vaccination in healthy 5–18-year-olds, and in 2015, published a review of the use of pediatric Fluad in children 6–72 months of age. In one study, conducted in a tertiary referral center, the rate of influenza vaccination in children was only 31%. Higher rates were found among immuno-suppressed pediatric patients (46%), and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (50%). Adults\n\nIn unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do. Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%. In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications. In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths. The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age. There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population. While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit. Pregnancy\nAs well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV. In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic. Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to one in ten thousand) and the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately ten times higher by 2009 estimates). Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations, a large study in China, covering close to a hundred million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 \"swine\" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects. Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given. Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms. A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine. Other\nSeveral studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine; efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger. Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Types\n\nFlu vaccines are available either as:\n a trivalent or quadrivalent intramuscular injection (IIV3, IIV4, or RIV4, that is, TIV or QIV), which contains the inactivated form of the virus\n a nasal spray of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, Q/LAIV), which contains the live but attenuated (weakened) form of the virus. TIV or QIV induce protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective) based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages. Recommendations\nVarious public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered, particularly to people at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:\n people aged 50 years of age or older\n people with chronic lung diseases, including asthma\n people with chronic heart diseases\n people with chronic liver diseases\n people with chronic kidney diseases\n people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen is not working properly\n people who are immunocompromised\n residents of nursing homes and other long-term—care facilities\n health care workers (both to prevent sickness and to prevent spread to their patients)\n \n children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection\n American Indians/Alaska Natives\n people who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults)\n\nThe flu vaccine is contraindicated for those under six months of age and those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. Particularly:\n People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, including the morbidly obese, healthy pregnant women, children 6–59 months, the elderly, aboriginals, and people suffering from one of an itemized list of chronic health conditions\n People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk, including household contacts and health care workers\n People who provide essential community services\n Certain poultry workers\n\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was not available in Canada for the 2019–2020 season. European Union\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends vaccinating the elderly as a priority, with a secondary priority people with chronic medical conditions and health care workers. The influenza vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than limiting influenza circulation or totally eliminating human influenza sickness. This is in contrast with the high herd immunity strategies for other infectious diseases such as polio and measles. United States\n\nIn the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged six months and over. According to the CDC, the live attenuated virus (LAIV4) (which comes in the form of the nasal spray in the US) should be avoided by some groups. The US government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States. She urged eligible people to get COVID-19 and flu vaccines. She maintains flu vaccination is important every year. People need to know that flu can be fatal as many people do not know this. Australia uses inactivated vaccines. Uptake\n\nAt risk groups\nUptake of flu vaccination, both seasonally and during pandemics, is often low. Beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are also important. Health care workers\nFrontline health care workers are often recommended to get seasonal and any pandemic flu vaccination. The main reason to vaccinate health care workers is to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence at a time of high service demand, but the reasons health care workers state for their decisions to accept or decline vaccination may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza. Manufacturing\n\nResearch continues into the idea of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine that would not require tailoring to a particular strain, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs are inoculated separately. , both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are eleven or twelve days old. At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers. Done on a large-scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population. A gene-based DNA vaccine, used to prime the immune system after boosting with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, underwent clinical trials in 2011. The applicant for this medicinal product is Sanofi Pasteur. Because of the way it is produced, it produces better-matched vaccine (to the flu strains). Cost-effectiveness\nThe cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (over 65), the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination. In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden, as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine. In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings. Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences that will help researchers' understanding of what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current vaccine methods are being researched. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Microsoft's Bing search engine, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the influenza-like illness reduction percentage in areas where vaccinations have been performed. The method has been used to quantify the impact of two flu vaccination programmes in England (2013/14 and 2014/15), where school-age children were administered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Notably, the impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England based on traditional syndromic surveillance endpoints. , more than seventy known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the FDA approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month. Audenz is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Audenz is approved for use in persons six months of age and older at increased risk of exposure to the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades. Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have experimented with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than one microgram. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination. A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Most swine flu vaccines include an H1N1 and an H3N2 strain. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated, are made and used in the more difficult cases. The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. However, a vaccine was found in 2004. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. A February 2018 CDC interim report estimated the vaccine effectiveness to be 25% against H3N2, 67% against H1N1, and 42% against influenza B. United States\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the quadrivalent formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines for the US 2020–2021 influenza season contain the following:\n\n an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/HongKong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria lineage);\n a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage). Cell-based trivalent vaccines should contain:\n an A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. Cell-based trivalent vaccines should contain:\n an A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.

This is revealed in a study by scientists from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the University of Glasgow, and the Ivorian National Animal Health Institute. In 2004, Leendertz' team at RKI discovered a previously unknown type of the anthrax bacterium in dead chimpanzees in the rainforests of Taï National Park: Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis. Studies conducted since have shown that the same type has also caused mortality in isolated cases in chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. \"To our surprise, almost 40 percent of all animal deaths in Taï National Park we investigated were attributable to anthrax,\" reports Emmanuel Couacy-Hymann from the Ivorian Animal Health Institute. The researchers found the pathogen in several monkey species, duikers, mongoose, and a porcupine. Most seriously affected were the chimpanzees: 31 of the 55 individuals whose carcasses were examined had died from the disease. In addition, the researchers are searching for ways to protect the chimpanzees, including the possibility of vaccination. In the African forest, Fabian Leendertz and his team look for new infectious agents that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Could one of them cause the next pandemic? Two established examples are rabies and bubonic plague, both of which can be deadly for humans. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) originated in chimpanzees or gorillas, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by an avian coronavirus, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic came from – well, you can guess. Ebola virus, for example, was passed from apes to humans, presumably by the consumption of ‘bush meat’: wild animals such as fruit bats or monkeys that are hunted for food. Any virus or bacterium that infects our primate relatives could also be dangerous to us. To identify new infectious agents that jump the species barrier, therefore, the German researchers teamed up with behavioural scientists in Ivory Coast, West Africa, to study the great apes. They collaborate as part of the Great Ape Health Monitoring Unitw2, an institute that provides space to researchers from around the world who want to obtain samples from wild apes. Whenever one of the apes that they are studying becomes ill or dies, the team collects blood, faeces and urine samples to send to Fabian and his group in Berlin. If the ape dies, it is autopsied on-site by one of the veterinarians. Does the newly discovered microbe infect only apes or can it be transmitted to humans? Could they pass the disease on to other humans? If the pathogen proves to be dangerous, the health authorities are notified and take charge of emergency measures. Sick people are quarantined, doctors and nurses are called to the outbreak zone, and bush markets and public transport may be shut down temporarily. “We carry a mobile miniature lab with which we can instantly test for the most dangerous species, like Ebola virus,” explains Fabian. The research strategy has proved successful: in recent years, the group discovered why wild chimpanzees had started dying of anthrax (Leendertz et al., 2004). The bacterial strain that evolved from this genetic transfer (Bacillus cereus anthracis) can live in the soil and is highly virulent, thus posing a lethal threat to chimpanzees. Why are zootonic infectious so dangerous? How may environmental changes cause more zootonic infections in the near future? What could governments do to prevent new pandemics? What tests allow scientists to determine if an individual has been infected by a zoonosis? How should authorities manage an emergency of a pandemic caused by zoonosis? This article could also be used to stimulate discussions about the history of infectious diseases; the interactions of organisms with their environment; and recent food security scandals. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID-19 virus. Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. African green monkeys (also called vervets, genus Chlorocebus) in African populations are heavily infected with SIVagm, while the virus is absent in the founder isolate \n\n In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed. In 2001, scientists noticed that antibodies peculiar to humans were found in macaque monkeys, both wild and domesticated. Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are \"a common phenomena in Asia\". In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

To help reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in nursing homes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Long-term Care: HAIs/CAUTI aimed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), enhance frontline healthcare professional knowledge about infection prevention, and improve the safety culture in nursing homes. For example, only 64% of VA nursing homes had policies specifying the appropriate indications for catheter use compared with 81% of non-VA nursing homes. Mody L, Greene M, Saint S, et al., and Krein S. Comparing Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection Prevention Programs between VA and Non-VA Nursing Homes. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. Of particular note is the distinction between symptomatic UTI vs. asymptomatic UTI (or, ASB). Given the important clinical and economic consequences of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), researchers across the world have attempted various methods to prevent this common, costly, and morbid patient safety problem. In this section, we summarize the evidence supporting the use of several practices to prevent CAUTI. Fortunately, members of our Ann Arbor VA Medical Center/University of Michigan Patient Safety Research group have been involved in the development of most of these guidelines. Do not use the indwelling catheter unless you must! Urinary tract infection represents almost 40% of all healthcare-associated infections, with the vast majority due to the indwelling urinary catheter. Urinary catheter-related infection leads to substantial morbidity. The incidence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients is about 5% per day. The presentation of catheter-associated infection varies from asymptomatic bacteriuria to overwhelming sepsis and even death. Patients with bloodstream infection may present with fever, confusion, and hypotension. A key first step leading to CAUTI is the colonization of the catheter with organisms. Many of the infectious complications of the urinary catheter could be prevented by using the catheter only when necessary and promptly removing it when no longer needed. While these devices provide important benefits in some patients, they are also the primary risk factor for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Indwelling urinary catheters, however, also lead to significant non-infectious complications. Urinary catheters cause patient discomfort. In one prospective study, for example, 42% of catheterized patients report the indwelling catheter was uncomfortable, 48% complained that it was painful, and 61% noted that it restricted their activities of daily living. Thus, for some patients urinary catheters operate as a physical restraint, tantamount to binding them to the bed, substantially and unnecessarily limiting their ability to function freely and with dignity. Restricted activity not only reduces patient autonomy, it also promotes other patient safety problems, such as venous thromboembolism, deconditioning, and pressure ulcers. In short, there are compelling reasons to limit indwelling urinary catheterization because of both non-infectious and infectious complications. The Ann Arbor Criteria are an updated set of recommendations that define when use of an indwelling urinary catheter is appropriate for hospitalized medical patients. Aseptic technique is strongly recommended during the insertion of indwelling urinary catheters, based on biologic principles, the pathogenesis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms. A recent analysis of patient safety practices by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality emphasized the important role of nurses in preventing CAUTI, the most common healthcare-associated infection. While physicians and medical students occasionally insert indwelling urinary catheters, nurses are generally responsible for the insertion and maintenance of urinary catheters; unlicensed personnel may also insert indwelling catheters under the direction of registered nurses. As part of their nursing education, student nurses are taught catheter insertion practices through simulation and clinical experiences. Anecdotal evidence – coupled with preliminary observations done by the University of Michigan CAUTI research group – reveal that proper aseptic technique is not reliably used when indwelling urinary catheters are inserted. The risk of infection increases by 5% for each day that a catheter remains in place, and the length of time that a catheter remains in place is the most important risk factor for the development of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Up to half of patients with an indwelling catheter for 5 days or longer will have bacteria or fungus in their urine. Therefore, once an indwelling urinary catheter is inserted, ongoing vigilance (abstract) is needed to reduce the risks of both infectious and non-infectious complications. Many times physicians are not aware that patients’ urinary catheters are still in place, so we begin this section with assessment strategies to maintain awareness of catheter presence and determine the ongoing need for an indwelling catheter. In this section we also provide evidence-based guidance for catheter care and securement, drainage, transportation with a catheter, and talking points for patients and families related to indwelling urinary catheters. While it is better for the patient not to have an indwelling urinary catheter at all, when catheters are necessary our recommendations in this section will help minimize risks associated with catheter use. Thus, many hours and days can pass before a urinary catheter that is no longer necessary is recognized and removed; by default, urinary catheters usually remain in place until these steps occur. In contrast, using strategies to remind and prompt removal of unnecessary urinary catheters has the potential to bypass several of these steps, and reduce the occurrence of hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections. “Reminders” function simply to remind the clinicians (physician and/or nurse) that a urinary catheter is still being used, and may provide an educational list of reasons to continue or discontinue the urinary catheter. “Stop orders” prompt the clinician to remove the catheter by default after a certain time period or a set of clinical conditions has occurred (such as 24 or 48 hours post-operative) unless the catheter remains clinically appropriate. Stop orders “expire” in the same fashion as restraint or antibiotic orders, unless action is taken by physicians. Stop orders directed at nurses will empower nurses to remove the catheter on the basis of a list of indications, without requiring the nurse to obtain a physician-signed order before removing the catheter (bypassing steps 1-4). Using electronic catheter orders can increase catheter use inadvertently by making indwelling catheters easier to order than alternatives. Physicians and/or nurses should document the rationale for leaving the catheter in if appropriate indications are not met. Nurses may not be comfortable initially with the responsibility of removing urinary catheters without a physician order. Incontinence is a very tempting reason for placing a urinary catheter. Encourage bedside staff to avoid placing catheters for incontinence by providing other readily available strategies to manage incontinent patients, including bedside commodes, incontinence garments, condom catheters for male patients, and “people power” to provide prompted toileting and bed linen changes. Several clinical and economic studies have evaluated antimicrobial urinary catheters, including individual trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Economic evaluations are important to consider given the additional cost of antimicrobial catheter trays (approximately $5). Different antimicrobial urinary catheters have been evaluated in patients over the past few decades, including silver (either alloy or oxide) and nitrofurazone-releasing catheters. This randomized trial compared three different catheters – silver alloy, nitrofurazone-releasing, and a control (polytetrafluoroethylene–coated latex catheter) – and found no significant difference in rates of symptomatic CAUTI between the silver alloy and control catheters. There was a small decrease in rates of symptomatic CAUTI with the use of nitrofurazone-releasing catheters compared with control, however, this decrease was not deemed to be clinically important. The makers of the nitrofurazone-releasing catheter announced (PDF) in 2012 that they will discontinue manufacturing and marketing the device. An accompanying editorial provides a useful perspective on the limitations of this study as well as the role of antimicrobial catheters in patients at high-risk of CAUTI (e.g., neutropenic and severely immune-compromised patients). ​Currently, antimicrobial catheters are not recommended for routine use in hospitalized patients. Indwelling urinary catheters lead to both infectious and non-infectious complications. Despite these potential harms, studies have found that initial catheterization was inappropriate 21% to 50% of the time, and that continued catheter use was inappropriate almost half of the days that patients are catheterized. A common reason for inappropriate continued catheter use is that physicians forget, or are never aware of, the presence of the catheter. In one multi-center evaluation, inpatient physicians at 4 hospitals were asked whether or not each patient on their service had a urinary catheter in place. Incorrect negative responses were recorded for over one-third of attending physicians and more than a quarter of resident physicians. For inappropriately catheterized patients, the proportion of physicians unaware of the presence of a catheter was even higher (over 50% for attending physicians and over 40% of senior residents). Physicians should assess daily whether or not their catheterized patient still requires the catheter. While nursing involvement in catheter insertion, care, and removal is paramount, physicians also play an important role in prevention efforts. The physician champion – often an infectious diseases specialist, hospital epidemiologist, urologist, or hospitalist – can inform physicians about the planned prevention program, encourage support for the program, be available to answer questions, and help educate other physicians about the appropriate indications for catheter use. Below, we provide specific strategies for engaging physicians in CAUTI prevention. However nurse engagement is defined, it refers to buy-in, and in our case buy-in by nurses for the catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention program. The question answered in this section is: how can nurses break their bond with the catheter? Below, we provide specific strategies for engaging nurses in CAUTI prevention. This section describes several common barriers encountered by other hospitals when instituting changes related to the insertion and care of indwelling urinary catheters as well as the strategies they used to overcome those barriers (PDF). Importantly, some of the most important leaders in infection prevention activities are not senior executives. In brief, since October 2008, hospitals are no longer eligible for additional payment from CMS to treat several common and/or high morbidity hospital-acquired complications, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections and pressure ulcers. ​We began our work over 10 years ago, and through our research we have identified key elements for developing a comprehensive program to reduce indwelling urinary catheter use and reduce CAUTI. A general overview for developing a program to reduce CAUTI can be found via the button below. A key aspect of implementing a ‘catheter out’/CAUTI prevention program is to identify an implementation team at your site. This toolkit provides materials and information to reduce indwelling urinary catheter use and CAUTI among hospitalized adult patients. Use the materials in this toolkit as a template, but be creative and construct a program that will be successful and lead to a sustainable reduction in catheter use at your institution. For example, measuring indwelling urinary catheter use rates can provide important information for identifying the units in which to begin your program, while continued assessments can be used to encourage staff and to help maintain observed improvements. ​Collecting data is critically important for understanding whether or not your facility has an unacceptably high number of patients with indwelling urinary catheters without an appropriate indication. Collecting and comparing data both before and after an intervention will provide a relatively objective way to evaluate if your interventions are successful in reducing unnecessary catheter-days and subsequent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Once indwelling catheter use and catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates have substantially decreased, you’ll want to know how to keep these rates low. ​And speaking of education, why not disseminate how well your organization has managed to reduce and possibly eliminate the most common of all healthcare-associated infections? Reducing CAUTI can become a source of organizational pride and possibly lead to a reduction in other infections as well. In the Detailed Protocols section are two detailed protocols, one designed to reduce CAUTI in the emergency department, and another designed for nurses to lead and to reduce CAUTI in non-intensive care units. Fliers and pocket cards can be useful tools to frequently remind care givers about appropriate indications and early removal of indwelling urinary catheters. These tools can be used to publicize and disseminate your local indwelling urinary catheter removal message to physicians, nurses, aides and other staff involved in the insertion and care of indwelling urinary catheters! The one page sheet entitled, “FAQs about Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections,” (PDF) provides patients with a good overview of urinary catheters as well as catheter-associated urinary tract infections and how patients can safely care for their urinary catheter. urinary tract infections from catheters, pressure ulcer, and sepsis from catheters. These problems affect nurses both personally and professionally, and it may affect their patients as well. It then compared a hospital’s percentage of burnout nurses to its rates of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs). Dr. Wagner reminds nurses that there are simple steps they can take to help reduce the incidence of HAIs. Other preventive measures bring a nurse’s role as patient advocate into play. Dr. Wagner encourages nurses to check online resources that recommend nursing interventions for preventing common types of HAIs. The CDC’s latest recommendations are compiled in the 2009 Guideline for Prevention of CAUTIs and in the Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place. Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters. Self catheterization requires doing the procedure periodically during the day, the frequency depending on fluid intake\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Firstly, the familiarity of the barbershop setting within the participants' community can help foster a sense of comfort and trust. In the study mentioned, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide counseling on hypertension. As trusted advisors within the community, barbers played a crucial role in engaging participants and facilitating discussions on healthcare. This approach allowed for easy access to blood pressure screenings and immediate referrals to healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists who were available in the barbershop. The convenience of having healthcare services provided within the barbershop itself eliminates the need for participants to travel to another location for assistance. Moreover, the study highlighted that the interventions in the barbershop setting were associated with increased patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Participants in the intervention group, who received screenings and pharmacist consultations in the barbershop, were more receptive to lifestyle modification recommendations. Overall, conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop setting offers advantages such as enhanced patient engagement, improved accessibility, and increased compliance. The purpose of the $8.5 million grant awarded to the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute physician is to support a new, randomized, controlled clinical trial aimed at enlisting African-American barbers in the fight against hypertension. The physician, Ronald G. Victor, MD, conducted a previous study that showed offering blood pressure checks during men's haircuts and encouraging patrons with hypertension to follow up with physicians could save hundreds of lives annually. Now, with the grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Dr. Victor will conduct a new trial with 500 African-American male patrons of 20 Los Angeles-area barbershops. The goal of this trial is to test the effectiveness of barbershop hypertension programs and evaluate whether expanding such programs is feasible and cost-effective. In fact, our current healthcare system and reimbursement protocols frame it as such. However, a recent study on high blood pressure took place in a barbershop, and researchers wanted to learn more about patient compliance to medical recommendations and medications. Why Study High Blood Pressure in a Barbershop? Researchers chose to conduct a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop because it was a familiar setting within the participants’ community. They also trained barbers, who were considered as trusted advisors, to measure blood pressure and council participants on hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were screened for high blood pressure by their barber and then referred to meet with a pharmacist who was in the barbershop. The pharmacist provided medication and education for lifestyle modifications. The control group received education from their barber on lifestyle modifications. Researchers concluded that the location of this study and its convenience impacted patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, the intervention group did not have to go to another location to receive help from the pharmacists, as they were immediately available in the barbershop. While not a physician, the barber was viewed by all participants as a reliable member of the community. Therefore, the experiment suggests that patients must trust the individual delivering healthcare recommendations. The barbershop study demonstrates that to improve care on a larger scale, fewer restrictions should be placed on the type of qualified provider and setting of treatment. PreviousWhat Is Phlebotomy And Why Is It Convenient to Have In Your Primary Care Doctor’s Office? Los Angeles, CA (BlackNews.com) — Visiting a barbershop in California this Saturday could mean more than getting a haircut. It might be a lifesaver. The Black Barbershop Health Outreach Program, a unique, grassroots approach to health screening and education, will be held at more than 80 barbershops in 23 cities statewide on Saturday, May 22 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. In hundreds of nearby barbershops, African American men nationwide will receive free screening for diabetes and hypertension, and learn why early detection of prostate cancer can be a life-saving decision. Led by Dr. Bill J. Releford, D.P.M., founder of The Diabetic Amputation Prevention (DAP) Foundation, along with a squadron of volunteers, the outreach program seeks to empower African American men to better understand cardiovascular diseases through education, testing and prevention. Through black-owned barbershops, which represent a cultural institution of familiarity and trust, the outreach program has adopted a novel means to spread health information. Data collected from the California barbershops will be analyzed and processed at Charles Drew University. Since 2007, nearly 400 black-owned barbershops have participated in the program. To learn more about the health outreach effort, and to view a complete list of those barbershops involved, please go to www.BlackBarbershop.org. For more information on participating in the program, or learning about sponsorship opportunities, please visit www.BlackBarbershop.org.

In a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, the team found that teenage boys who have a combination of depressive symptoms and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression than those who show neither trait. The findings suggest teenagers could in future be screened for such signals, and those at highest risk could be helped to develop the kind of coping strategies and \"brain fitness\" to help them avoid becoming depressive. \"(And) we now have a very real way of identifying those teenage boys most likely to develop clinical depression.\" For their study, Goodyear's team measured levels of cortisol in saliva from two large separate groups of teenagers. The first group of 660 provided samples on four school mornings within a week and then again 12 months later. A second group of 1198 teenagers gave samples over three school mornings. Use these social-bookmarking links to share Biomarker could help boys at risk of major depression. “Low levels of the stress hormone cortisol marks out children at higher risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome as adults,” reported the BBC today. It said that if children with low levels of cortisol are exposed to trauma such as sexual abuse, they are six times more likely to develop the condition when older. Contrary to the impression that might be gained from parts of the news report, this study did not assess cortisol levels in childhood, but only in adults with or without CFS. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Archives of General Psychiatry . The researchers wanted to investigate this by looking at levels of the hormone cortisol in people with and without CFS. Cortisol is involved in the body’s stress response. Of these people, 124 were confirmed as healthy, and acted as controls. All participants had a psychiatric examination, and the researchers excluded anyone who had certain conditions, such as manic depression (bipolar disorder) or psychosis. The participants’ cortisol levels were measured using samples of their saliva taken immediately upon waking in the morning, and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later. The researchers then compared levels of childhood trauma between the cases and controls. The researchers also looked at the relationship between cortisol levels, childhood trauma and CFS. If the participants were split into those with and without trauma, only those with CFS and childhood trauma had reduced cortisol levels. The researchers conclude that their results “confirm childhood trauma as an important risk factor of CFS”. This may indicate the biological mechanism behind how childhood trauma could affect risk of CFS. They say that their findings “are critical to inform pathophysiological research and to devise targets for the prevention of CFS”. This study only measured cortisol levels in adults who were already known to have or not have CFS. Therefore it cannot indicate whether cortisol levels in childhood owuld be able to predict risk of CFS in later life. Although this study cannot prove that childhood trauma itself “causes” CFS, or that childhood cortisol levels can predict CFS in adulthood, this study contributes to knowledge about potential risk factors for CFS. Much more research is needed to fully understand the causes of this complex condition. These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis. Foster children have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in comparison to children raised by their biological parents. Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system. Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences. But during the pruning process of adolescence, if a child is subject to high stress\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. On 1 April, two United States officials said that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community. Mao Qun'an, spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said on Wednesday that China faces a \"substantially increased risk\" of more imported cases. Mao made his remarks at a news conference as the condition of China's first confirmed MERS patient, who is from South Korea, was reported to be in stable condition at a hospital in Guangdong province. Inspections of disease control and treatment work will be performed at high risk regions like south Guangdong province and the capital of Beijing,\" he said. MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, similar to SARS. Also on Wednesday, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered border quarantine staff to refer suspected cases to designated hospitals for further investigation. Chinese who are heading to affected areas should avoid visiting local hospitals and having contact with bats and single-hump camels.

We spoke with Sattva Neelapu, M.D., to learn more. Doctors extract T cells (a type of white blood cell) from the patient’s blood and then add an artificial receptor (called a “chimeric antigen receptor”) to their surface. CAR T-cell therapy can cause some unusual side effects. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. It’s also known as a “cytokine storm.” About 70-90% of patients experience it, but it’s very short-term and only lasts about five to seven days. It usually starts around the second or third day after the infusion. There’s a very effective remedy for CRS now called tocilizumab, which reverses this side effect fairly quickly. The medicine was originally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but has since been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CRS. The other side effect is known as “CRES,” which stands for “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome.” It typically starts around day five after the infusion. Patients eventually recover all of their neurological functions. Which types of cancer can CAR T-cell therapy treat currently? We have different FDA-approved cell therapy products for each of these cancers, thanks to clinical trials. Indolent B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. The reason it fails in some patients is that the tumor cells mutate quickly and shed the target molecule, so the CAR T-cells can’t “see” the cancer anymore. But first, we have to show that it’s at least as effective — or more effective — than those therapies. What are some advantages of CAR T-cell therapy? CAR T-cell therapy is also a living drug, and its benefits can last for many years. Since the cells can persist in the body long-term, they will still recognize and attack cancer cells if and when there’s a relapse. These are patients whose cancers were deemed very aggressive and for whom other standards of care had failed. What type of patient is a good candidate for CAR T-cell therapy? Until late 2017, there was no standard of care for someone who had already been through two lines of treatment and not achieved remission. How easy is it for patients to obtain CAR T-cell therapy? If they’ve already been through two lines of unsuccessful treatment, they can get the FDA-approved commercial product. So, patients should ask their doctors early on about clinical trial options when they are considering treatment for their cancer. What’s the one thing you want patients to know about CAR T-cell therapy? And it’s offering hope to people who’d previously been given only about six months to live. As researchers have learned more about what makes cancer cells different from normal cells, they have developed mAbs to exploit these differences. Newer forms of mAbs are less likely to cause immune reactions. One part attaches to a cancer cell, while the other attaches to an immune cell, bringing the two together and leading to an immune response. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. Cancer cells sometimes take advantage of these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. Researchers have also found promising early results against a number of other cancer types. Only a handful of these treatments have been approved for use so far, but many others are now being studied in clinical trials. In melanoma, this combined approach has been shown to work better than using either treatment alone, but the combination also comes with an increased risk of serious side effects. As researchers have learned over the years, the immune system is very complex. It has also become clear that cancer cells have different ways of eluding the immune system, which makes creating effective vaccines difficult. The cells are altered (and killed) in the lab to make them more likely to be attacked by the immune system and then injected back into the patient. Most tumor cell vaccines are autologous, meaning the vaccine is made from killed tumor cells taken from the same person in whom they will later be used. The antigens are usually proteins or pieces of proteins called peptides. They break down cancer cells into smaller pieces (including antigens), and then hold out these antigens so other immune cells called T cells can see them. Doctors remove some immune cells from the patient’s blood and expose them in the lab to cancer cells or cancer antigens, as well as to other chemicals that turn the immune cells into dendritic cells and help them grow. The dendritic cells are then injected back into the patient, where they should cause an immune response to cancer cells in the body. Finally, these vaccines might be easier and less expensive to make than some other vaccines. This is not a complete list – vaccines are being studied in other types of cancer as well. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. These are known as oncolytic viruses. An example is talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), which is an oncolytic virus that has been modified to make GM-CSF, a protein that boosts the immune response. This virus can be used to treat melanomas in the skin or lymph nodes that can’t be removed with surgery. It is injected directly into the tumors, typically every 2 weeks. This treatment can sometimes shrink these tumors, but it has not been shown to shrink tumors in other parts of the body. These types of treatments show a lot of promise, but they are complex and so far are available only through clinical trials being done at major medical centers. These receptors will attach to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. These approvals are based on the results of clinical trials showing that in many patients the cancer could no longer be found after treatment. It is not yet clear if these treatments will result in a long-term cure. Researchers are also still learning about long-term side effects of these treatments. Doctors are still improving how they make the T cells and are learning the best ways to use them for different types of cancer. When injected back into the patient, these cells can be active cancer fighters. Treatments using TILs are being tested in clinical trials in people with melanoma, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, and other cancers. Early studies of this approach by researchers from the National Cancer Institute have been promising, but its use may be limited because doctors might not be able to get TILs from all patients. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a personalized cellular therapy treatment for leukemia developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The first-of-its-kind therapy treats cancer by altering a patient's own cells to fight cancer. If you have questions or think you might be a candidate, please discuss with your physician. Over the past several years, cancer researchers have discovered the impact that the immune system can have on treating and preventing cancer. In particular, researchers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center have identified the effect of T cells, which are responsible for the identification and destruction of abnormal substances, like cancer. This treatment allows for the body’s immune system to be super charged with large quantities of CAR T cells which will seek out and attack cancer cells. Who can benefit from this new treatment? If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with ALL, speak with the treating oncologist about all options for treatment. Will this work for my type of cancer? For additional information on current clinical trials available at the Abramson Cancer Center please click here. This treatment has been approved by the FDA and may be covered or reimbursed by your insurance. What are questions I should ask my or my child’s oncologist? How is the treatment given and what is the procedure like? How many treatments are needed and how long will they take to be given? What are the chances of remission or cure? Which Cancer Therapies Use T-Cells? Here, in the context of cancer treatment, we are mainly concerned with that second type, the T-cell. In brief, it’s a cutting-edge therapy that genetically programs your own T-cells to be better at recognizing and attacking cancer within. Tinkering with your body’s immune system to try to fight cancer is not entirely new. Designed to act as a bridge between a cancer cell and a T-cell to promote cancer cell death. One of them, sipuleucel-T, sounds very much like a CAR T-cell therapy in that it uses your immune cells which are first collected from the bloodstream individually and then processed in the laboratory; they are activated and made to be more responsive to the tumor cells, then infused back into the bloodstream as the therapy. Ipilimumab is just one example of a medicine that works in this way. CAR-T cell therapies, however, are clearly their own distinct entity. T-cells are taken out of your body, genetically programmed to better recognize and kill tumor cells, and then re-introduced as the living therapy. These newer treatments generally arise out of the unfortunate fact that, for patients with late-stage disease, traditional cancer treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, oftentimes offer limited efficacy. So far, two CAR-T cell therapies have been FDA approved. These patients typically have a poor prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in nearly a dozen countries, 82 percent of patients went into remission. Besides relapsed or refractory pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). They receive infusions of immune globulins every few months as a protective measure. One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flu-like symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis isn’t planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. There are 30 to 35 medical centers designated to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training. This underscores the urgent medical need for these patients. Again, these drugs should be used with caution and only in only designated medical centers. There have also been failures, however, and quite a bit of troubleshooting to make these therapies as effective as possible with the least amount of toxicity. Immunotherapy. 2014;6(12):1265-1278. Bhoj VG, Arhontoulis D, Wertheim G, et al. 2016;128(3):360-370. 2016;127(26):3305-3311. 2016;127(26):3312-3320. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans. The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example. The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission. Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure. It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use. One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others. Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead. The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy. After she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. She was dramatically better within hours. Tests showed her cancer was gone. For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died. But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, masking, improving ventilation and air filtration, and quarantining those who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments include monoclonal antibodies, novel antiviral drugs, and symptom control. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. Etymology \nThe pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the \"coronavirus pandemic\", despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma. WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020. Epidemiology\n\nBackground \n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there, but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier. The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal. Despite this, the subject has generated extensive speculation about alternative origins. The origin controversy heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China. The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1December 2019. That individual did not have a connection with the later wet market cluster. Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected between mid-October and mid-November 2019. Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. Multiple studies claimed that total infections are considerably greater than reported cases. On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies. Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested. A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected. In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors including new COVID-19 variants. Deaths \n\nAs of , more than  deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020. These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health. Conversely, deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included. Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases, including those without a test, thereby increasing counts. Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 9.5 to 18.6 million by The Economist, as well as over 10.3 million by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Such deaths include deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities, as well as reluctance to seek care (to avoid possible infection). Mortality rates increase as a function of age. Other studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'. In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for various countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%. For comparison the IFR for middle-aged adults is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. This study reported that most of the differences reflected corresponding differences in the population's age structure and the age-specific pattern of infections. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Transmission \n\nThe disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles (that form an aerosol) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close. Cause \n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species. Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Diagnosis \n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Vaccines \n\nA COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID‑19. The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. As of late-December 2021, more than 4.49 billion people had received one or more doses (8+ billion in total) in over 197 countries. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was the most widely used. Treatment \n\nFor the first two years of the pandemic no specific, effective treatment or cure was available. The antiviral remdesivir is available in the US, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for use with mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to limited evidence of its efficacy. Variants \n\nSeveral variants have been named by WHO and labelled as a variant of concern (VoC) or a variant of interest (VoI). They share the more infectious D614G mutation: Delta dominated and then eliminated earlier VoC from most jurisdictions. Omicron's immune escape ability may allow it to spread via breakthrough infections, which in turn may allow it to coexist with Delta, which more often infects the unvaccinated. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Strategies \n\nMany countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 by recommending, mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes, while others relied primarily on providing information. Experts differentiate between elimination strategies (commonly known as \"zero-COVID\")  that aim to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community,  and mitigation strategies (commonly known as \"flattening the curve\") that attempt to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerate some level of transmission within the community. These initial strategies can be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Nature reported in 2021 that 90% of immunologists who responded to a survey \"think that the coronavirus will become endemic\". Containment \n\nContainment is undertaken to stop an outbreak from spreading into the general population. Infected individuals are isolated while they are infectious. The people they have interacted with are contacted and isolated for long enough to ensure that they are either not infected or no longer contagious. Screening is the starting point for containment. The Zero-COVID strategy involves using public health measures such as contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns and mitigation software in order to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon as it is detected, with the goal of getting the area back to zero detected infections and resuming normal economic and social activities. Successful containment or suppression reduces Rt to less than 1. Mitigation \n\nShould containment fail, efforts focus on mitigation: measures taken to slow the spread and limit its effects on the healthcare system and society. Successful mitigation delays and decreases the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the epidemic curve\". This decreases the risk of overwhelming health services and provides more time for developing vaccines and treatments. Non-pharmaceutical interventions \n\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions that may reduce spread include personal actions such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at reducing interpersonal contacts such as closing workplaces and schools and cancelling large gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Other measures \nMore drastic actions, such as quarantining entire populations and strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. The pandemic drove widespread adoption of telehealth. Improvised manufacturing \nDue to capacity supply chains limitations, some manufacturers began 3D printing material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts. On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is undergoing further testing. Millions of face shields, protective gowns, and masks were made. Other ad hoc medical supplies included shoe covers, surgical caps, powered air-purifying respirators, and hand sanitizer. Herd immunity \nIn July 2021, several experts expressed concern that achieving herd immunity may not be possible because Delta can transmit among vaccinated individuals. CDC published data showing that vaccinated people could transmit Delta, something officials believed was less likely with other variants. Consequently, WHO and CDC encouraged vaccinated people to continue with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking, social distancing, and quarantining if exposed. It is possible that human-to-human transmission was happening before the discovery. A pneumonia cluster was observed on 26 December and treated by Doctor Zhang Jixian. Vision Medicals reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus to the China CDC (CCDC) on 28 December. On 30 December, a test report from CapitalBio Medlab addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital reported an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing doctors there to alert authorities. On 31 December, the WHO office in China was informed of cases of the pneumonia cases and immediately launched an investigation. However, in May 2020, CCDC director George Gao indicated the market was not the origin (animal samples had tested negative). 2020 \n\nOn 11 January, WHO was notified by the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak was associated with exposures in the market, and that China had identified a new type of coronavirus, which it isolated on 7 January. Initially, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. On 10 January, the virus' genome was shared through GISAID. A 24 January report indicated human transmission, recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and advocated testing, given the outbreak's \"pandemic potential\". On 31 January the first published modelling study warned of inevitable \"independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally\" and called for \"large-scale public health interventions.\" On 30 January, 7,818 infections had been confirmed, leading WHO to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 11 March, WHO elevated it to a pandemic. By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections. Genomic analysis indicated that the majority of New York's confirmed infections came from Europe, rather than directly from Asia. Testing of prior samples revealed a person who was infected in France on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February. In October, WHO reported that one in ten people around the world may have been infected, or 780 million people, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed. That day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine. The variant, later named Alpha, showed changes to the spike protein that could be more infectious. 2021 \n\nOn 2 January, the Alpha variant, first discovered in the UK, had been identified in 33 countries. On 6 January, the Gamma variant was first identified in Japanese travellers returning from Brazil. On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link to thrombus, leading several countries to resume the vaccine. In March WHO reported that an animal host was the most likely origin, without ruling out other possibilities. The Delta variant was first identified in India. In mid-April, the variant was first detected in the UK and two months later it had metastasized into a third wave there, forcing the government to delay reopening that was originally scheduled for June. On 10 November, Germany advised against the Moderna vaccine for people under 30. On 24 November, the Omicron variant was detected in South Africa; a few days later the World Health Organization declared it a VoC (variant of concern). The new variant is more infectious than the Delta variant. 2022\n\nOn 1 January, Europe passed 100 million cases amidst a surge in the Omicron variant. On 14 January, the World Health Organization recommended two new treatments, Baricitinib, and Sotrovimab (although conditionally). On 24 January, it was reported that about 57% of the world has been infected by COVID-19, per the  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Model. However, cumulatively they had experienced only half the world average. The vaccines distributed in China included the BIBP, WIBP, and CoronaVac. It was reported on 11 December 2021 that China had vaccinated 1.162 billion of its citizens, or 82.5% of the total population of the country against COVID-19. However, since March 2020, China's large scale adoption of Zero-COVID has largely contained the disease, with external experts agreeing with the accuracy of China's infection numbers and deaths since the initial outbreak. The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. On 21 October 2021, it was reported that the country had surpassed 1 billion vaccinations. Military bases were quarantined after tests showed three infected soldiers. Despite some early criticisms, South Korea's programme was considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities. By 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic and it remained so until the WHO announced it has been overtaken by South America on 22 May. Despite deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021. On 10 November Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed infections. On 23 November, it was reported that the second wave of the virus had led some hospitals to stop accepting patients. The Swedish strategy focused on longer-term measures, based on the assumption that after lockdown the virus would resume spreading, with the same result. By the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality. confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with  deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On 13 May 2020, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of COVID-19 infection with 23,091 deaths. On 22 May 2020, citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the World Health Organization WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic. As of 16 July 2021, South America had recorded 34,359,631 confirmed cases and 1,047,229 deaths from COVID-19. Due to a shortage of testing and medical facilities, it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49,000 reported deaths. One estimate of under-reporting was 22.62% of total reported COVID-19 mortality in 2020. As of , Brazil, with  confirmed cases and  deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India. The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020. Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated. In early June 2021, Africa faced a third wave of COVID infections with cases rising in 14 countries. By 4 July the continent recorded more than 251,000 new COVID cases, a 20% increase from the prior week and a 12% increase from the January peak. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As a result of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant, however, by August 2021, the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts. Antarctica \n\nDue to its remoteness and sparse population, Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected directly by the pandemic. The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China. At least 36 people are confirmed to have been infected. Other responses \n\nThe pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, \"Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups.\" Travel restrictions \n\nThe pandemic led many countries and regions to impose quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, or for all travellers. The effectiveness of travel restrictions was questioned as the virus spread across the world. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to do so. On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative, while four who showed symptoms were left behind. WHO \n\nThe WHO spearheaded initiatives such as the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response, the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease. By contrast, petroleum products were in surplus at the beginning of the pandemic, as demand for gasoline and other products collapsed due to reduced commuting and other trips. The US intelligence community claimed that China intentionally under-reported its COVID-19 caseload. Some political analysts claimed that the pandemic contributed to President Donald Trump's 2020 defeat. Food systems \n\nThe pandemic disrupted food systems worldwide, hitting at a time when hunger/undernourishment was rising (an estimated 690 million people lacked food security in 2019). The pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions slowed movement of food aid. Per the World Health Organization 811 million individuals  were undernourished in 2020, \"likely related to the fallout of COVID-19\". They shed light on social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services. Health \n\nThe pandemic impacted global health for many other conditions. The pandemic impacted mental health, increasing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, affecting healthcare workers, patients and quarantined individuals. Environment \n\nThe pandemic and the reaction to it positively affected the environment and climate as a result of reduced human activity. Earth systems scientist Marshall Burke estimated that two months of pollution reduction likely saved the lives of 77,000 Chinese residents. Reports from February 2020 (when most confirmed cases were confined to China) cited racist sentiments about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus. This was attributed to their perceived vulnerability and subsequent physical and social isolation measures, which, coupled with their reduced social activity, increased dependency on others. Lifestyle changes \nThe pandemic triggered massive changes in behaviour, from increased Internet commerce to cultural changes in the job market. Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their pandemic-related articles and posts, Some scientific publishers made pandemic-related papers available with open access. Misinformation \n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic are widespread. WHO declared an \"infodemic\" of incorrect information. Cognitive biases, such as jumping to conclusions and confirmation bias, were linked to conspiracy beliefs.

The purpose of these injections is to supplement the lubricating properties of the synovial fluid in the joints, which helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. The injection involves the introduction of gel-like substances, called hyaluronates, into the affected joint. By increasing synovial fluid levels of HA, viscosupplementation injections have been effective in reducing pain by decreasing levels of inflammatory substances called prostaglandins. It is important to note that not all patients with osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation injections. Significant improvement in pain has been observed in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis. However, patients with advanced destructive osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain may not experience the same level of benefits. Please consult with a healthcare professional to determine whether viscosupplementation injections are a suitable option for your specific condition. Know what is Viscosupplementation injection for knee joint pain relief, is viscosupplementation effective, its side effects & costs, when is it recommended etc. Get clue about whether your joint pain can be treated with Viscosupplementation! For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. However, injecting hyaluronic acid into the affected joint is the most prevalent treatment technique. See this viscosupplementation injection video which displays the technique of injection with viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of right elbow joint. Is Viscosupplementation Effective for Knee Joint Pain? However, not all patients of osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation. Only those patients who have mild to moderate osteoarthritis have shown significant improvement in their pain condition. Those having advanced destructive osteoarthritis with chronic knee pain do not seem to have any beneficial effect from viscosupplement injections. When the patients of osteoarthritis with mild to moderate knee joint pain do not get any relief from the following traditional treatments, they are recommended by the doctors to take viscosupplementation treatment. Joint aspiration and intra-articular LA/steroid injection. Once taken, the viscosupplementation injection is effective for 6-8 months. What is the Cost for Viscosupplementation Injection? What are the Side Effects of Viscosupplementation? The side effects of viscosupplement injections are generally mild. The most common side effects are local reactions at the knee joint such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. Viscosupplementation treatment is, till date, available for treating knee joint pains only. Watch the video on viscosupplementation treatments in India for more information on the subject. Viscosupplementation is a medical procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee or other joints in patients whose pain has failed to respond to conservative approaches. Brand names of viscosupplementation solutions include Hylagan, Orthovisc, Supartz, and Synvisc – all of which we use at Unique Pain Medicine. INJECTIONS CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO KNEE SURGERY, WHILE OTHERS, RELY ON THESE INJECTIONS FOR RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CAUSED BY AN INJURY OR OSTEOARTHRITIS. A pre-filled syringe of viscosupplementation is then injected into the joint to help loosen the knee and reduce friction thereby decreasing pain, minimizing inflammation, and improving motion. This artificial lubrication will ideally “save” your knee from further deterioration, and help you to avoid surgery. Adds lubrication to the joint which restores movement and minimizes pain. Hip osteoarthritis (OA) and degeneration. What can go wrong with the knee joint? What are knee injections for pain? Knee injections treat knee pain, arthritis, osteoarthritis, swelling, and inflammation. Hyaluronan injections — also known as viscosupplementation — target only knee pain from osteoarthritis. If you are not getting relief from pain medications and other treatments, viscosupplementation knee injection may relieve your knee pain. This therapy increases the effectiveness of synovial fluid present in the knee joint. Usually, viscosupplementation knee injections are recommended to those patients who are not responding to exercise, physical therapy, or other medications. Viscosupplementation injections also provide improved knee joint mobility and joint range of motion. What is stem cell therapy for knee pain? There are no guidelines for the administration of corticosteroids, and they can be associated with increased risk of tendon rupture and infection. Viscosupplementation has gained popularity in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Traditional nonoperative treatment includes activity modification, weight loss, exercise, assistive devices, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs), analgesics, and corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is effective, but not indicated for early stages of the disease in all patients. In recent years, intraarticular viscosupplementation with hyaluronate-derived products has gained popularity as a modality for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The content of synovial fluid (lubricating fluid of joint), in the presence of osteoarthritis, has a decreased concentration and molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. Injections decrease inflammation and swelling, which decreases pain and increases joint mobility. There is no clear, objective evidence for intraarticular corticosteroid injections on the treatment of osteoarthritic or sports-related injuries of knees, ankles, shoulders, acromioclavicular joints, lumbar facet joints, and smaller hand and foot joints. Injections around joints are associated with significant risk. Corticosteroid injections could cause ligament and tendon rupture, which is the reason many orthopedists do not recommend corticosteroid injections in these locations. Active infection of the skin and overlying tissues increases the risk of inoculating the joint during injection. Other absolute contraindications are hypersensitivity, presence of a joint prosthesis, and uncontrolled bleeding diathesis. Relative contraindications include anticoagulation therapy, joint instability, poorly controlled diabetes, and adjacent skin abrasions. They are approved for use in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The most common side effects are local reactions of the knee such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. There are many stages of osteoarthritis, in various locations, and in different patient populations. They are relatively inexpensive and safe, but do not have clear, long-term benefits, and can damage collagen structures surrounding joints. Orthopedic surgeons need to continue to use corticosteroids cautiously and conservatively.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible.

What Are the Risks Associated With Heart Transplants? More than 2,000 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Each year thousands more would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available. People who have advanced (end stage) heart failure, but are otherwise healthy, may be considered for a heart transplant. Can you adhere to the lifestyle changes, including complex drug treatments and frequent exams, required after a transplant? If you answered 'no' to any of the above questions, a heart transplant may not be for you. Also, if you have additional medical problems, such as other severe diseases, active infections, or severe obesity, you most likely will not be considered a candidate for transplant. In order to get a heart transplant, you must first be placed on a transplant list. But, before you can be placed on the transplant list, you must go through a careful screening process. A team of heart doctors, nurses, social workers, and bioethicists review your medical history, diagnostic test results, social history, and psychological test results to see if you are able to survive the procedure and then comply with the continuous care needed to live a long, healthy life. Donors for heart transplants are individuals who may have recently died or become brain dead, which means that although their body is being kept alive by machines, the brain has no sign of life. Many times, these donors died as a result of a car accident, severe head injury, or a gunshot wound. Donor organs are located through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computerized national waiting list. This waiting list assures equal access and fair distribution of organs when they become available. When a heart becomes available for transplantation, it is given to the best possible match, based on blood type, body size, UNOS status (based on the recipient's medical condition), and the length of time the recipient has been waiting. The race and gender of the donor have no bearing on the match. All donors are screened for Hepatitis B and C and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unfortunately, not enough hearts are available for transplant. At any given time, almost 3,500 to 4,000 people are waiting for a heart or heart-lung transplant. A person may wait months for a transplant and more than 25% do not live long enough to get one. Many people who are waiting for transplantation have mixed feelings, because they are aware that someone must die before an organ becomes available. It may help to know that many donor families feel a sense of peace knowing that some good has come from their loved one's death. Once a donor heart becomes available, a surgeon from the transplant center surgically removes the heart from the donor's body. The surgeon will make sure the donor heart is in good condition before beginning the transplant surgery. The backs of the atria on the donor heart are opened and the heart is sewn into place. Most patients are up and around within a few days after surgery, and if there are no signs of the body immediately rejecting the organ, patients are allowed to go home within seven to 16 days. And many of them have no symptoms, such as angina, because they have no sensation in their donor hearts. Rejection occurs when the body's immune cells recognize the transplanted heart as different from the rest of the body and attempt to destroy it. If left alone, the immune system would damage the cells of a donor heart and eventually destroy it. To prevent rejection, patients receive several drugs called immunosuppressants. These drugs suppress the immune system so that the donor heart is not damaged. Because rejection can occur anytime after a transplant, immunosuppressive drugs are given to patients the day before their transplant and thereafter for the rest of their lives. To avoid rejection, heart transplant recipients must strictly adhere to their immunosuppressant drug regimen. Without an active enough immune system, a patient can easily develop severe infections. The Myocardial Biopsy: Heart transplant recipients are carefully monitored for signs of rejection. Doctors frequently take samples of small pieces of the transplanted heart to inspect under a microscope. It is vital for you to be aware of the possible signs of rejection and infection so you can report them to your health care providers and be treated immediately. With the exception of having to take lifelong medication to keep the body from rejecting the donor heart, many heart transplant recipients lead long and productive lives. The most important are those to keep the body from rejecting the transplant. To combat these problems, additional drugs are often prescribed. Heart transplant recipients are encouraged to exercise to improve the function of the heart and to avoid weight gain. However, due to changes in the heart related to the transplant, patients should speak to their doctor or cardiac rehabilitation specialist before beginning an exercise program. Because the nerves leading to the heart are cut during the operation, the transplanted heart beats faster (about 100 to 110 beats per minute) than the normal heart (about 70 beats per minute). After transplant, the patient may need to follow a special diet, which may involve many of the same dietary changes made prior to surgery. How long you live after a heart transplant depends on many factors, including age, general health, and response to the transplant. The 10-year survival rate is about 56%. In most cases, the costs related to a heart transplant are covered by health insurance. This section of the Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) website provides basic information to those waiting for an organ and tissue transplant and those that have received the gift of life. Putting plans in place to meet the needs of current and future transplants. Using electronic information and technology to support healthcare professionals to improve safety, quality and efficiency TGLN continues to grow the awareness and importance of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in the drive to save and enhance lives. There are hundreds of diseases that affect organs and tissues to the point that a transplant is required, but not everybody that suffers from disease requires one. Organs that can be transplanted are the liver, small bowel, kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung. This kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis. Transplanted livers can come from a deceased or living donor. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment options fail. Post surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Lung transplant surgery can replace one or both diseased lungs. Lungs can come from either a deceased or living donor. A transplant may be recommended if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases, or primary pulmonary hypertension, among others. As with other transplants, you must take medication to prevent your body from rejecting the new heart. Islet cell transplantation replaces only the part of the pancreas that makes insulin. Transplanted islet cells come from deceased donors. People who have transplants must take medication to keep their body from rejecting the new organ. After surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Tissue transplantation includes corneas, skin, bone, cardiovascular tissue the islet cells of the pancreas and connective tissue. One donor can provide tissue for many recipients undergoing various procedures. Skin is one of the most common types of tissue transplanted. Some people think that age determines whether they can register to donate their skin - The fact is, everyone is a potential donor. One of the most successful achievements in the history of medicine is in the world of transplantation. Canada is still faced with a greater need for organs and tissue than the number available for transplantation. Canada’s first successful kidney transplant is done between identical twins in Montreal, Quebec. Islet cells are transplanted into a patient with Diabetes in Edmonton, Alberta (now called the Edmonton Protocol). First living-related double lung transplant, where two people each donated part of a lung in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canada’s first adult to adult living-related liver transplant in London, Ontario. “Halifax Protocol” – the successful combination of two anti- rejection drugs that drastically reduces organ rejection – earns international attention in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Even though the list of people waiting for a lifesaving or transforming transplant continues to be long, the success rates for transplants continue to improve each year. If you are thinking about transplantation or are already on the organ/tissue transplant waiting list, you probably have lots of questions. The following pages provide a few basic answers to help you as you move through your transplantation journey. Don’t be afraid to raise any questions with your healthcare team at your transplant centre. Find a designated transplant centre near you by clicking the pins on the map of Ontario. Once you and your primary care physician have discussed transplantation as an option and agreed to move forward, you will be referred to a team of specialists in the Transplant Centre. You will be invited to meet the specialists at the Transplant Program to determine your suitability for transplantation. If the results of your assessment indicate that you are a suitable candidate and you determine to move forward for transplantation, you will be placed on the waitlist. The specialists along with other healthcare professionals are part of the transplant team that will be treating you throughout your journey. Should transplantation be deemed unneeded or unsafe, alternative options will be presented to you. Do I have a choice other than transplantation? What are the organ and patient survival rates for my type of transplant at this hospital? How many of my type of transplant do you perform each year? When an organ is available for transplant how do you decide who will get it? Does the hospital do living donor transplants? Is a living donor transplant a choice in my case? Once you and your transplant team have agreed to pursue transplantation, you will be placed on the waitlist. Once a donor organ is deemed suitable there is a matching system to ensure that the distribution of organs is based on fair criteria. These may include suitable blood type match, medical urgency, the amount of time already spent on the waiting list, the size of the organ(s) needed, and other factors. Since an organ can become available at any time, it is important to stay as healthy as possible. Your transplant team and primary care physician will be able to help. Many patients waiting for heart, heart-lung or lung transplantation face financial barriers in accessing transplantation. The Transplant Patient Expense Reimbursement (TPER) program, funded by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, was created to relieve some of the financial burden to the patient. The program provides reimbursement to transplant patients for limited accommodation-related expenses. If the transplant hospital requires the patient to temporarily relocate closer to the transplant hospital to access a life-saving transplant, some of the costs for the patient may be covered. Carefully plan your transplant and be sure to include your caregivers and family in this process. Support and preparatory tools are available through your Transplant Program. The Transplant Program may be calling you regarding an available organ. Transplantation is major surgery and it will probably take time before you are managing your own care. Having a functioning transplant may provide a completely different view on life for you. The length of hospital stay after the surgery will vary by patient and type of transplant. Shortly after discharge from the hospital, you will begin to make frequent visits to the Transplant Program for follow-up examinations. Maintaining an active lifestyle will keep your body and new organs healthy. Check with your transplant team before you begin any exercise program. Prior to returning you will need to receive permission from your transplant team. You may experience an episode of rejection, which refers to when your body attacks the newly transplanted organ. Your transplant team knows how to manage rejection with medication. After treatment, most people live normally with their transplanted organ. Talk with your transplant team should you have any questions. After your transplant, and as you feel better, you may be able to handle more of these issues on your own. Talk to your transplant team. Speak to your transplant team for more information. When the time is right you may want to express your feelings to your donor’s family. Consider writing a letter to the donor family and let them know how grateful you feel. In Canada, the identities of the recipient, the donor and both their families are kept confidential out of respect for everyone’s right to personal privacy. Organ donation from one individual can help up to 8 others. Living Donation occurs when a living person donates an organ or part of an organ for transplant to another person in need. It is one of the most important sources of organs for transplantation. This is why it is critically important to encourage colleagues, friends and family to consider registering their consent to organ and tissue donation. Living donors are most often family members or close friends of the recipient. Other types of living donation are available and include anonymous donation, list exchange and paired exchange. Living donation has the potential to reduce wait times to a matter of months rather than possibly years for deceased donation. Typically, the organ donated by a living donor is healthier at the time of the operation. This often leads to a better-functioning organ and longer graft survival. From the donor’s perspective, there is often a sense of pride in saving or improving the life of another. To minimize the potential financial burdens associated with the living donation process, the Government of Ontario established the Program for Reimbursing Expenses of Living Organ Donors (PRELOD). Potential and actual Living Organ Donors may apply to PRELOD for reimbursement of eligible expenses. For hard copy versions of the application forms, please visit your Transplant Hospital. Living donors are blood relatives. Living donors are spouses, partners, in-law relatives, close friends, and co-workers. Paired exchange is when two separate but willing donors are each unable to donate to their intended recipients due to blood group (ABO) incompatibility or more rarely because of incompatibility of cross matching. The willing donors are matched with the other's respective recipient so that each recipient can receive a kidney with a compatible blood type. The Living Donor Paired Exchange (LDPE) registry is administered by Canadian Blood Services. The first step for anyone wishing to be an anonymous donor is to contact the transplant coordinator at the transplant hospital nearest to them. For more information, please see the Canadian Blood Services website: Living Donation. In Ontario, the majority of people waiting for an organ transplant are waiting for a kidney. Although transplantation - from either a living or a deceased donor - is not a cure for kidney disease, it may prolong and enhance one's quality of life. Living kidney donors must be older than 18 and generally less than 70 years of age, in good general health without any evidence of significant high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and heart disease or hepatitis. Gender and race are not factors in determining who can donate. This decision to offer to donate is yours alone to make. Speak with the social worker or counselor affiliated with the transplant team or a living donation coordinator. When a potential donor has access to another living donor and others such as living donor support groups, they are better prepared to make a decision. While the consequences of donating a kidney are minimal and few, there are some precautions that should be taken. Any kidney donor who becomes pregnant after donating should let her physician know so that as a precaution, kidney function can be monitored. The potential donor must be in good overall health and physical condition, have a liver that is the right size for the recipient and have a blood type that is compatible with the recipient. The other consideration is that the donor must have a Body Mass Index of < 35 to be worked up for consideration of being a liver donor. It is important that you discuss your decision to donate with the transplant team, a living donation coordinator, as well as with the recipient and the families involved. The transplant team will determine whether or not you are mentally, emotionally and physically fit to become a donor. The good news is that the evaluation process takes place in stages, leaving time between appointments for a donor to discuss any questions or concerns as they arise. If at any time you decide that donating is not for you, you should inform your contact on the transplant team right away. The Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) and the Ontario Renal Network (ORN) has partnered to improve access to living donation and kidney transplantation for all Ontario patients with chronic kidney disease. Establishing a provincial network of local Quality Improvement Teams that includes care providers from Regional Renal Programs, their affiliated Transplant Program, and patients and families.

It was made possible by advanced life support technology, a dedicated and diverse surgical, respirology, intensive care and perfusion team, as well as the grit and gumption of the patient, Melissa Benoit, and her close-knit family. \"This was bold and very challenging, but Melissa was dying before our eyes,\" recalls Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, Surgeon-in-Chief, Sprott Department of Surgery at UHN, one of three thoracic surgeons who operated together on Melissa to remove both her lungs. \"Melissa gave us the courage to go ahead.\" For the past three years, Melissa, who has cystic fibrosis, had been prescribed antibiotics to fight off increasingly frequent chest infections. A recent bout of influenza just before her hospital admission had left Melissa gasping for air, with coughing fits so harsh that she fractured her ribs. As Dr. Niall Ferguson, Head of Critical Care Medicine at UHN and Mount Sinai Hospital, describes it, the influenza \"tipped her over the edge into respiratory failure. Her only hope of recovery was a lung transplant.\" Melissa's oxygen levels dipped so low, conventional ventilation was no longer enough. Despite this, Melissa's condition worsened. The bacteria in her lungs developed resistance to most antibiotics, and spread throughout her body. Melissa was now on maximum doses of three medications to maintain her blood pressure, along with the most advanced respiratory support, and on last-line powerful antibiotics, the last option for patients resistant to other available antibiotics. The team was still waiting for donor lungs but, by this time, Melissa was too sick to have a lung transplant. Removing both her lungs – the source of bacterial infection – could save her life. Dr. Cypel gathered his colleagues, calling in Dr. Keshavjee, Dr. Tom Waddell, Head of Thoracic Surgery at UHN, Dr. Ferguson, and respirologist Dr. Mathew Binnie – all seasoned and well-known for their skills in navigating complex cases, along with Melissa's husband, mom and dad. The surgical team had been discussing the concept of this procedure for several years. They had observed patients with cystic fibrosis, waiting for a lung transplant, who developed severe lung infections. While the team faced many unknowns – risk of bleeding into an empty chest cavity, whether her blood pressure and oxygen levels could be supported afterwards, and if she would even survive the operation – they agreed that Melissa was a possible candidate, and that it was her only chance, although a slim one. As Dr. Keshavjee explained, she likely still had enough strength to withstand the procedure and get better afterwards; the source of the infection was clear-cut and difficult to control in current circumstances; the family understood the risks and explained that Melissa had often told them she would want to try everything possible to live for her husband, Chris, and two-year-old daughter, Olivia. \"Things were so bad for so long, we needed something to go right,\" remembers, Chris, \"and this new procedure was the first piece of good news in a long time. As Melissa tells it, Chris was the one who \"held my life in his hands...He had to trust in himself, knowing me, relying on past conversations, and he chose exactly what I would have told him to.\" Melissa's mom, Sue, was so eager to save her daughter's life, she urged the team to go ahead: \"Melissa always volunteers for any study or clinical trial. Cypel, Keshavjee and Waddell - removed Melissa's lungs, one at a time, in a nine-hour procedure. To keep Melissa alive, she was placed on the most sophisticated support possible for her heart and lungs. Two external life support circuits were connected to her heart via tubes placed through her chest. Six days later, a pair of donor lungs became available and Melissa was stable enough to receive a lung transplant in late April 2016. The medical team is developing criteria for the select types of patients who could be candidates for this novel procedure while waiting for a lung transplantation. Please review the Heart Failure Manual, Heart Transplant Manual , glossary and list of frequently asked questions. Heart failure is almost always a chronic illness. Transplantation becomes necessary when the recipient's organ has failed or has been damaged through illness or injury. What questions should I ask about the cost of transplantation? What part of the transplant cost is covered by my insurance? If a living donor transplant is a choice in my case, where will the living donor evaluation be done? Do transplant hospitals in the U.S. only perform transplants on U.S. citizens? Patients from other countries may travel here to receive transplants. Once accepted by a UNOS transplant center, international patients receive organs based on the same policies as U.S. citizens. An organ is donated. When the organ becomes available, the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) managing the donor sends information to the (United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The Transplant Team considers the organ for the patient. When the team is offered an organ, it bases its acceptance or refusal of the organ upon established medical criteria, organ condition, candidate condition, patient availability, and organ transportation. By policy, the transplant team has only one hour to make its decision. Receive a referral for transplant evaluation from your physician. Schedule an appointment for evaluation to determine if you are a good candidate for transplant. The hospital's transplant team will decide whether you are a good transplant candidate. If after evaluation, the transplant team determines that you are a good transplant candidate, they will add you to the national waiting list. There is no set amount of time, and there is no way to know how long, a patient must wait to receive a donor organ. Factors that affect waiting times are patient medical status, and the level of match between the donor and recipient. The organs are distributed locally first, and if no match is found they are then offered regionally, and then nationally, until a recipient is found. Every attempt is made to place donor organs.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Studies have shown that bisphosphonate medications like Bondronat may increase the risk of atypical femur fractures and a disfiguring jaw injury known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Bondronat Bone Fracture Update 5/24/12: In a study published this week by the Archives of Internal Medicine, Swiss researchers reached conclusions similar to those reached earlier this month by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) – that taking osteoporosis drugs from the bisphosphonate class can increase the risk of atypical bone fractures. Taken cumulatively, the results of the study seem to suggest that the risk of fractures increased over time while the benefits of the drugs decreased. Osteoporosis is a chronic debilitating disease that affects approximately 45 million people nationwide, typically affecting post-menopausal women by decreasing the density and strength of bones. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to severe fractures of the spine, hip and thigh. As the population of our nation continues to age, so too will the number of people suffering from the effects of osteoporosis continue to increase. Drugs from the bisphosphonate class are designed to bind tightly to tissue, thereby preventing calcium from being removed and sustaining bone density. However, he added, \"The fracture risk goes right back up once you stop it. Previous studies have found that women on tamoxifen have increased bone mineral density. And patients taking tamoxifen, compared to another class of breast cancer drugs, aromatase inhibitors, have a reduced risk of fracture. Current use of tamoxifen reduced osetoporosis-related fracture risk overall by 32 percent and reduced hip fractures by 53 percent. Breast cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for osteoporosis and all types of fractures because of the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat the disease. It is often used to treat patients with early stage breast cancer and those whose cancer has spread. They work by lowering the amount of estrogen in the body but have been associated with decreased bone density, upping fracture risk. \"We have known from large breast cancer trials comparing tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors that the fracture rates were higher in [those who got] aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen,\" she said. \"But we had not known whether the fracture rate on tamoxifen was lower than in women not being given tamoxifen and given nothing. Russell said the study results may cause some doctors to rethink when they prescribe tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer, said the take-home message from the new study was this: \"If you switch from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors, or if you stop tamoxifen, you must be aware your osteoporosis risk may increase.\" Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility, and consequent increase in fracture risk. Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms\n\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable\n\n The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable\n Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis   A meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia (softening of the bone). Medical disorders\n\nMany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown. For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute. People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis. Chronic kidney disease can lead to renal osteodystrophy. Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Several inherited or genetic disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome, Multicentric Osteolysis, Nodulosis, and Arthropathy, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher's disease. People with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. People with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk of broken bones. Medication\nCertain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs. Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Barbiturates, phenytoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D.\n L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribute to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism. Anticoagulants – long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use. Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. Pathogenesis\n\nThe underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age. :58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:\n\nThe International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Screening\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old. Prevention\n\nLifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death, an increased risk of myocardial infarctions  kidney stones, and stomach problems is associated with calcium supplementation,\n\nVitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Physical exercise \nThere is limited evidence indicating that exercise is helpful in promoting bone health. There is some evidence that physical exercise may be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Neither contribute to slowing bone loss with age, and professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density. Low-quality evidence suggests that exercise may improve pain and quality of life of people with vertebral fractures and there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise will likely improve physical performance in individuals with vertebral fractures. Physical therapy \nPeople with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Management\n\nLifestyle\nWeight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Medications \n\nBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis. Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Prognosis\n\nAlthough people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal. Fractures\nHip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing. Epidemiology\n\nIt is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. Postmenopausal women have a higher rate of osteoporosis and fractures than older men. Postmenopausal women have decreased estrogen which contributes to their higher rates of osteoporosis. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture. It has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. There is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually for related healthcare costs. History\nThe link between age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term osteoporosis. \"It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition\", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.

Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms\n\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable\n\n The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable\n Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis   A meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia (softening of the bone). Medical disorders\n\nMany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown. For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute. People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy).

Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. Pathogenesis\n\nThe underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age. :58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:\n\nThe International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Screening\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old. Prevention\n\nLifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death, an increased risk of myocardial infarctions  kidney stones, and stomach problems is associated with calcium supplementation,\n\nVitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Physical exercise \nThere is limited evidence indicating that exercise is helpful in promoting bone health. There is some evidence that physical exercise may be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Neither contribute to slowing bone loss with age, and professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density. Low-quality evidence suggests that exercise may improve pain and quality of life of people with vertebral fractures and there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise will likely improve physical performance in individuals with vertebral fractures. Physical therapy \nPeople with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Management\n\nLifestyle\nWeight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Medications \n\nBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis. Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Prognosis\n\nAlthough people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal. Fractures\nHip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing. Epidemiology\n\nIt is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. Postmenopausal women have a higher rate of osteoporosis and fractures than older men. Postmenopausal women have decreased estrogen which contributes to their higher rates of osteoporosis. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture. It has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. Diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference, as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone mineral density. There is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually for related healthcare costs. History\nThe link between age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term osteoporosis. \"It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition\", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Newer fluorescent lights without magnetic ballasts have essentially eliminated flicker. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. An open (single envelope) CFL. Some fluorescent lamps emit ultraviolet radiation. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Not all open CFLs produce significant UV emissions. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom recommend that in situations requiring close proximity to the light source, open (single envelope) CFLs be replaced with encapsulated (double envelope) CFLs. Ultraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. Melanoma has been shown to not be affected by CFLs through normal use. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Fluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clear up a broken fluorescent bulb. Several countries have specialised recycling or disposal systems for fluorescent bulbs, e.g. The U.S. EPA states that using energy-efficient CFLs reduces demand for power, which reduces the amount of coal burned by power plants and hence reduces the amount of mercury emitted from coal fired power plants. Standard acrylic diffusers over the fluorescent lamps absorb nearly all the UV-B radiation and appear to protect against this. The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines,[dead link] and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences. \"The effects of fluorescent and incandescent illumination upon repetitive behaviors in autistic children\". ^ \"Philips Tornado Asian Compact Fluorescent\". ^ \"Emissions from compact fluorescent lights\". ^ \"Executive Summary: Report on Health Canada Survey of Ultraviolet Radiation and Electric and Magnetic Fields from Compact Fluorescent Lamps\" (PDF). Although the carcinogenic UV dose from fluorescent lighting in offices is minor (~ 1%) when compared to equal exposure times in the summer sun, old risk assessments showed that actual annual exposures of office workers could increase by 10 to 30% from the fluorescent lighting, which over a lifetime was estimated to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinomas by around 4% with a baseline risk much lower than that for outdoor workers who dominate incidences (Lytle et al. ^ Mattsson M-O; et al. ^ , US Environmental Protection Agency. ^ \"Fluorescent Lamp Disposal and Recycling\" (PDF).

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that \"The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs\" and thus are safe medicines. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000.\" Proponents argue that research by the Guttmacher Institute, involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. He was found to be profoundly hypokalaemic with a serum potassium level of 1.4 mmol ⁄ l. He had been drinking 4l of Coca-Cola per day over the past 3 years, and drank up to 10l to slake his thirst when he went for kangaroo-shooting at night. He was advised to curtail his cola drinking, and his potassium level normalised, his weakness resolved, and he made a full recovery (1). I asked him how much he drank, and he said that he sipped it continuously, 4l per day. He was not willing to stop drinking cola, but he did agree to reduce his intake to 2l per day. Sugar sweetened soft drinks have been shown to cause obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental decay and metabolic syndrome. They appear also to increase the risk for osteoporosis, gout, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, hypovitaminosis C, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The only therapeutic use of soft drinks is described in a few case reports of the successful use of Coca-Cola to dissolve phytobezoars. In their review of cola-induced hypokalaemia, Tsimihodimos et al. make a compelling argument that potassium depletion should be added to the long list of soft drink-related health problems. In the cases they describe, chronic consumption of 3–10l of sugar-sweetened cola per day led to severe hypokalaemia, hypokalaemic myopathy, and in some cases, hypokalaemic paralysis. One patient developed hypokalaemic nephropathy and subsequent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In all cases, the patients’ symptoms improved, and the hypokalaemia resolved with potassium repletion and reduction or cessation of cola drinking. Second, drinks containing large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup send boluses of largely indigestible fructose into the GI tract, which causes potassium wasting via an osmotic diarrhoea. Third, caffeine has been shown to cause beta adrenergic stimulation, increase Na+⁄K+-ATPase via cellular phosphodiesterase inhibition, and produce metabolic alkalosis, diuresis and increased renin levels, all of which may contribute to hypokalaemia. Based on case reports of hypokalaemia from both caffeine-free soft drinks and caffeine products (such as coffee and tea) without sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, any or all of the above mechanisms may be at work in various individuals drinking various beverages. However, soft drinks that combine large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup with caffeine, such as regular colas, might deplete potassium stores more effectively because of concurrent osmotic and caffeine-mediated potassium wasting. One might argue that people who drink 3–10l of cola per day are outliers, and that excessive soft drink consumption at this level is so rare that it is not a public health issue. Consider, too, the marketing of the soft drink. With aggressive mass marketing, super-sizing of soft drinks, and the effects of caffeine tolerance and dependence, there is very little doubt that tens of millions of people in industrialised countries drink at least 2–3l of cola per day. As our heavy cola drinkers age and develop obesity, hypertension and diabetes, they will become more vulnerable to the potentially lethal effects of chronic hypokalaemia. Another concern is that even moderate chronic cola consumption has been found to be associated with CKD. A comparison of 465 patients with newly diagnosed CKD and 467 community controls in North Carolina showed a twofold increased risk of CKD in patients who drank two or more cola drinks (16 ounces) per day (9). Most government responses to soft drink health concerns have focused on protecting children from youth-targeted advertising and in school vending machines. This same focus seems to hold in the medical profession, where paediatricians are generally more aware of the health risks of soft drinks, and probably more likely than internists to discuss them with their patients. In addition to the usual questions about alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use, internists need to start asking their adult patients about soft drink consumption. Cola drinks need to be added to the physician’s checklist of drugs and substances (such as liquorice) that can cause hypokalaemia. More work is needed on the epidemiology of cola consumption, hypokalaemia and cardiovascular disease rates. Ann Intern Med 1986; 105: 468.\nstudy. Arch Intern Med 2002; 162: 1007–12. N Engl J Med 1998; 339: 451–8. Clin Nephrol 2005; 63: 181–7. The study suggests that by increasing insulin, soft drinks could also increase the risk of cancer developing. Interestingly those who drank fruit juice, which is also high in sugar, didn’t have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. “The sugar load and resultant weight gain increases the risk of heart disease,” Jamieson says. Women who consume three or more cola-based drinks a day have almost 4 per cent lower bone density than those who drink non-cola based drinks, thereby increasing their risk of osteoporosis, according to Tufts University in the US. The phosphoric acid in cola can leech calcium from bones, while “caffeine is known to be associated with the risk of lower bone mineral density”, Tucker added. evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President Barack Obama had been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms. On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics. Among the proposals: Scientists have started using advanced computational approaches with supercomputers for the development of new antibiotic derivatives to deal with antimicrobial resistance. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\" A few antibiotics have received marketing authorization in the last seven years. • Ceftolozane/tazobactam (CXA-201; CXA-101/tazobactam): Antipseudomonal cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor \n\nFew deliberations have greater bearing on human health than when the Food and Drug Administration weighs the risks and benefits of drugs designed to treat life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. If the scale is tipped on the side of benefits, the drug is approved and allowed on the U.S. market. Patients, doctors, caregivers, and family members must also weigh the risks and benefits of drugs to decide which treatments to use. Cancer drugs are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. Under the acts, the FDA may approve a new drug for marketing in the United States if it is supported by substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness demonstrated in adequate and well-controlled studies. The drug's manufacturer or marketer must show this evidence by submitting an application to the FDA that includes results from studies of the drug's use in people (clinical trials). FDA oncologists and other agency experts review cancer drug applications and evaluate the study results. When seeking outside advice regarding drug approval or drug labeling. the FDA calls upon the expertise of a group of leading cancer specialists, clinical practitioners, and patient representatives who make up the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC). At an ODAC meeting, the pharmaceutical company presents findings from clinical trials on safety and effectiveness of the drug, and FDA staff present their assessments after reviewing the drug application, which includes extensive documentation about the drug's chemistry. its proposed use for one or more specific purposes, and data from clinical trials. The ODAC carefully considers the presentations and votes on questions posed by the FDA intended to guide the agency in its decision to approve or not approve the drug for marketing or for a new claim. the commercial sponsor may show that the drug works better than an inactive substance (placebo). but generally does not have to show that it works as well or better than other drugs on the market to treat the same illness. Studies involving cancer drugs usually do not use placebos, says Patricia Cortazar, M.D., an oncologist in the FDA's Office of Oncology Drug Products. \"Because cancer is a life-threatening illness, it would not be ethical to give placebo when something better than placebo is available.\" \"The standard of care changes over time as new drugs or drug combinations that are shown to be better become available,\" says Cortazar. The FDA may approve a drug for several uses (indications). If a drug is approved for one indication. it must still be shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective before the FDA will approve it for another indication. In 2006, Erbitux was approved to treat patients with head and neck cancer whose cancer is inoperable. To support a claim to treat colorectal cancer, Erbitux's manufacturer. Recently, a pharmaceutical company requested that the FDA approve its drug for a second indication without conducting additional clinical trials to show an effect on cancer in this new indication. The FDA usually requires randomized clinical trials for diseases that affect a large number of people. Abraxis stated that its drug contained the same active ingredient as Taxol, a cancer drug approved both for metastatic breast cancer and for adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, the indication for which Abraxis was seeking approval. The FDA told the ODAC that Taxol and Abraxane were distinctly different. \"The two drugs have different formulations and different infusion rates,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA's Office of Oncology Drug Products. \"They have different toxicity profiles. increases the probability that a person will remain alive without the disease getting worse (progression-free survival). In short, FDA cancer drug reviewers ask, \"Does the drug prolong life, control the disease, or relieve symptoms1 And does the scientific evidence support it?\" These benefits are weighed against the risks of the drug. No drug is absolutely safe—all have some risks, or potential side effects. Yet highly toxic effects may be considered acceptable if the benefits are important and the disease is very serious or life-threatening. The FDA considered these risks to be tolerable for a drug that had the benefit of delaying tumor growth or death nearly three months longer than in patients who received no anti-cancer therapy in clinical trials, but these risks would not be tolerated in a drug to treat a less serious condition. The FDA does not require a specific number of participants in a clinical trial. the FDA does not require a specific number of patients to respond to a cancer drug, nor does it require the drug to extend life by a specific numher of days so long as t he results are convincing and clinically meaningful given the side effects of the drug and other treatment options. \"The agency looks at data and makes judgments about what's clinically significant and whether, on baIance, the benefits exceed the risks.\" For a drug to treat a common cancer. But the FDA would consider a drug for rare cancers tested in a small number of people. The FDA may approve a use for a drug if the drug shows evidence that people live longer or live without the disease getting worse for a certain period of time, even if it's just a few weeks or a few months. In addition to evaluating data from clinical trials, the FDA may look at X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or even photographs that a pharmaceutical company provides to establish whether a drug is truly effective. The pharmaceutical company was also required to submit measurements of the lesions and classification of their severity. These decisions can be very difficult, especially when a person is first diagnosed, says Patty Delaney, director of the Cancer Liaison Program in the FDA's Office of Special Health Issues, and two-time cancer survivor. Patients who don't respond to the standard-of-care treatments also are faced with hard decisions, says Delaney. \"Sometimes there's not very strong data in the literature on what to do. The FDA recognizes that many patients, like Kelly, run out of options and are willing to risk taking unproven treatments. The agency has put in place a number of regulatory programs and works with manufacturers so that seriously ill patients can get access to promising, but not fully evaluated, products. The patient's data would not be analyzed with the primary data from the original trial, but would be evaluated separately. Usually, such exceptions occur in the same institutions that are conducting the original trial. where investigators are familiar with the drug. The pharmaceutical company must be willing to provide the new drug to the patient. This provision can be expensive and time-consuming for the company since it must track shipments of the drug, create special instructions for its use, and devise a way to collect information on toxic side effects for each patient. • The patient must give informed consent, understanding that the drug is not approved and may cause known and unknown side effects ranging from mild to fatal. The patient's physician must be willing to take responsibility for treating the patient and agree to collect information about the effects of the drug. proper clinical trials are well under way to see whether the drug really does offer patients any benefit. The FDA cannot force a pharmaceutical company to give an individual patient an investigational drug outside of its planned clinical trials. The drug manufacturer makes the final decision to provide an experimental treatment to a patient. The company may consider many factors, including the amount of information available about the drug, the amount of drug available, and how best to use its resources to optimize development of the drug. In some cases, the company is unwilling to provide the product outside of clinical trials. The tools provide details specific to a condition, a breakdown of treatment options and side effects, personalized reports with pros and cons of treatment, and questions to ask the doctor. As with drugs for adults, the FDA weighs the risks and benefits of drugs for children based on clinical trials. Sometimes, in lieu of conducting randomized trials in children to demonstrate the effectiveness of a drug, the FDA may extrapolate findings from adult trials of a drug that might also be promising for children. This action may be taken when the disease being treated is similar between adults and children. For example, in 2003, the FDA approved Cleevec (imatinib mesylate) for the treatment of children who have a rare, life-threatening form of leukemia. As a condition of approval, the manufacturer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., agreed to conduct pediatric studies after approval to confirm that the drug improves survival or provides other clinical benefits in children. Doctors and patients need to be aware of the potential for later health problems, says Rosoff, who authored an editorial in the same journal. When it comes to treating cancer, Rosoff adds, \"A concern about late effects is a luxury of cure. No physician or patient would sacrifice a percentage point of cure for a percentage point of late effects.\" Once a medication is approved, the FDA monitors the medication and collects information on side effects including late effects, rare effects, and long-term effects. This postmarketing surveillance program is an important complement to the premarketing assessment because the agency cannot anticipate all possible effects of a drug during clinical trials that precede a drug's approval. Through its continuous monitoring of medical products, the FDA ensures that new safety information is quickly communicated to medical professionals and patients.

However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. If medical treatment is not effective, surgery may need to be performed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. There are two types of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the standard monopolar and the newer bipolar procedure. A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies that included 8924 men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably results in comparable improvements urinary symptoms, as well as a similar erectile function, the incidence of urinary incontinence and the need for retreatment. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects. Minimally invasive therapies\nMinimally invasive therapies can offer faster recovery compared with traditional prostate surgery. A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel. Another instrument is then used to cut the prostate tissue into small pieces that are easily removed. Three 2015 reviews found that HoLEP is superior to TURP in some respects and for some patients. Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT. Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra. Transurethral needle ablation \nTransurethral needle ablation (TUNA) operates with a different type of energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, but is designed along the same premise as TUMT devices, that the heat the device generates will cause necrosis of the prostatic tissue and shrink the prostate. The energy is delivered into the prostate using two needles that emerge from the sides of the device, through the urethral wall and into the prostate. The treatment is typically performed in one session, but may require multiple sticks of the needles depending on the size of the prostate. The most recent American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines for the Treatment of BPH from 2018 stated that \"TUNA is not recommended for the treatment of LUTS/BPH\". Water vapor thermal therapy \nWater vapour thermal therapy (marketed as Rezum) is a newer office procedure for removing prostate tissue using steam. Several studies including a four-year follow-up provided evidence for improvement of BPH symptoms, preserved sexual function, and low surgical retreatment rates. It consists of placing small hooks that compress the prostate tissue to open the urinary stream without cutting or removing tissue. This procedure likely improves quality of life without additional negative side effects when compared with a sham surgery. Compared with transurethral resection of the prostate, the standard surgery for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, this procedure may be less effective in reducing urinary symptoms but may preserve ejaculation and have fewer unwanted effects on erections. Temporary implantable nitinol device \nTemporary implantable nitinol device (marketed as TIND and iTIND) is a device that is placed in the urethra that, when released, is expanded, reshaping reshaping the urethra and the bladder neck. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the treatment of BPH from 2018 list minimally invasive therapies including TUMT - but not TUNA - as acceptable alternatives for certain patients with BPH. However, the European Association of Urology (EAU) has - as of 2019 - removed both TUMT and TUNA from its guidelines. Complications of Prostate Surgery \nThe two most feared complications of prostate surgery are erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. The type of complications depend on the treatment modality used:\n Urinary incontinence can happen after prostate surgery, especially stress urinary incontinence. If the problem persists, conservative management is the first line treatment. This includes lifestyle modifications, kegel exercises, and bladder training. About 50% of patients who undergo prostatectomy will have some degree of erectile dysfunction. Recommended:\n Urolift System\n Aquablation therapy\n Prostate steam treatment\n\nNot recommended:\n High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\n\nGeneral prospects of surgery success \nThe success of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) – as measured by a significant reduction of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) – strongly depends on a reliable (unequivocal) pre-surgery diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). If BPH with obstruction additionally presents with overactive bladder (OAB), which is the case in about 50% of patients, this latter symptom (OAB) persists even post-surgery in about 20% of patients.

It was last used in 1944. In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. Dr. Craig Philips also added that though the results need to be confirmed through much bigger study. He also said that there might be an influence in the body clock in this issue as it has the tendency or the urge to push the blood fat levels during these times in the wee hours of midnight. He also said that the workers who have night shift jobs are more prone to such cardiovascular conditions. Rania Paula, Author of this article writes for www.ehealthyblog.com.

As this all seems pretty bad, what are the chances you will get Insomnias? It overall depends on your stressing levels, sleeps habits, and agings. In the end around 35% of Americans have Insomnia. For example, at some point in the time zone transition, your brain might be in the time zone of Sydney, Australia; your heart in Hawaii; and your liver still in Los Angeles. It is important to note that approximately 16 percent of the U.S. and European workforces undertake some form of shift work. Further, this response is likely to be time-of-day specific, and the phase response curve to medium treatment that the authors generated in vitro would also predict at what time of the 24-hour day such shifts might occur. The work was funded by grants from the American Heart Association and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Information on the University of Geneva group’s research can be found here. Many of us start the day with a small breakfast as we run out the door, followed by a medium sized lunch and a large dinner. However, while what we eat is important, a growing body of research suggests when we eat matters too. While you have likely heard of the circadian rhythm, the master \"clock\" in the brain that governs our sleep-wake cycle, we actually have a variety of circadian clocks that govern the daily cycle of activity for every organ. These rhythms exist because every organ needs downtime for repair and regeneration. Even our gut microbiome operates on a daily rhythm. Circadian clocks optimize our health by aligning our biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns. Disrupting our circadian clocks — such as by skipping breakfast or eating at midnight — can result in health issues such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and more. About 20 to 30 percent of American adults skip breakfast. Some do it to save time, many do it in an effort to lose weight. However, studies show that people who eat breakfast daily are less likely to be obese, malnourished, suffer from impaired blood sugar metabolism, or be diagnosed with diabetes. Even the American Heart Association recently endorsed biologically appropriate meal timing to reduce the risk of heart disease. Just eating breakfast isn't the only important thing however. The timing in relation to the size of our meals is also important. This is partially because insulin, a hormone that helps with blood sugar control, appears to be most efficient in the morning. In addition, we burn more calories and digest food more efficiently in the morning than later in the day when most of us eat our largest meal. According to the researchers, a high‐calorie breakfast and a reduced calorie dinner is beneficial and might be a useful alternative for managing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Most of us eat meals and snack from the time we wake up until shortly before bed — or even in the middle of the night. Researchers put a group of prediabetic men through two eating cycles. Then in another phase, they ate the same meals in a time-restricted six-hour window starting in the morning. At night, the lack of sunlight signals our brain to release melatonin, the hormone that prepares us for sleep. In the morning, the light stops melatonin production and we wake up. When we change that signaling — whether from a late-night meal, artificial lighting at night (especially blue screen light), shift work, flying and travel, or changing our eating patterns — it confuses our bodies' circadian clocks. Shift workers, who account for about 20 percent of the country’s work force, have a particular problem with disturbed circadian clocks. Many frequently work overnight shifts, forcing them to eat and sleep at odd times. Nighttime shift work has been linked to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. Studies have linked poor melatonin activity and disrupted sleep-wake cycles with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's, cancer, autoimmune flare-ups, obesity, and more. Make breakfast your largest meal and make dinner your smallest. While this may prove difficult for those with a busy social life or family that sits down to a big dinner every evening, make the evening meal smaller whenever possible. Prioritize protein and healthy fats with breakfast, and minimize sugar and caffeine intake especially before lunch, to stabilize blood sugar and regulate metabolism. Avoid between-meal snacks and bedtime goodies. Try time-restricted eating pattern, or intermittent fasting, to maximize weight management. Instead, have your dinners earlier and make them relatively light. The take-home message here is like the old proverb, \"Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper.\" However, a new study on how the time of day affects autoimmune symptoms could offer new ways of treating this complex and increasingly common group of diseases. According to new research, there may be ties to the body’s internal clocks that have a huge impact on severity of both symptoms and the disease itself. Our immune system bases its activity partially on our internal clocks, so it is no surprise that autoimmune diseases do so as well. Could Molecular Clocks Contribute to Autoimmune Disease? This is not the first study to find that internal clocks are linked to both risk and severity of autoimmune disease. In fact, there is a new field called chronoimmunology dedicated to the study of how immune systems affect and are affected by timing and clocks. Previous studies have found that young adults who work odd shifts, for example, have a higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease later in life. In balanced amounts, our clocks maintain balanced immune activity. Maintain a stable schedule, including keeping roughly the same eating, waking and sleeping times every day. Get ample amounts of natural light exposure during the day but limit lights—especially from screens—during the night. Prepare for changes in your daily schedule, such as daylight savings time or travel, by slowly changing your routine to the new one. Consider taking a melatonin supplement if sleep remains elusive. In addition, maintaining a healthy and well-regulated circadian rhythm is important to your health in a variety of other ways. Keeping your circadian rhythm steady and ticking along is one of the best ways to encourage whole body health and wellness.

A new global guideline on chronic urticaria (CU) recommends Xolair® (omalizumab), indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), for patients who are not responding to antihistamines,. Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate. Xolair is the only biologic shown to be effective in CSU.\" Patients treated with Xolair for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements in quality of life by 78% (vs placebo 44%, p<0.0001) as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In addition, data show that almost 90% of CSU patients who responded well to initial Xolair treatment regained symptom control within 12 weeks of Xolair retreatment following a treatment interruption, based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) criteria (UAS7<=6). Also, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma. Xolair is a targeted therapy that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). In allergic diseases and asthma, the binding of IgE by Xolair reduces symptoms by suppressing multiple cell activation mechanisms, including some that result in histamine release. Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanism of action of Xolair in CSU, which could lead to a deeper understanding of how the disease develops. Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005 and has over 800,000 patient years of exposure. In the US, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Novartis is a global leader in Immunology & Dermatology. Other key brands include Xolair® (omalizumab) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), Zortress®/Certican® (everolimus) and Myfortic® (mycophenolic acid) in transplant and Ilaris® (canakinumab), approved to treat several rare diseases including some Periodic Fever Syndromes.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Urticaria and Angioedema: A Worldwide Perspective. Unmet clinical needs in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Allergy 2011;66:317-330. A drug already used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma appears to offer relief to people with chronic hives who haven't been helped by standard medications, new research suggests. The prescription drug -- omalizumab (Xolair) -- is already available to treat hives, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year for that use. \"And until now antihistamines have been the only approved drug for chronic hives. But to work, antihistamines often need to be used at up to four times approved levels, which has a sedating effect. So then we would turn to the heavy artillery, like [the immunosuppressant drug] cyclosporine, which also has very severe side effects, and can't be taken by people with high blood pressure or heart disease.\" \"All this means that many, many patients have simply been left without any treatment,\" she noted. \"But with this drug we are seeing great improvement in patients who previously had no options. The current study is the latest in a series of ongoing studies, which are being funded by drug manufacturer Genentech Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG in Basel Switzerland. The team found that by the 12th week, people given Xolair showed a marked reduction in their overall number of hives, hive intensity and itching severity, compared with patients who got the dummy treatment. Symptom relief was maintained through the six-month mark, and the authors determined that those treated with the highest (300 mg) dosage of Xolair saw the biggest improvement. Xolair is the First Biologic Medicine Approved for CIU, a Burdensome Skin Condition that Can Cause Hives and Severe Itch and May Last Many Years. Nearly 50 Percent of Patients Have Inadequate Response to H1-antihistamines, Previously the Only Approved Therapy for CIU3. Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. The new use is for people 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines. Xolair is approved for people 12 years and older with CIU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Xolair is not used to treat other forms of urticaria (hives) and is not for use in children less than 12 years of age. It is jointly developed by Genentech and Novartis Pharma AG and is co-promoted in the U.S. with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The efficacy and safety profile of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was evaluated in two clinical studies called ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II(5) . In these studies, patients 12 to 75 years old received doses of Xolair at 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo(5) . Xolair or placebo was given every four weeks for 24 weeks (ASTERIA I) and 12 weeks (ASTERIA II). In addition, patients continued to receive H(1) -antihistamine medicines they had been taking for CIU before starting treatment with Xolair(5) . The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) . Also, a larger proportion of patients (36 percent) treated with Xolair 300 mg reported no itch and no hives at Week 12, compared to patients treated with Xolair 150 mg (15 percent), and patients in the placebo group (9 percent)(5) . The most common side effects in patients treated with Xolair were nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection(5) . moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma who have had a skin or blood test that is positive for allergic asthma and whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1-antihistamine treatment. Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria (hives), acute bronchospasm (serious and sudden breathing problems) or status asthmaticus (acute, severe, prolonged asthma attack that can be life threatening).

O'Rourke's performance in the 2018 Senate race has shaken the notion of Republican dominance in Texas, with analysts predicting greater gains for the Democrats going into the 2020s. On November 6, 2018, El Paso County elected a new member of the House of Representatives of the United States, a new county judge, two county commissioners, five state representatives, four city council members. There are several open races, as the incumbent member of Congress, Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, unsuccessfully ran for the Senate against \n\n of minorities—that is what this is about, as well.\" Doggett was set to face State Representative Joaquin Castro in the 35th district primary election. The race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro seen as a \"rising star\" \n\n while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. On July 31, 2012, she became the first person in Texas history to defeat an incumbent Republican senator, Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio, in a primary election.

While multiple pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions exist, careful selection of therapy is paramount as some medications can exacerbate seizures. With the recent approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome, providers and patients have an additional therapeutic option to consider. Within this context, pharmacists have a vital role in educating providers, caregivers, and patients on medication therapy. Cannabis has been used for over 4,000 years with varied success to treat ailments including chronic pain, eating disorders, rheumatism, and convulsions. In the 19th century, neurologists noted the potential effectiveness of cannabis for treating seizure disorders.34 Research since has continued to evaluate cannabis as a treatment option for epilepsy. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found significant improvement of seizure control when patients were treated with CBD in addition to their standard epilepsy treatment. Children and adults with DS and refractory seizures receiving CBD (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks exhibited a 52% reduction in seizure frequency compared to a modest 5% reduction with placebo (P = .01).38 In fact, 5% of these patients in the treatment group were seizure-free (P = .08).38 Similarly, in another study, addition of CBD (20 mg/kg) in patients with LGS and other refractory seizures resulted in a 43.9% median reduction of drop seizures in comparison with a 21.8% reduction with placebo addition.39 A third trial evaluating CBD in patients on standard epilepsy treatment showed 41.9% and 37.2% reduction in drop seizure frequencies over a 14-week treatment period with doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg twice a day, respectively, compared with 17.2% in the placebo group. In these studies, adverse effects noted included decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and abnormal liver-function tests.38-40 Drug interactions that may require monitoring and dose adjustment included valproic acid and clobazam.38-40 These results highlight the potential of cannabidiol as an adjunctive treatment for DS, LGS, and other refractory seizures. Patients with refractory seizures such as DS and LGS are at an increased risk for medication errors for reasons including complex medication regimens and increased transitions of care.43 As pharmacotherapy experts, pharmacists can play a major role in ensuring safe and effective therapy for patients by educating providers on appropriate medication choices and doses; evaluating patients’ medication regimen for contraindications, drug interactions, and adverse effects; ensuring that medication reconciliation is conducted carefully; and accurately providing education and counseling on medication therapy to patients and family members.

Some of these adults and parents, as well as medical researchers and physicians, are finding new hope in the use of cannabidiol, or CBD, for reducing the frequency and severity of seizures. CBD is a cannabinoid molecule produced by cannabis. Unlike THC, which is the most common cannabinoid, CBD is non-intoxicating. It also has significant pain relief, anti-inflammatory, and anti-anxiety properties, which offer a wide range of possible medicinal applications. CBD is usually administered orally in oil form to control seizures and can be given as drops under the tongue or mixed with food. Medical cannabis, a type of marijuana that contains both THC and CBD, has been used successfully to control seizures. Several states have approved the use of medical marijuana for epilepsy, but research is showing that CBD may be more effective than THC at reducing seizure activity. Some types of medical marijuana are low-THC and high-CBD, meaning that they have less of the intoxicating component that causes a “high” and more potentially beneficial CBD. More research is needed to understand exactly how CBD affects the brain, but researchers believe that CBD may control seizures by calming the brain’s abnormal electrical activity and chemical processes. Animal studies have shown that CBD has an anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effect, which means that it shows promise as a preventative treatment for epilepsy in humans. Although research into the possible applications of CBD for epilepsy treatment is encouraging and ongoing, some parents of children who have epilepsy are not waiting for further research results. Many parents with children who have severe, uncontrolled epilepsy are giving their children CBD now — and some are reporting life-changing results. Scientific researchers have conducted several controlled studies on CBD, meaning that study participants were divided into two or more groups for comparison. One group received a placebo (or a harmless substance that has no therapeutic effect), and the other group received the medication. An open-label study of an oral CBD solution found that of the median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 35.6 percent during the 12-week study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 14-week trial of 120 children with Dravet syndrome showed that, on average, the frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from 12.4 per month to 5.9 per month after CBD treatment. Five percent of patients became seizure-free after using CBD, while none became seizure-free after using the placebo. The first trial, which included 171 patients, found that patients treated with CBD experienced a 44-percent average reduction of drop seizures. The second trial divided participants into two different dosage groups for CBD, as well as one placebo group. The study found that both of the CBD groups experienced a significant reduction in the average monthly frequency of drop seizures. In a survey conducted in Mexico on 43 children with epilepsy, 81.3 percent of parents whose children used CBD reported a decrease in convulsions. Not only are parents reporting a reduction in their children’s seizures after CBD therapy, but they also are reporting a better quality of life, including improved social interactions, memory, behavior, and energy. Another survey of the parents of 19 children who were using CBD-enriched cannabis, 16 parents (84 percent) reported a reduction in their child’s seizure frequency. As research into CBD for epilepsy treatment continues, studies will look at exactly how CBD impacts the brain. Researchers also will try to determine effective dosing and strength guidelines for epilepsy treatment using CBD and will look at whether CBD interacts with other anti-seizure medications. But, for people with uncontrolled epilepsy who are out of treatment options, CBD may offer a way to control seizures — as well as a chance at an improved quality of life. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox–Gastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide. One yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a drug called Epidiolex which contains cannabidiol (CBD). The preparation in form of strawberry syrup will be used in the treatment of patients with epileptic syndromes (dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) between 2 years old and older. “This is an important advancement in the treatment of children’s epilepsy,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Scott Gottlieb on Monday. “Due to the efficacy and safety of the use of Epidiolex confirmed in clinical trials in patients, an official agreement was finally approved on the possibility of using this drug in the treatment of certain types of epilepsy,” adds Gottlieb. On the website of the producer, a biopharmaceutical company GW Pharmaceuticals dealing with the discovery, development, and commercialization of new drugs, Epidiolex is the first (available by medical prescription) pharmaceutical formulation containing a high content of purified cannabidiol (CBD) of plant origin that does not cause intoxicating. “The approval of Epidiolex is a milestone in the use of a cannabidiol for the treatment of neurological disorders. This is the first and so far the only CBD drug that can be used to treat two types of epilepsy in children. We would like to say that we have high hopes for the introduction of Epidiolex for medical treatment, “ said Justin Gover, CEO of GW. “The FDA approval of our drug is the culmination of the long-term cooperation of GW Pharmaceuticals with patients, their families, and doctors to develop a new preparation that would be helpful in the fight against epilepsy. Patients deserve it and soon will have access to a CBD-containing drug that has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials, meets all the pharmaceutical product quality criteria and will be available as a prescription from a doctor “ – Justin Gover. “In my medical practice, I had many patients who suffered from drug-resistant epilepsy. In such patients, the treatment regimens used so far most often did not bring the expected results, which is why these patients often asked about the possibility of using CBD “ – said Dr. Orrin Devinsky of the Epileptic Treatment Center at NYU Langone Health, and also one of the main clinical trial managers of Epidiolex. Elizabeth Thiele, director of the pediatric clinic at the General Hospital in Massachusetts, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief scientist in clinical trials with the drug Epidiolex mentions that the Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet teams are two of the most difficult to control forms of pediatric epilepsy. “These children and their families face a long and difficult path, and very few achieve adequate seizure control. This drug supplements a specific pharmacological gap dedicated to a specific population of pediatric patients and is now the first that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The clinical trial program for Epidiolex included three randomized, double-blind clinical trials and an open-label extension study. From articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet scientific journals, it appears that the addition of Epidiolex to other anti-epileptic therapies has resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet. In 2015, GW Pharmaceutical initiated Phase 3 clinical trials of cannabidiol oral solution for treatment of two rare disease in children – Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. In August 2015, GW received FDA Fast Track Development Program designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the drug candidate to treat newborns with epilepsy. The drug, under the brand name Epidiolex, was given US Food and Drug Administration approval in June 2018. It was subsequently given European EMA approval in September 2019 under the brand name Epidyolex.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

He was criticized for quarantining Indonesians returning from Wuhan too close to residential areas, despite assurance from Indonesian government that the returning Indonesians were not infected. After a mandatory 14-days period of quarantine, all Indonesians quarantined were declared infection-free. Terawan was criticized for stating that flu is more dangerous than COVID-19 because flu has a higher mortality rate. Terawan is also under fire for his \"anti-science\" and \"arrogant\" attitude in leading the COVID-19 crisis in Indonesia. One of the cases is when he challenged a study done by Harvard University.

In December 2020, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said illegal immigration was behind a new wave of COVID-19 infection in the country. That same day, the Ministry of Health confirmed that two COVID-19 positive mariners were self isolating on a vessel off the coast of Taranaki. ; Singapore has reported ten new cases including two locally transmitted and eight imported, bringing the total to 62,640. Of the locally transmitted cases, one of them is unlinked, and one resides in a dormitory. The COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). The first imported case in Cambodia was detected in Sihanoukville on 27 January 2020. Although a number of imported cases and transmission to direct contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no community transmission was detected until 29 November 2020. As of July 2021, Phnom Penh has been the most affected province with the majority of infections and deaths. Banteay Meanchey has the second-highest number of infections, whereas Kandal has second-highest number of deaths. The public health response is led by the Ministry of Health with support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. In November, some restrictions were reinstated in Phnom Penh and thousands of Cambodian government employees and contacts went into quarantine following a one day-visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in Bangkok. On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected. The country began its vaccination programme and detected its largest outbreak to date in February 2021 thought to be related to a Phnom Penh quarantine breach that led to outbreaks at nightlife venues. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Cambodia's response up to July 2020 and its welcoming of the MS Westerdam were praised by the World Health Organization. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine. The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns. No officials or passengers implemented social distancing or mask wearing during the ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around Phnom Penh. Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected. By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize. 1-15 March 2020 - imported cases\nOn 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap. He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi. Meanwhile, some 40 other people in the same city had been isolated under medical supervision since indirect contacts with the same Japanese man. At 4:30p.m., a 65-year-old British woman had tested positive for the virus in Kampong Cham. Arriving to Phnom Penh on 7 March via the cruise, it was reported that a Vietnamese woman, who was seated next to the group on the plane from London, had carried the virus. Two of them refused, claiming that they were healthy and having no symptoms, until the cruise ship reached Kampong Cham on 9 March. Following the event, the boat had been docked to provide samples to be tested from all 29 other passengers and 34 crew and were they placed under quarantine in a hotel somewhere in the city. The British patient was transferred to Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in Phnom Penh at her own request, adding that she had been conducted with coordination from WHO. Due to their ages, the married couple were transferred to Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh. On 13 March, health officials confirmed two cases in Phnom Penh at 8p.m. A 49-year-old Canadian and a 33-year-old Belgian were in quarantine in Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital. For the time being, another two visitors to Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (A British and his friend, a Canadian woman who worked in China) were suspected to have the symptoms and admitted to the said hospital. The British man, however, made an escape but was found later in Kampot and hospitalized there. According to  a Ministry of Health press release, Cambodia announced a ban on all entries from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the United States, thereby all visas would be undeniably suspended. On 15 March, an additional case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Phnom Penh at 5p.m. To wait for the results, he wasn't allowed to go any further, however as a follow-up health checkup was presented, he was informed that he could carry on and the results would be available accordingly. It included a 4-month-old child of the French patient, a Cambodian from France, and two Khmer Muslims, 35 and 39, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat mosque superspreader event near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 29 February. The ten mosque event attendees arrived at Preah Vihear (except one, who arrived at Stung Treng) on 3 March and up to 14 March, Malaysia informed that it had found the infected from that gathering. Within the span of two days on 17 March, the total confirmed cases leapt to 33. 11 Khmer were found to be infected in various provinces. One case further referred to a Cambodian man who crossed the border from Thailand in Banteay Meanchey. At 9:00p.m., nine more cases were included, six more attendees in Malaysia and three Malaysians out of a group of five. Two of the group were put under quarantine at a mosque in Kep. On 18 March, four more cases were detected: two Malaysians in Kampot and two more tabligh attendees in Tboung Khmum. On 19 March, ten more cases were detected: two wives of the infected men, two more tabligh attendees, and six Malaysians. On 20 March, the Ministry of Health announced an additional 4 confirmed cases: a Malaysian, and three Cambodians, one of whom was infected from an attendee from Malaysia and had no recent travel record overseas. On 21 March, two more cases were confirmed at 9p.m., a 67-year-old and an 80-year-old Frenchmen who arrived Sihanoukville as tourists on 18 March. 37 people suspected to have contacts with were put under quarantine. At 10p.m., more 29 people linked in the same tourist group of the cases confirmed the previous night, plus two Cambodian guides were detected of the virus. The tourist group arrived Cambodia on 11 March, visiting four provinces. On 23 March at 19:30, three new cases were recorded to include a mother of a 4-month-old child whom she and her infant had been placed under treatment at the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital and other two Cambodians. It also added that four patients, two from Tboung Khmum and another two from Battambang, were all tested negative twice and ready to be discharged. On 25 March, Cambodia recorded five new cases, two from the French tourist group and 3 Cambodians with no recent foreign travels. Four more patients, three from Phnom Penh and one from Tboung Khmum, had made complete recovery for that day. 174 Chinese nationals had been quarantined in Svay Rieng upon their arrival from Phnom Penh by bus after two of them exhibited high temperatures. The local authorities were ordered to pay close attention and getting them informed on preventive measures and self-quarantine themselves for two weeks. On 26–28 March, two Indonesians taking off from Thailand and a Cambodian family of four who went on a trip to France were added to confirmed cases. On 29–31 March, six cases were added to the total of 109 at the month's end. Eleven patients from Koh Kong, Banteay Meanchey, Phnom Penh, Kampong Chhnang, Battambang and Siem Reap was  reported to have recovered from the disease. The authorities had traced 340 people who had indirect contacts with infected French tourist group in Siem Reap. April 2020 - cancellation of Khmer New Year\nBetween 1 and 9 April, Cambodia counted 9 new cases, most notably on 9 April, a discharged patient was found to be relapsing two days after. Moreover, 48 patients reportedly had recovered, mostly in Sihanoukville, adding up to 68 in total. A planned return of 150 Cambodian workers from Malaysia was turn down on 7 April by the government to tighten safety for its country. May–October 2020 - slowdown in new case detections and reopenings\nAfter a month-long streak of no new cases in May, the Ministry of Health reported a new imported case of a man travelling from the Philippines. The other 62 passengers on the flight are quarantined at a hotel in Phnom Penh. Szijjártó tested positive upon his return to Bangkok the following day, prompting staff from 13 government institutions, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, to go into quarantine. As of 11 November, the Ministry of Health had tested over 1,000 contacts and had started contact tracing efforts into seven provinces, with four contacts testing positive. First local transmission\nOn 29 November, Cambodia reported its first known local community transmission on a woman in Phnom Penh with no history of overseas travel. The cluster was traced back to the daughter of the prison director, who showed symptoms in October, and may have had contact with an imported case. With a budget of $170 million, Cambodia thus began its vaccination programme on February 10. A large-scale outbreak detected in Phnom Penh in 20 February took place when two out of four Chinese nationals who breached quarantine at the Sokha Hotel a few days prior tested positive. An investigation by Al Jazeera English indicated after the quarantined persons had bribed security guards to be released, Phnom Penh's casino sector and human trafficking may have contributed to the outbreak. Later patients would be sent to Phnom Penh Quarantine Center in Prek Pnov District. On March 11, a Cambodian man, 50, died at 10:40 a.m. from chronic lung disease in Phnom Penh. In April 2021, a mass vaccination of Cambodia's textile workers began, with the view to help jump-start the country's post-pandemic economic recovery; the textile industry is worth an estimated $7 billion to Cambodia's economy. 544 of these were in Phnom Penh, mostly associated with cluster outbreaks at O'Russei market and a garment factory in Meanchey district. April–August 2021: city-wide lockdowns \nOn 6 April, home treatment for patients showing mild or no symptoms were introduced in Phnom Penh. The Interior Ministry announced in June that 10-20% of prisoners in certain prisons, representing several thousand people, had been infected by COVID-19. By June 16, It is reported that 3,076,775 people (1,494,797 females) have been vaccinated in Cambodia. Provinces that border Thailand (Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, Battambang, Pailin, Pursat, Koh Kong, Preah Vihear) and Siem Reap were put into lockdown for 14 days to combat Delta variant transmission in community, starting from 29 July. Most were reported on migrants crossing from Thailand. A vaccination programme for 2 million people aged 12–17 would be run on 1 August, first in Phnom Penh, then Kandal, Sihanoukville and Koh Kong. On 1 August, MoH confirmed 109 new cases of Delta variant which 5 cases were detected in Phnom Penh. November 2021-present full reopening \nOn November 1, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that the country would be fully reopening all sectors, saying that the country had achieved herd immunity by vaccinating majority of its entire population. To expedite the reopening effort and promote tourism recovery, Hun Sen also ordered a removal of quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated travelers entering Cambodia by land, air or water, whether Cambodians or foreigners starting from November 15. Around 86,000 Cambodian migrant workers returned from Thailand as border closures took effect, with minimal employment opportunities upon their return. The pandemic severely impacted the tourism sector in Cambodia as international travel was disrupted by restrictions and all tourist visas were suspended. The coastal tourism hub of Sihanoukville was impacted by a drop in arrivals from China. In Siem Reap, ticket sales for Angkor National Park dropped to an average of 22 people per day during April, leaving Angkor Wat, typically bustling with thousands of tourists, almost empty. Humanitarian assistance \n\nOn 23 March 2020, a team of seven specialist physicians from southern China's Guangxi with medical supplies, including ventilators, medical masks, protective suits, test kits, and infrared temperature sensors, had landed in Phnom Penh to assist tackling the pandemic. On 21 May 2021, Cambodia received 528 packs of Cycloferon tablets and 520 packs of Cycloferon ampoules providing from Russia. Cambodia had donated millions of face masks and PPE to Laos, Myanmar, East Timor and Nepal. Through the Vaccine Maitri initiative, Cambodia would receive 1 million Covishield vaccine doses from India in March 2021. United Kingdom announced 415,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine donation to Cambodia, expecting to arrive in August 2021. Reception\n\nInitial response \nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, it was reported that Prime Minister Hun Sen was downplaying the pandemic and Cambodia was not responding in an effort to maintain its close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. In February, Hun Sen downplayed the risk of the virus at a press conference, suggesting the virus was sensationalized by the media and threatened to expel those present who were wearing masks. Unlike most other countries, Cambodia did not cease travel to and from China and did not evacuate its overseas citizens from Wuhan during the initial outbreak there. During a press conference on 27 July 2020, at the six month mark of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom praised Cambodia for its success in \"preventing [a] large scale outbreak\", along with New Zealand, Rwanda, Vietnam and Thailand. The WHO also praised Cambodia's welcoming of the MS Westerdam. Testing procedures \nConcerns have been raised about the lack of widespread community testing in Cambodia. A number of people travelling from Cambodia have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in other countries. Prisons \nNo prisoners were tested for COVID-19 despite coming into contact with officials who tested positive, prompting criticism from the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, particularly as Cambodia's prisons are often overcrowded. Prisons director Nuth Savna told VOD in December that several prisoners had fever but still did not test them, dismissing this as due to the change in weather. In June 2021, the Interior Ministry's Prisons Department admitted that 10-20% of prison inmates in certain prisons had been infected with COVID-19, indicating several thousand infections were initially not tested or reported. In April 2021, Phnom Penh police were criticised by Cambodian human rights groups and Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith for implementing caning to punish violators of the city's lockdown restrictions.

Reception\n\nInitial response \nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, it was reported that Prime Minister Hun Sen was downplaying the pandemic and Cambodia was not responding in an effort to maintain its close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. In February, Hun Sen downplayed the risk of the virus at a press conference, suggesting the virus was sensationalized by the media and threatened to expel those present who were wearing masks. Unlike most other countries, Cambodia did not cease travel to and from China and did not evacuate its overseas citizens from Wuhan during the initial outbreak there. During a press conference on 27 July 2020, at the six month mark of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom praised Cambodia for its success in \"preventing [a] large scale outbreak\", along with New Zealand, Rwanda, Vietnam and Thailand. The WHO also praised Cambodia's welcoming of the MS Westerdam. Testing procedures \nConcerns have been raised about the lack of widespread community testing in Cambodia. A number of people travelling from Cambodia have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in other countries. Prisons \nNo prisoners were tested for COVID-19 despite coming into contact with officials who tested positive, prompting criticism from the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, particularly as Cambodia's prisons are often overcrowded. Prisons director Nuth Savna told VOD in December that several prisoners had fever but still did not test them, dismissing this as due to the change in weather. In June 2021, the Interior Ministry's Prisons Department admitted that 10-20% of prison inmates in certain prisons had been infected with COVID-19, indicating several thousand infections were initially not tested or reported. In April 2021, Phnom Penh police were criticised by Cambodian human rights groups and Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith for implementing caning to punish violators of the city's lockdown restrictions.

The first imported case in Cambodia was detected in Sihanoukville on 27 January 2020. Although a number of imported cases and transmission to direct contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no community transmission was detected until 29 November 2020. As of July 2021, Phnom Penh has been the most affected province with the majority of infections and deaths. Banteay Meanchey has the second-highest number of infections, whereas Kandal has second-highest number of deaths. The public health response is led by the Ministry of Health with support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. Cambodia's initial response was slow - during the initial outbreak in China, few international travel restrictions were introduced, Cambodian citizens were not evacuated from Wuhan and Prime Minister Hun Sen downplayed the threat. In November, some restrictions were reinstated in Phnom Penh and thousands of Cambodian government employees and contacts went into quarantine following a one day-visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in Bangkok. On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected. The country began its vaccination programme and detected its largest outbreak to date in February 2021 thought to be related to a Phnom Penh quarantine breach that led to outbreaks at nightlife venues. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Cambodia's response up to July 2020 and its welcoming of the MS Westerdam were praised by the World Health Organization. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine. The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns. No officials or passengers implemented social distancing or mask wearing during the ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around Phnom Penh. Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected. By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize. 1-15 March 2020 - imported cases\nOn 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap. He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi.

Two of them refused, claiming that they were healthy and having no symptoms, until the cruise ship reached Kampong Cham on 9 March. Following the event, the boat had been docked to provide samples to be tested from all 29 other passengers and 34 crew and were they placed under quarantine in a hotel somewhere in the city. The British patient was transferred to Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in Phnom Penh at her own request, adding that she had been conducted with coordination from WHO. Due to their ages, the married couple were transferred to Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh. On 13 March, health officials confirmed two cases in Phnom Penh at 8p.m. A 49-year-old Canadian and a 33-year-old Belgian were in quarantine in Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital. For the time being, another two visitors to Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (A British and his friend, a Canadian woman who worked in China) were suspected to have the symptoms and admitted to the said hospital.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and a pandemic on March 11. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them.

In the only election debate he attended, where he joined Democrat James Thompson, and the campaign manager for Libertarian candidate Chris Rockhold, he repeated the claim that Planned Parenthood had been profiting by selling parts of aborted fetuses. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.The episode has cast a chill on fetal tissue research in the United States.One institution posted a guard outside a lab where the research was being conducted.Fetal tissue has become harder for scientists to procure.In other countries, the research proceeds apace. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. The recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The SHERLOC study enrolled 109 patients with NSCLC. Objective response rate (ORR), time to progression and overall survival were key secondary endpoints. The patients need to have progressed after one or two lines of prior systemic therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease and have received previous CDK inhibitor-based therapy. Key secondary endpoints are objective response rate, time to progression and overall survival. The data were presented today at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. NLG2101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of indoximod 1200 mg orally, twice daily in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly in patients with metastatic ER/PR positive or negative, HER2 negative breast cancer. The trial, which reached its goal of 154 patients enrolled across multiple sites in the United States and Europe, is designed to evaluate the combination of indoximod and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study's primary endpoint is progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival, response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria, safety, and immune response correlative assays. Preliminary evaluable safety data from 128 patients, when considered in a blinded fashion pooling control and treatments arms of the study, suggests that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Additionally, no unexpected safety signals were reported with the combination of indoximod with docetaxel or paclitaxel, suggesting that there is no additional or unique toxicity with the addition of indoximod to chemotherapy. Objective responses were achieved in an earlier Phase 1 trial combining indoximod and docetaxel in patients with metastatic solid tumors, including breast tumors. \"I believe this is an exciting chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said Shou-Ching Tang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Leader, Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Team at Augusta University. The data, presented during the poster session \"Treatment: Immunotherapy,\" correspond to the abstract (P2-11-09) entitled, \"A phase 2 randomized trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod in combination with taxane based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: preliminary data.\" Indoximod is an orally available small molecule that has shown the potential to interfere with multiple targets within the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway. AMES, Iowa, April 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ: NLNK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing cancer therapeutics, today announced the initiation of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of its first IDO (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitor, indoximod, in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Phase 2 clinical study will evaluate indoximod as a new approach to treating cancer by administering this novel IDO pathway inhibitor, designed to counteract a key mechanism by which tumors evade immune-mediated destruction, in combination with a conventional cytotoxin, docetaxel. Indoximod is the most advanced product candidate to enter clinical trials based on NewLink's proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor platform for small-molecule, orally bioavailable cancer immunotherapies. \"There is significant unmet need for new approaches that may offer more effective treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women in the United States,\" said Hatem Soliman, MD, a medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer in The Center for Women's Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for this study. \"Indoximod, an IDO pathway inhibitor is an immune check point inhibitor akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of indoximod in combination with docetaxel as compared to docetaxel alone in up to 120 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Study endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, median overall survival and evaluation of pharmacodynamic tumor markers, in addition to safety. For more information about the study please refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Mechanism of action: Indoximod (1-methyl-d-tryptophan) is a small molecule, methylated tryptophan, anti-immunosuppressive-toleragenic, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitor. A new director for the National Cancer Institute, an early release of data in prostate cancer, disappointing findings in a renal cell carcinoma trial, enrollment paused in 2 multiple myeloma studies, and discontinuation of a phase III colorectal cancer trial. This new protocol revises the planned analyses of the primary and several secondary endpoints, reducing the target patient population to 1440 patients, down from 1560. The FDA approved enzalutamide in 2012 as a treatment for men with late-stage CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. In 2014, the agency approved the drug for first-line therapy based on results from the phase III PREVAIL trial, in which enzalutamide improved OS by 29% and radiographic progression-free survival by 81% compared with placebo. The FDA expanded enzalutamide’s label again in 2016 based on findings from the phase II TERRAIN trial, in which enzalutamide reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 40% versus bicalutamide, and improved median rPFS by 6.1 months in patients with metastatic CRPC. In renal cell carcinoma, the combination of dalantercept plus axitinib failed to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced disease compared with placebo. Frequency of grade 3 or higher adverse events, regardless of causality, were similar between the 2 groups. An external Data Monitoring Committee recommended halting new enrollment while the company collects more data to better understand reported deaths in the pembrolizumab arms. This decision strictly affects KEYNOTE-183 and KEYNOTE-185 and no other pembrolizumab studies. KEYNOTE-183 is comparing the combination of pembrolizumab, pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have undergone at least 2 lines of prior treatment. KEYNOTE-185 is comparing pembrolizumab, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Finally, the phase III XCITE study of MABp1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer has been cancelled by its manufacturer XBiotech after a second prospectively planned, unblinded analysis. In its statement announcing the decision, XBiotech said its independent data monitoring committee determined that data were not sufficient to meet efficacy or the threshold for continuation. Results from XCITE were presented at the 2016 World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer, but even at that time, healthcare professionals questioned the data. The unsuccessful results of these clinical trials prompted CancerVax to say it would cut payroll by more than half to roughly 80 employees from 183. Out of 88 participants who had never undergone treatment with an approved drug, 73% experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 61% of them.

The second American woman to ever be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, Yalow is best known for having co-developed a diagnostic technique, known as a radioimmunoassay, for measuring tiny quantities of various biological samples in blood and other bodily fluids. The test's primary detection mechanism is an antibody combined with a radioisotope. First devised for determining insulin levels in diabetes patients, the technique is now used for hundreds of other substances previously difficult to detect because they were too small. YouYou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with William Campbell and Satoshi Omura. A general representation of the method used to produce monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes. Given almost any substance, it is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to that substance; they can then serve to detect or purify that substance. This has become an important tool in biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. The idea of \"magic bullets\" was first proposed by Paul Ehrlich, who, at the beginning of the 20th century, postulated that, if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. He and Élie Metchnikoff received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this work, which led to an effective syphilis treatment by 1910. While working at the Institute of Experimental Therapy, Ehrlich formed an idea that it could be possible to kill specific microbes that cause diseases without harming the body itself. He named the hypothetical agent as Zauberkugel, the magic bullet. He envisioned that just like a bullet fired from a gun to hit a specific target, there could be a way to specifically target invading microbes. His continued research to discover the magic bullet resulted in further knowledge of the functions of the body's immune system, and in the development of Salvarsan, the first effective drug for syphilis, in 1909. His works were the foundation of immunology, and for his contributions he shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Élie Metchnikoff. He invented the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. In immunology, antigens (Ag) are structures specifically bound by antibodies (Ab) or a cell surface version of Ab ~ B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The term antigen originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody only in the form of native antigen. It was expanded later to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment after processing the native antigen that can be recognized by T-cell receptor (TCR). César Milstein, CH, FRS was an Argentinian biochemist in the field of antibody research. Milstein shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 with Niels Kaj Jerne and Georges J. F. Köhler. In 1988, Greg Winter and his team pioneered the techniques to humanize monoclonal antibodies,  eliminating the reactions that many monoclonal antibodies caused in some patients. Sir Gregory Paul Winter is a Nobel Prize-winning British biochemist best known for his work on the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies. His research career has been based almost entirely at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, in Cambridge, England. He is credited with invented techniques to both humanise (1986) and, later, to fully humanise using phage display, antibodies for therapeutic uses. Previously, antibodies had been derived from mice, which made them difficult to use in human therapeutics because the human immune system had anti-mouse reactions to them. For these developments Winter was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with George Smith and Frances Arnold. [ citation needed ] Rabbit B-cells can be used to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes,  but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. The most productive and stable clone is then selected for future use. One of the advantages of the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals in the laboratory. In contrast, the in vivo sample is likely to have host antibodies, proteases, nucleases, nucleic acids and viruses. The sample is first conditioned, or prepared for purification. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially in cases where the desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge, and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation. However, this method may be problematic for antibodies that are easily damaged, as harsh conditions are generally used. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin. To achieve maximum purity in a single step, affinity purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an agarose support. Recombinant antibody engineering involves antibody production by the use of viruses or yeast, rather than mice. These techniques rely on rapid cloning of immunoglobulin gene segments to create libraries of antibodies with slightly different amino acid sequences from which antibodies with desired specificities can be selected. Ever since the discovery that monoclonal antibodies could be generated, scientists have targeted the creation of fully human products to reduce the side effects of humanised or chimeric antibodies. Two successful approaches have been identified: transgenic mice  and phage display. As of November 2016, thirteen of the nineteen fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics on the market were derived from transgenic mice technology. Monoclonal antibodies have been approved to treat cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases, macular degeneration, transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis and viral infection. Once monoclonal antibodies for a given substance have been produced, they can be used to detect the presence of this substance. ADEPT, antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy; ADCC: antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; CDC: complement-dependent cytotoxicity; MAb: monoclonal antibody; scFv, single-chain Fv fragment. For a more comprehensive list, see List of monoclonal antibodies. Below are examples of clinically important monoclonal antibodies. This process starts by injecting a mouse with an antigen that provokes an immune response. In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest is inserted into a phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to \"display\" the protein on its outside while containing the gene for the protein on its inside, resulting in a connection between genotype and phenotype. In this way, large libraries of proteins can be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection, which is analogous to natural selection. It is a type of chromatographic laboratory technique used for purifying biological molecules within a mixture by exploiting molecular properties. Epitope mapping is the process of experimentally identifying the binding site, or \"epitope\", of an antibody on its target antigen. Epitope characterization can also help elucidate the mechanism of binding for an antibody and can strength intellectual property (patent) protection. Experimental epitope mapping data can be incorporated into robust algorithms to facilitate in silico prediction of B-cell epitopes based on sequence and/or structural data. Like a whole antibody, it is able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a molecular weight of only 12–15 kDa, single-domain antibodies are much smaller than common antibodies which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and even smaller than Fab fragments and single-chain variable fragments. The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), also referred to as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It has found use in biochemical research because of its ability to bind immunoglobulins. Each domain is able to bind proteins from many mammalian species, most notably IgGs. Through these interactions in serum, where IgG molecules are bound in the wrong orientation, the bacteria disrupts opsonization and phagocytosis. The objective is that this treatment will stimulate the patient's immune system to attack those cells. A bispecific monoclonal antibody is an artificial protein that can simultaneously bind to two different types of antigen. Synthetic antibodies include recombinant antibodies, nucleic acid aptamers and non-immunoglobulin protein scaffolds. As a consequence of their in vitro manufacturing method the antigen recognition site of synthetic antibodies can be engineered to any desired target and may extend beyond the typical immune repertoire offered by natural antibodies. The most commonly used form is the single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has shown the most promising traits exploitable in human medicine and research. ↑ \"Cytochrome P450 Mediated Drug and Carcinogen Metabolism using Monoclonal Antibodies\". ↑ Gelboin, Harry V; Krausz, Kristopher W; Gonzalez, Frank J; Yang, Tian J (1999-11-01). \"Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies to human cytochrome P450 enzymes: a new avenue for drug discovery\".

First and foremost, it ensures equal access to education for all students, regardless of their mental health condition. Accommodations such as extended time for exams, modified attendance policies, or flexibility in assignment deadlines can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by students with mental illness. Moreover, academic accommodations can contribute to the overall mental well-being of students with mental illness. Importantly, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness is not just a matter of fairness, but also a legal obligation. The American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and its 2008 amendments mandate that students with psychiatric disabilities be provided with reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. By complying with these legal requirements, postsecondary institutions can prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for students with mental illness. In summary, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant because it ensures equal access to education, supports mental well-being, improves academic performance, and fulfills legal obligations. Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result \n\n Chemistry Department Chairman, stated that \"Jason's death prompted an examination of the role the department should play in graduate students' lives\". Anderson went on to promise that students will also have \"confidential and seamless access\" to psychological counselling services, paid for by the department. Harvard students currently have unlimited access to mental health services if seen by a psychologist or psychiatrist at University health services and up to 40 sessions of regular outside care with a copay as part of their continuing effort to provide access to mental health care. Responding to critics, Brown University President Christina Paxson and Provost Richard Locke said they had not infringed on academic freedom and stated that Brown's commitment to only \"publicize research that unassailably meets the highest standards of excellence\" required Brown to retract the press release after PLOS One opened an investigation on the paper in question.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Ulcerative colitis\nIn May 2018, the FDA approved tofacitinib citrate \"for the treatment of adult patients in the U.S. with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\" The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first three months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in  2% or more of patients treated with tofacitinib citrate monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis (the \"common cold\"). Laboratory monitoring is recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes, and lipids. In a mouse model of established arthritis, tofacitinib rapidly improved disease by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and suppressing STAT1-dependent genes in joint tissue. History\nThe potential significance of JAK3 inhibition was first discovered in the laboratory of John O'Shea, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The drug was coded as CP-690,550 during development. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two rheumatologists interviewed by the magazine Nature Biotechnology complained that they were \"shocked\" and \"disappointed\" at the $2,055 a month wholesale price. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib \"to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate. The FDA approved only the five-mg, twice-daily dose on the grounds that a higher dose was not considered to have an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio.

Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. An outbreak of cholera subsequently ensued with 517 confirmed cases in the Beira area between 24 and 31 March. The number of confirmed cases exceeded 1,500 by 3 April. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of \n\n Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. An increase in the incidence of malaria was noted, attributed to malarial mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks \n\n the region as a \"ticking bomb\". The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable. In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be \"endemic.\" Additionally, countries that have an occurrence of an epidemic can also be endemic. The longest standing V. chloerae epidemic was recorded in Yemen. The epidemic in Yemen took over 2,500 lives and impacted over 1 million people of Yemen More outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, and Haiti. Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice. Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology. Signs and symptoms \n\nThe primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals. Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\" because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids. Cause\n\nTransmission \nCholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton. Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water. People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as \"rice-water\", contaminates water used by others. A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of V. cholerae in the environment. The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person. V. cholerae also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus. One study indicates that the culturability of V. cholerae drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. By inserting separate, successive sections of V. cholerae DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as E. coli that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which V. cholerae responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Antibiotic resistance \nIn many areas of the world, antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin. In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States. Water, sanitation and hygiene \nAlthough cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices present there, cholera is rare. For example, the last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910–1911. Cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) infrastructure is still inadequate. Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:\n Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents. Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via human excreta. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to decontaminate the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases. Handwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa. Surveillance \n\nSurveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India. The World Health Organization (WHO) has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines (OCVs): Dukoral, Sanchol, and Euvichol. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccines—Dukoral (SBL Vaccines), containing a non-toxic B-subunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against V. cholerae O1; and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technology—ShanChol (Shantha Biotec) and Euvichol (EuBiologics Co.), which have bivalent O1 and O139 oral killed cholera vaccines. In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half. A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: \"Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success. Prognosis \nIf people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50–60%. For certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within two hours of becoming ill. Epidemiology \nCholera affects an estimated 2.8 million people worldwide, and causes approximately 95,000 deaths a year (uncertainty range: 21,000-143,000) . This occurs mainly in the developing world. It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country. Cholera remains both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world. In October 2016, an outbreak of cholera began in war-ravaged Yemen. WHO called it \"the worst cholera outbreak in the world\". Recent major outbreaks are the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and the 2016–2021 Yemen cholera outbreak. In 2019, 93% of the reported 923,037 cholera cases were from Yemen (with 1911 deaths reported). Between September 2019 and September 2020, a global total of over 450,000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported; however these numbers suffer from over-reporting from countries that report suspected cases (and not laboratory confirmed cases) as well as under-reporting from countries that do not report official cases (such as Bangladesh, India and Philippines). Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. After the end of the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak, there have not been any cholera cases in the Americas since February 2019.  the disease is endemic in Africa and some areas of Asia (Bangladesh, India and Yemen). History of outbreaks \n\nThe word cholera is from  kholera from χολή kholē \"bile\". Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries. The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to Russia in 1817, later to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world, (hence the name \"Asiatic cholera\"). Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years, with the seventh pandemic originating in Indonesia in 1961. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa. The movement of British Army and Navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic, since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the Indian Ocean, from Africa to Indonesia, and north to China and Japan. These epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics, while other areas, like Germany in 1892 (primarily the city of Hamburg where more than 8.600 people died) and Naples from 1910–1911, also experienced severe outbreaks. The seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists () in developing countries. Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in developing countries. In the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers were suffering from cholera. Cholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments. The United States, for example, used to have a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera. Research \n\nOne of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water. Indian medical scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered the cholera toxin, the animal model of cholera, and successfully demonstrate the method of transmission of cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. More recently, in 2002, Alam, et al., studied stool samples from patients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of V. cholerae through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the \"rice water\" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection. Global Strategy \nIn 2017, the WHO launched the \"Ending Cholera: a global roadmap to 2030\" strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030. The strategy was developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) which develops country-specific plans and monitors progress. The approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance, water sanitation, treatment and oral vaccines. Specifically, the control strategy focusses on three approaches: i) early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks, ii) stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots, and iii) a global framework for cholera control through the GTFCC. The WHO and the GTFCC do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal. Even though humans are the only host of cholera, the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host. While global eradication is not possible, elimination of human to human transmission may be possible; and local elimination is possible, most recently during the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak which aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022. Society and culture \n\n Health policy \nIn many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease. In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the James Baker Institute. The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well. Similarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers. According to Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute, if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of Vibrio cholerae specimens. Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important. Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection. 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Ten months after the 2010 earthquake, an outbreak swept over Haiti, traced to a United Nations base of peacekeepers from Nepal. This marks the worst cholera outbreak in recent history, as well as the best documented cholera outbreak in modern public health. In popular culture\nUnlike tuberculosis (\"consumption\") which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament, cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the lower-classes living in filth and poverty. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease – which includes voluminous \"rice-water\" diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death – has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even the actual factual presentation of the disease in popular culture. Contrary to the actual facts of how violently cholera kills, Mann has his protagonist die peacefully on a beach in a deck chair. *\n In Gabriel Garcia Márquez's 1985 novel Love in the Time of Cholera, cholera is \"a looming background presence rather than a central figure requiring vile description.\" Country examples \n\n Zambia \nIn Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, most commonly in the capital city of Lusaka. In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. With intensification of the rains, new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported. In collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples. The Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December. India \nIn the city of Kolkata, India in the state of West Bengal in the Ganges delta has been described as the \"homeland of cholera\", with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality. In India, where the disease is endemic, cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons. India is also characterized by high population density, unsafe drinking water, open drains, and poor sanitation which provide an optimal niche for survival, sustenance and transmission of Vibrio cholerae. Democratic Republic of Congo \nIn Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history. Cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology, basic membrane biology, and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design.

Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes\nFactors relating to male infertility include:\n\nImmune infertility \nAntisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics\nChromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome\nOne of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Men with this condition can exhibit azoospermia (no sperm production), oligozoospermia (small number of sperm production), or they will produce abnormally shaped sperm (teratozoospermia). Pre-testicular causes\nPre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:\n\nVaricocele \nVaricocele is a condition of swollen testicle veins. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. Drugs, alcohol\n Strenuous riding (bicycle riding, horseback riding)\n Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, cimetidine, spironolactone; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin\n Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation\n\nTobacco smoking\n\nThere is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles and kill sperm, but their effect on male fertility is not clear. Post-testicular causes\nPost-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation:\n Vas deferens obstruction\n Lack of Vas deferens, often related to genetic markers for cystic fibrosis\n Infection, e.g. prostatitis, male accessory gland infection\n Retrograde ejaculation\n Ejaculatory duct obstruction\n Hypospadias\n Impotence\n\nDiagnostic evaluations\nThe diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Medical history\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps orchitis, epididymitis), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, and drug use (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor. The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy (retrograde ejaculation), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply). The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2–7 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa. A single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. The volume of the semen sample (must be more than 1,5 ml), approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. This is also called as unexplained Infertility\nThere are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms \"oligoasthenoteratozoospermia\" or \"oligospermia\" can be used as a catch-all. - Drug stimulation\n\n- Percutaneous spermatozoa obtaining directly from epididymis, testes, etc. Neurological injury\n\n- Vibro-stimulation\n\n- Electro-stimulation\n Retrograde ejaculation\nThis type of ejaculation happens when there is a defect on prostate, so the sample is not ejaculated outside but to the bladder. - Just after that, the subject has to masturbate and ejaculate, obtaining then a new urine sample with ejaculation that will be stored on the second recipient. - Finally we have to obtain the next urine, 2nd urine, for potential ejaculation fraction, which will be stored in the third recipient. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Ultrasonography\nScrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer. Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele, when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. Prevention\nSome strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:\n Avoiding smoking as it damages sperm DNA\n Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions. Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved. Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF. A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. Giving oral antioxidants to men in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility may lead to an increase in the live birth rate but overall the risk of adverse effects is unclear. Hormonal therapy\n\nAdministration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, as seen in users of androgens/anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, including in men with severe oligospermia. Research\n\nResearchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis, including spermatozoa generation. Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, \"[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI's success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI's success depends.\" The population in different regions suffer from varying amounts of infertility. Starting in the late 20th century, scientists have expressed concerns about the declining semen quality in men. A study was done in 1992 with men who had never suffered from infertility showed that the amount of sperm in semen had declined by 1% per year since 1938. Doctors in India disclosed that the sperm count of a fertile Indian male had decreased by a third over a span of three decades. Researchers in Calcutta conducted a study between 1981 and 1985 that also showed a decrease in sperm motility and seminal volume, but no change in sperm concentration. Society and culture \nThere are a variety of social stigmas that surround male infertility throughout the world. A lot of research has pointed to the relationship between infertility and emasculation. In places like Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Mexico, erectile dysfunction also known as impotence, is considered a determinant of infertility. When stereotypical ideals of manhood are virility and strength, men sharing problems of infertility can face feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, and have thoughts of suicide. For the Shona people, since impotence is linked to infertility, an examination to check on the penile function spans from infancy to post marriage. At infancy, there are daily check-ups by the mothers on the son's erection and urine quality. When the son reaches puberty, they are asked to ejaculate in river banks and for their male elders to examine sperm quality.

The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy (retrograde ejaculation), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply). Sperm sample\n\nSemen sample obtaining \nSemen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2–7 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa. A single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. The volume of the semen sample (must be more than 1,5 ml), approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. This is also called as unexplained Infertility\nThere are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms \"oligoasthenoteratozoospermia\" or \"oligospermia\" can be used as a catch-all. - Drug stimulation\n\n- Percutaneous spermatozoa obtaining directly from epididymis, testes, etc. Neurological injury\n\n- Vibro-stimulation\n\n- Electro-stimulation\n Retrograde ejaculation\nThis type of ejaculation happens when there is a defect on prostate, so the sample is not ejaculated outside but to the bladder. - Just after that, the subject has to masturbate and ejaculate, obtaining then a new urine sample with ejaculation that will be stored on the second recipient. - Finally we have to obtain the next urine, 2nd urine, for potential ejaculation fraction, which will be stored in the third recipient. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Ultrasonography\nScrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer. Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele, when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. Prevention\nSome strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:\n Avoiding smoking as it damages sperm DNA\n Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions. Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved. Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF. A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. Giving oral antioxidants to men in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility may lead to an increase in the live birth rate but overall the risk of adverse effects is unclear. Hormonal therapy\n\nAdministration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, as seen in users of androgens/anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, including in men with severe oligospermia. Research\n\nResearchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis, including spermatozoa generation. Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, \"[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI's success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI's success depends.\" The population in different regions suffer from varying amounts of infertility. Starting in the late 20th century, scientists have expressed concerns about the declining semen quality in men. A study was done in 1992 with men who had never suffered from infertility showed that the amount of sperm in semen had declined by 1% per year since 1938. Doctors in India disclosed that the sperm count of a fertile Indian male had decreased by a third over a span of three decades. Researchers in Calcutta conducted a study between 1981 and 1985 that also showed a decrease in sperm motility and seminal volume, but no change in sperm concentration. Society and culture \nThere are a variety of social stigmas that surround male infertility throughout the world. A lot of research has pointed to the relationship between infertility and emasculation. In places like Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Mexico, erectile dysfunction also known as impotence, is considered a determinant of infertility. When stereotypical ideals of manhood are virility and strength, men sharing problems of infertility can face feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, and have thoughts of suicide. For the Shona people, since impotence is linked to infertility, an examination to check on the penile function spans from infancy to post marriage. At infancy, there are daily check-ups by the mothers on the son's erection and urine quality. When the son reaches puberty, they are asked to ejaculate in river banks and for their male elders to examine sperm quality.

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes\nFactors relating to male infertility include:\n\nImmune infertility \nAntisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics\nChromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome\nOne of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Men with this condition can exhibit azoospermia (no sperm production), oligozoospermia (small number of sperm production), or they will produce abnormally shaped sperm (teratozoospermia). Pre-testicular causes\nPre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:\n\nVaricocele \nVaricocele is a condition of swollen testicle veins. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. Drugs, alcohol\n Strenuous riding (bicycle riding, horseback riding)\n Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, cimetidine, spironolactone; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin\n Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation\n\nTobacco smoking\n\nThere is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles and kill sperm, but their effect on male fertility is not clear. Post-testicular causes\nPost-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation:\n Vas deferens obstruction\n Lack of Vas deferens, often related to genetic markers for cystic fibrosis\n Infection, e.g. prostatitis, male accessory gland infection\n Retrograde ejaculation\n Ejaculatory duct obstruction\n Hypospadias\n Impotence\n\nDiagnostic evaluations\nThe diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with head trauma. Simply put, it causes damage to brain cells that results in cell death and worsens over time. But as it develops, CTE can lead to worsening dementia and death. It was first identified in boxers in the 1920s as “punch-drunk” dementia and then “dementia pugilistica,” and its underlying pathology was described in 1973. Because of this, CTE may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s and FTD, though research has not yet confirmed this. Since 1973, CTE has been diagnosed in boxers, wrestlers, military veterans, and baseball, football, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer players. A 2015 report on the brain health risks of youth sports co-sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) also found that children who played contact sports were at risk of developing CTE later in life. But efforts are underway to develop diagnostic tools for living patients. The ADDF is funding Sam Gandy, MD, PhD, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for one such project. Dr. Gandy is using 18F-AV-1451, a PET imaging agent being developed by Avid Pharmaceuticals, to try to image tau tangles and threads in the brains of people who have sustained multiple head injuries. It could also be used to assess CTE risk in younger players by detecting the presence of tau in the brain after a head injury. At Harvard Medical School, Neil Vasdev, PhD, is also working on a tau imaging program with support from the ADDF. Dr. Vasdev is using 18F-MK-6240, a PET imaging agent created by Merck that binds to tau deposits in the brain in a different way. He and his team are testing their PET scan in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. Having multiple diagnostic tools is important for differentiating between the multiple diseases that involve tau. But their chances of success and ability to recruit the right patients will be greatly improved with tau diagnostics. It’s critical to understand what kind of tau—and therefore, which disease—a patient has they can test a treatment designed specifically for it. The Center focuses on research related to the long-term effects of brain trauma and degenerative brain diseases, specializing in the diagnosis and analysis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). According to researchers at Boston University, CTE is a brain disease involving progressive neurological deterioration common in athletes, military personnel, and others who have a history of brain trauma. Symptoms from CTE do not typically appear in a subject until many years after the initial injuries, and a conclusive diagnosis of the disease can only be achieved through autopsy. Although CTE remains mysterious and controversial, researchers have observed a link between the disease and the protein called tau, which slowly forms clumps in the brain that kill brain cells. This often results in subjects experiencing depression, anxiety, memory loss, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Mission and Practices \nThe goal of the Boston University CTE Center is to collect and study post-mortem brains to better understand the long-term diseases associated with head trauma. Specifically, the CTE Center focuses its research on the formation of neurodegenerative diseases, including Post-Concussion Syndrome and CTE. During case studies, researchers at the CTE Center perform high-impact tests and in-depth autopsies on post-mortem brains to further understand the neuropathology and clinical presentation of CTE. The Center's ultimate goal is to develop a test that would definitively diagnose CTE in a living subject. In order to accomplish this, researchers at Boston University made it a priority to study as many post-mortem brains as possible, which led to the formation of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. Currently, the Brain Bank contains over 600 brains, including 325 brains that have been diagnosed with CTE since the formation of the bank. Employees of the Brain Bank collect tissue samples from the central nervous system (brain, eyes, and spinal cord) of deceased athletes, most notably American football professionals, and military veterans. The Bank then stores these samples optimally to ensure proper care and treatment before, during, and after research testing. The Brain Bank directors will also share findings with family members and caregivers of the deceased. Her research focuses on CTE and the late effects of neurodegeneration. This publication discussed 47 instances of neuropathological deterioration determined to be CTE. The study was primarily conducted to develop a more accurate clinical presentation of CTE in the brain. Through in-depth autopsies, the researchers observed the formation of proteins in the brain that caused initial brain cell decay, ultimately leading to CTE in the brain. This study was released in 2015 and detailed the autopsies performed by researchers on the donated brains and brain tissue. These examinations were performed at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to identify important neuropathological characteristics of CTE, including how the brain deteriorates over time, and the distribution of proteins in brains with CTE. Through microscopic examination, the researchers were able to confirm the role of the tau protein in CTE diagnosis, as well as other proteins that are signs of this degenerative disease. From these post-mortem tests, researchers were able to detail the characteristics of the various stages of CTE. In the study, the Boston University researchers grouped the subjects into four distinct stages of CTE, with each stage increasing in severity. These increased donations allowed for a larger case study, which would give researchers an opportunity to paint a clearer picture of the disease in a brain. In addition, the most common cause of death among participants was neurodegeneration or suicide. Each brain was evaluated and CTE p-tau pathology for the brains were classified into a stage of CTE. These results suggested CTE might be related to participation in football, and higher levels of play may increase the likelihood of the disease. Potential Applications of CTE Research \nCurrent CTE research has primarily focused on how the disease could potentially impact the world of sports. As CTE continues to gain notoriety, research focus has shifted to developing a test for diagnosing the disease in a living person. By studying and diagnosing post mortem brains with CTE, researchers at the Boston University CTE Center have been able to map out the disease in the brain, specifically, the various proteins that develop in an affected brain. The most important of these proteins is the tau protein, that leads directly to the formation of the disease in the brain. This protein forms as a result of blows taken within the skull, resulting in rapid movement of the brain. By analyzing how and where this protein forms within the brain, researchers can potentially map the protein in living individuals, and predict the development of the disease. As research into the disease continues, leaders of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank hope to utilize their findings to develop methods for treating and preventing the disease.

The research found that they were suffering from the progressive degenerative brain disease that’s been linked to repeated head trauma. This landmark research was done by investigators at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) and the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, in collaboration with the Sports Legacy Institute (SLI). The study described 68 cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among deceased athletes and military veterans whose brain and spinal cords were donated to the VA CSTE Brain Bank. Dr. Ann McKee, professor at Boston University School of Medicine, director of the Neuropathology Service for VA New England Healthcare System and co-director of the CSTE, led the study, which is the first to characterize the pathology of the disease into four stages of severity. CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated brain trauma, including concussions and multiple subconcussive exposures such as those in contact sports and military combat, the press release explained. “In early stages, CTE is characterized by the presence of abnormal deposits of a protein called tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles and neuropil threads throughout the brain,” according to the release. “These tau lesions eventually lead to brain cell death. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. The report provides specific pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE and divides CTE into four stages of disease (Stages I-IV), according to the press release. “In Stage III, reported symptoms included cognitive impairment and problems with executive functions, specifically planning, organization, multitasking and judgment,” according to the release. One-third of the CTE cases were diagnosed with additional neurodegenerative disease, including: motor neuron disease (12 percent), Lewy body disease (16 percent), Alzheimer’s disease (11 percent) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (six percent). Researchers cautioned that further studies are needed to investigate the incidence and prevalence of CTE; whether the symptoms of CTE are distinct from other conditions; how genetics influence susceptibility or resistance to CTE; and whether other environmental exposures also play an additive role in the development of CTE. “While it remains unknown what level of exposure to brain trauma is required to trigger CTE, there is no available evidence that occasional, isolated or well-managed concussions give rise to CTE,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, a coauthor of the paper and co-director of CSTE as well as co-founder of SLI.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Inflammation has also been connected to depression,  and a 2016 study found broccoli sprouts effective to “prevent or minimize the relapse by inflammation.”  This same study found that the extracts of broccoli sprouts were so effective, they acted as a prophylactic that could “prevent the onset of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors” in the juvenile and adolescent mice they were testing, all the way into adulthood. More research is being done on the phytochemicals of cruciferous vegetables and depression. A 2000 study on female fibromyalgia patients reported that the combination of ascorbigen (derived from Vitamin C) and broccoli powder “reduces pain sensitivity and improves quality of life”  for patients suffering from this challenging condition. “[T]he results show that a relatively short dietary treatment with broccoli sprouts can strongly protect the heart against oxidative stress and cell death caused by ischemia-reperfusion.”  R Which is promising, indeed! One particularly interesting study was carried out on young male smokers, in which 250g/day of broccoli was consumed, for a ten-day period. In 2015 broccoli sprout extract was again found highly effective in reducing of oxidative stress,  in this case being observed to assist with healthy liver function. As anti-inflammatories go, sulforaphane is right up there with that king of all spices, curcumin (turmeric) giving our cruciferous vegetables the upper hand in the list of healing foods. “[T]he consumption of broccoli sprouts modulated the excretion of biomarkers linked to inflammation and vascular reactions,”  according to a 2015 study.

The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when \n\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (the HOPE Act) is a law that modifies rules regarding organ donation between HIV-positive individuals. The use of HIV-positive organs was previously a federal crime. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revised the Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988, a law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act shortened organ transplant wait times, including the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act amends the Public Health Service Act to repeal the requirement that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of donated organs that include standards for preventing the acquisition of organs infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations. Finally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to declare that an organ donation does not violate the prohibition against a knowing organ donation by an HIV-infected individual if the donation is made in accordance with this Act. The bill removes a provision in current law that prohibits the acquisition and procurement of donated organs that are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. S. 330 also requires the Secretary of HHS to develop guidelines for conducting research relating to organ transplants from donors who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medically approved way to treat people with tobacco use disorder by taking nicotine by means other than tobacco. It is used to help with quitting smoking or stopping chewing tobacco. It increases the chance of quitting tobacco smoking by about 55%. Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. They do not appear to increase the risk of heart attacks. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses\n\nNicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least six months. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms. Nicotine replacement products are most beneficial for heavy smokers who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a smoking cessation service based on pharmacotherapy in combination with counseling support. However, the investment in NHS stop smoking services is relatively low. Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows: “Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation” (p. 1260). Quit rates showed a dramatic decrease between 4-weeks and one year. A quit rate of 53% at four weeks fell to only 15% at one year. Younger smokers, females, pregnant smokers and more deprived smokers had lower quit rates than other groups. The efficacy for each of the formulations alone (lozenges, nasal spray, gum, and transdermal patch) to aid in smoking cessation is equal. Efficacy increases 15% to 36% with combining treatments such as gum and lozenges. Higher doses increase the chance of stopping smoking for a period of six months and more. E-cigarettes are twice as effective as NRT in helping people quit smoking. Pregnancy\nNicotine is not safe to use in any amount during pregnancy. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke. Thus, pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding should also consult a physician before initiating NRT. The gum, lozenge, and nasal spray are pregnancy category C. The transdermal patch is pregnancy category D. The transdermal patch is considered less safe for the fetus because it delivers continuous nicotine exposure, as opposed to the gum or lozenge, which delivers intermittent and thus lower nicotine exposure. Nicotine itself could be at least partly responsible for many of the adverse after birth health results related to cigarette use while the mother was pregnant. There is evidence that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes. There is also risk of stillbirth and pre-term birth. Nicotine use will probably harm fetal neurological development. Risks to the child later in life from nicotine exposure during pregnancy include type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy can result in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities in the child. It also puts the child at increased risk for nicotine addiction in the future. Evidence is unclear whether adolescents gain benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or smoking cessation over the long-term as of 2017. Smoking is known to cause cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Cigarette smoking is the cause of 20% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States, which is the leading cause of mortality. Other conditions \nNicotine replacement therapies should be used cautiously in individuals with the following conditions: severe reactive airway diseases (for nasal spray), chronic nasal disorders such as sinusitis, polyps, rhinitis, or allergy (for nasal spray), diabetes (insulin-dependent), gastrointestinal diseases such as esophagitis, active gastric or peptic ulcer disease, liver problems, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, phenylketonuria (for lozenges), renal problems, and skin conditions such as psoriasis or dermatitis (for the transdermal patch). Side effects\n\nSome side effects are caused by the nicotine, and are common to NRT products. Other common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. The nicotine patch can also cause strange dreams if worn while asleep. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning, which includes symptoms like visual disturbances, hyper-salivation, nausea, and vomiting; and continued addiction to nicotine products. Avoiding smoking and other products with nicotine are recommended since it may lead to nicotine overdose. Mechanism of action\n\nNicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings due to nicotine addiction. Smoking cigarettes releases high doses of nicotine to the brain in a matter of seconds as opposed to low doses released over a period of minutes to hours by the various forms of nicotine replacement therapy. NRT relies on systemic venous absorption, whereas nicotine from cigarettes reaches the arterial system. Nicotine replacement products vary in the time it takes for the nicotine to enter the body and the total time nicotine stays in the body. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk. Nicotine patches are applied to the skin and continuously administer a stable dose of nicotine slowly over 16–24 hours. Nicotine gum, nicotine sprays, nicotine toothpicks, nicotine sublingual tablets, and nicotine lozenges administer nicotine orally with quicker nicotine uptake into the body but lasting a shorter amount of time. Nicotine inhalers are metered-dose inhalers  that administer nicotine through the lungs and mucous membranes of the throat quickly, lasting for a short amount of time. For example, blood nicotine levels are the highest 5–10 minutes after using the nicotine nasal spray, 20 minutes after using a nicotine inhaler or chewing nicotine gum, and 2–4 hours after using a nicotine patch. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Formulations \n\nThe nicotine patch is a once-daily, longer-acting form of NRT. An advantage of the nicotine patch is its simple compliance; it does not require active use throughout the day. The gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, oral inhaler, oral spray, and nasal spray are acutely dosed products, providing the user with the benefit and ability of self-titrating based on cravings. Medicines \nIn 2015, the United States Public Health Service listed seven agents for the stopping of tobacco, which included five nicotine replacement treatments (nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays) and two oral medications (bupropion and varenicline). Other NRT options are available, including nicotine mouth sprays and sublingual tablets. Dosing\nThe dose of nicotine replacement therapy products is generally based on if the user is considered a heavy, average, or light smoker. Combining nicotine patch treatment with a faster nicotine-delivery means, like nicotine gum or spray, improves the likelihood of successful treatment. Not approved as NRTs\n\nSome smokeless consumer products available can function as alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) but they have not received FDA approval as smoking-cessation therapy aids that are safe and effective. Snus and nasal snuff also allow for nicotine administration outside of tobacco smoking. Nicotine pouches are described as similar to or a tobacco-free variant of snus. They are pre-portioned and are held in the user's lip or cheek allowing for sublingual or buccal delivery of flavors and high doses of nicotine. The evidence is that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than NRT methods. They have been marketed as less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, but very few are as yet approved as NRTs in any jurisdiction. Some healthcare groups have hesitated to recommend e-cigarettes for quitting smoking, because of limited evidence of effectiveness and safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of additional tobacco products they are seeking to regulate, including electronic cigarettes. Most approved NRT products have been approved for over 20 years, however the FDA has also approved nicotine inhalers as a form of NRT. Future approaches of NRT could include nicotine preloading, a true pulmonary inhaler, and nicotine vaccines. The true pulmonary inhaler would deliver nicotine to the lungs in a manner that more resembles cigarette smoking, which would provide better relief of background cravings as well as acute cravings. Nicotine vaccines are under investigation as a method to treat tobacco dependence through priming the body to mount an immune response against nicotine.

Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\"), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. The most frequent unassisted methods were \"cold turkey\", a term that has been used to mean either unassisted quitting or abrupt quitting and \"gradually decreased number\" of cigarettes, or \"cigarette reduction\". In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was \"not at all difficult\" to stop, 27% said it was \"fairly difficult\", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Single medications include:\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50 to 60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. A study found that 93% of over-the-counter NRT users relapse and return to smoking within six months. Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline is higher than with bupropion or NRT. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries \"did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo\". There is no good evidence anxiolytics are helpful. But it is important to know that the manufacturers of rimonabant and taranabant stopped production in 2008 due to its serious side effects. The 2008 US Guideline specifies that three combinations of medications are effective:\nLong-term nicotine patch and ad libitum NRT gum or spray\nNicotine patch and nicotine inhaler\nNicotine patch and bupropion (the only combination that the US FDA has approved for smoking cessation)\n\nA meta-analysis from 2018, conducted on 61 RCTs, showed that during their first year of trying to quit, approximately 80% of the participants in the studies who got drug assistance (bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) returned to smoking while 20% continued to not smoke for the entire year (i.e. In comparison, 12% the people who got placebo kept from smoking for (at least) an entire year. In other words, out of 100 people who will take medication, approximately 8 of them would remain non-smoking after one year thanks to the treatment. During the course of one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months. Cutting down to quit\nGradual reduction involves slowly reducing one's daily intake of nicotine. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation. When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can have positive effects on quitting for six months and longer. It is estimated that \"comprehensive clean indoor laws\" can increase smoking cessation rates by 12%–38%. The US Task Force on Community Preventive Services found \"strong scientific evidence\" that this is effective in increasing tobacco use cessation  It is estimated that an increase in price of 10% will increase smoking cessation rates by 3–5%. This analysis distinguished between reactive (smokers calling quitlines) and proactive (smokers receiving calls) interventions. There is about 10% to 25% increase of the chance of smoking cessation success with the more behavioral support provided in person or via telephone when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Group or individual psychological support can help people who want to quit. Each session is designed to help smokers gain control over their behavior. Biochemical feedback\nVarious methods exist which allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use, and the immediate effects of quitting. Using biochemical feedback methods can allow tobacco-users to be identified and assessed, and the use of monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit. Evidence wise, little is known about the effects of using biomechanical tests to determine a person's risk related to smoking cessation. Within hours of quitting, CO concentrations show a noticeable decrease, and this can be encouraging for someone working to quit. Breath CO monitoring has been utilized in smoking cessation as a tool to provide patients with biomarker feedback, similar to the way in which other diagnostic tools such as the stethoscope, the blood pressure cuff, and the cholesterol test have been used by treatment professionals in medicine. Like carbon monoxide, a cotinine test can serve as a reliable biomarker to determine smoking status. Even brief advice from physicians may have \"a small effect on cessation rates\" and there is evidence that the physicians' probability of giving smoking cessation advice declines with the person who smokes age. Another review found some positive effects when trained community pharmacists support the customers in their smoking cessation trials. Dental professionals also provide a key component in increasing tobacco abstinence rates in the community through counseling patients on the effects of tobacco on oral health in conjunction with an oral exam. According to the 2008 Guideline, based on two studies the training of clinicians in smoking cessation methods may increase abstinence rates; however, a Cochrane review found and measured that such training decreased smoking in patients. In one systematic review and meta-analysis, multi-component interventions increased quit rates in primary care settings. \"Multi-component\" interventions were defined as those that combined two or more of the following strategies known as the \"5 A's\":\nAsk — Systematically identify all tobacco users at every visit\nAdvise — Strongly urge all tobacco users to quit\nAssess — Determine willingness to make a quit attempt\nAssist — Aid the patient in quitting (provide counselling-style support and medication)\nArrange — Ensure follow-up contact\n\nSubstitutes for cigarettes\n\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the general term for using products that contain nicotine but not tobacco to aid cessation of smoking. These include nicotine lozenges that are sucked, nicotine gum and inhalers, nicotine patches, as well as electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarette:   There is moderate certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase success rates for quitting compared to ECs without nicotine and NRT. The available evidence for their effectiveness in abstaining from smoking is inconclusive. A 2016 UK Royal College of Physicians report supports the use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. Alternative approaches\nAcupuncture: Acupuncture has been explored as an adjunct treatment method for smoking cessation. Chewing cinnamon sticks or gum has been recommended when trying to quit the use of tobacco. However, a randomized trial published in 2008 found that hypnosis and nicotine patches \"compares favorably\" with standard behavioral counseling and nicotine patches in 12-month quit rates. However, the report by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) concludes \"STP (smokeless tobacco products) are addictive and their use is hazardous to health. A recent national study on the use of alternative tobacco products, including snus, did not show that these products promote cessation. A Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient evidence of its efficacy. Nicotine vaccines: Nicotine vaccines (e.g., NicVAX and TA-NIC) work by reducing the amount of nicotine reaching the brain; however, this method of therapy needs more investigations to establish its role and determine its side effects. Children and adolescents\nMethods used with children and adolescents include:\nMotivational enhancement\nPsychological support\nYouth anti-tobacco activities, such as sport involvement\nSchool-based curricula, such as life-skills training\nSchool-based nurse counseling sessions\nAccess reduction to tobacco\nAnti-tobacco media\nFamily communication\nCochrane reviews, mainly of studies combining motivational enhancement and psychological support, concluded that \"complex approaches\" for smoking cessation among young people show promise. Neither the Cochrane review nor the 2008 Guideline recommends medications for adolescents who smoke. The 2008 US Guideline determined that \"person-to-person psychosocial interventions\" (typically including \"intensive counseling\") increased abstinence rates in pregnant women who smoke to 13.3%, compared with 7.6% in usual care. In addition, these babies have weaker immune systems, making them more susceptible to many diseases such as middle ear inflammations and asthmatic bronchitis as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, all of which can bring significant morbidity. Additionally, a study published by American Academy of Pediatrics shows that smoking during pregnancy increases the chance of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). There is also an increased chance that the child will be a smoker in adulthood. It is a myth that a female smoker can cause harm to a fetus by quitting immediately upon discovering she is pregnant. Schizophrenia\n\nStudies across 20 countries show a strong association between patients with schizophrenia and smoking. For example, in the United States, 80% or more of people with schizophrenia smoke, compared to 20% of the general population in 2006. A 2010 systematic review determined that worksite incentives and competitions needed to be combined with additional interventions to produce significant increases in smoking cessation rates. Hospitalized smokers\n\nSmokers who are hospitalised may be particularly motivated to quit. Patients undergoing elective surgery may get benefits of preoperative smoking cessation interventions, when starting 4–8 weeks before surgery with weekly counseling intervention for behavioral support and use of nicotine replacement therapy. A higher correlation with smoking has also been seen in people diagnosed with major depressive disorder at any time throughout the duration of their lifetime as compared to those without the diagnosis. Success rates in quitting smoking were lower for those with a major depressive disorder diagnosis versus people without the diagnosis. Exposure of cigarette smoke early on in life during pregnancy, infancy, or adolescence may negatively impact a child's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders in the future. These unique barriers can be combated through pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling for high levels of nicotine dependence, emphasis of immediate financial benefits to those who concern themselves with the short-term over the long-term, partnering with shelters to reduce the social acceptability of smoking in this population, and increased taxes on cigarettes and on alternative tobacco products to further make the addiction more difficult to fund. People in treatment for or recovery from substance use disorders \nOver three-quarters of people in treatment for substance use are current smokers. Providing counseling and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy such as patches or gum, varenicline, and/or bupropion) increases tobacco abstinence without increasing the risk of returning to other substance use. Robert West and Saul Shiffman, authorities in this field recognized by government health departments in a number of countries, have concluded that, used together, \"behavioral support\" and \"medication\" can quadruple the chances that a quit attempt will be successful. A 2008 systematic review in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention found that group behavioural therapy was the most effective intervention strategy for smoking cessation, followed by bupropion, intensive physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual counselling, telephone counselling, nursing interventions, and tailored self-help interventions; the study did not discuss varenicline. Factors affecting success\nQuitting can be harder for individuals with dark pigmented skin compared to individuals with pale skin since nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues. Studies suggest this can cause the phenomenon of increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rate in darker pigmented individuals. There is an important social component to smoking. The spread of smoking cessation from person to person contributes to the decrease in smoking these years. Smokers who are trying to quit are faced with social influences that may persuade them to conform and continue smoking. If a person who stopped smoking has close relationships with active smokers, he or she is often put into situations that make the urge to conform more tempting. Recent research from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey of over 6,000 smokers found that smokers with fewer smoking friends were more likely to intend to quit and to succeed in their quit attempt. Smokers with major depressive disorder may be less successful at quitting smoking than non-depressed smokers. In contrast, varenicline is suggested to have some effects and nicotine replacement therapy may help the unassisted abstainers. Smoking suppresses appetite, which may be caused by nicotine's effect on central autonomic neurons (e.g., via regulation of melanin concentrating hormone neurons in the hypothalamus). Possible reasons for this phenomenon include nicotine's ability to increase energy metabolism or nicotine's effect on peripheral neurons. The 2008 Guideline suggests that sustained-release bupropion, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge be used \"to delay weight gain after quitting.\" Therefore, when people stop smoking, depressive symptoms such as suicidal tendencies or actual depression may result, although a recent international study comparing smokers who had stopped for 3 months with continuing smokers found that stopping smoking did not appear to increase anxiety or depression. This side effect of smoking cessation may be particularly common in women, as depression is more common among women than among men. Health benefits\n\nMany of tobacco's detrimental health effects can be reduced or largely removed through smoking cessation. A randomized trial from the U.S. and Canada showed that a smoking cessation program lasting 10 weeks decreased mortality from all causes over 14 years later. A recent article on mortality in a cohort of 8,645 smokers who were followed-up after 43 years determined that \"current smoking and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD [cardiovascular disease], COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], and any cancer, and lung cancer mortality.\" The findings were: 1) taken together, the studies demonstrated decreased the likelihood of postoperative complications in patients who ceased smoking prior to surgery; 2) overall, each week of cessation prior to surgery increased the magnitude of the effect by 19%.

When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can have positive effects on quitting for six months and longer. It is estimated that \"comprehensive clean indoor laws\" can increase smoking cessation rates by 12%–38%. The US Task Force on Community Preventive Services found \"strong scientific evidence\" that this is effective in increasing tobacco use cessation  It is estimated that an increase in price of 10% will increase smoking cessation rates by 3–5%. This analysis distinguished between reactive (smokers calling quitlines) and proactive (smokers receiving calls) interventions. There is about 10% to 25% increase of the chance of smoking cessation success with the more behavioral support provided in person or via telephone when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Group or individual psychological support can help people who want to quit. Each session is designed to help smokers gain control over their behavior. Biochemical feedback\nVarious methods exist which allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use, and the immediate effects of quitting. Using biochemical feedback methods can allow tobacco-users to be identified and assessed, and the use of monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit. Evidence wise, little is known about the effects of using biomechanical tests to determine a person's risk related to smoking cessation. Within hours of quitting, CO concentrations show a noticeable decrease, and this can be encouraging for someone working to quit. Breath CO monitoring has been utilized in smoking cessation as a tool to provide patients with biomarker feedback, similar to the way in which other diagnostic tools such as the stethoscope, the blood pressure cuff, and the cholesterol test have been used by treatment professionals in medicine. Like carbon monoxide, a cotinine test can serve as a reliable biomarker to determine smoking status. Even brief advice from physicians may have \"a small effect on cessation rates\" and there is evidence that the physicians' probability of giving smoking cessation advice declines with the person who smokes age. Another review found some positive effects when trained community pharmacists support the customers in their smoking cessation trials. Dental professionals also provide a key component in increasing tobacco abstinence rates in the community through counseling patients on the effects of tobacco on oral health in conjunction with an oral exam. According to the 2008 Guideline, based on two studies the training of clinicians in smoking cessation methods may increase abstinence rates; however, a Cochrane review found and measured that such training decreased smoking in patients. In one systematic review and meta-analysis, multi-component interventions increased quit rates in primary care settings. \"Multi-component\" interventions were defined as those that combined two or more of the following strategies known as the \"5 A's\":\nAsk — Systematically identify all tobacco users at every visit\nAdvise — Strongly urge all tobacco users to quit\nAssess — Determine willingness to make a quit attempt\nAssist — Aid the patient in quitting (provide counselling-style support and medication)\nArrange — Ensure follow-up contact\n\nSubstitutes for cigarettes\n\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the general term for using products that contain nicotine but not tobacco to aid cessation of smoking. These include nicotine lozenges that are sucked, nicotine gum and inhalers, nicotine patches, as well as electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarette:   There is moderate certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase success rates for quitting compared to ECs without nicotine and NRT. The available evidence for their effectiveness in abstaining from smoking is inconclusive. A 2016 UK Royal College of Physicians report supports the use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. Alternative approaches\nAcupuncture: Acupuncture has been explored as an adjunct treatment method for smoking cessation. Chewing cinnamon sticks or gum has been recommended when trying to quit the use of tobacco. However, a randomized trial published in 2008 found that hypnosis and nicotine patches \"compares favorably\" with standard behavioral counseling and nicotine patches in 12-month quit rates. However, the report by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) concludes \"STP (smokeless tobacco products) are addictive and their use is hazardous to health. A recent national study on the use of alternative tobacco products, including snus, did not show that these products promote cessation. A Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient evidence of its efficacy. Nicotine vaccines: Nicotine vaccines (e.g., NicVAX and TA-NIC) work by reducing the amount of nicotine reaching the brain; however, this method of therapy needs more investigations to establish its role and determine its side effects. Children and adolescents\nMethods used with children and adolescents include:\nMotivational enhancement\nPsychological support\nYouth anti-tobacco activities, such as sport involvement\nSchool-based curricula, such as life-skills training\nSchool-based nurse counseling sessions\nAccess reduction to tobacco\nAnti-tobacco media\nFamily communication\nCochrane reviews, mainly of studies combining motivational enhancement and psychological support, concluded that \"complex approaches\" for smoking cessation among young people show promise. Neither the Cochrane review nor the 2008 Guideline recommends medications for adolescents who smoke. The 2008 US Guideline determined that \"person-to-person psychosocial interventions\" (typically including \"intensive counseling\") increased abstinence rates in pregnant women who smoke to 13.3%, compared with 7.6% in usual care. In addition, these babies have weaker immune systems, making them more susceptible to many diseases such as middle ear inflammations and asthmatic bronchitis as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, all of which can bring significant morbidity. Additionally, a study published by American Academy of Pediatrics shows that smoking during pregnancy increases the chance of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). There is also an increased chance that the child will be a smoker in adulthood. It is a myth that a female smoker can cause harm to a fetus by quitting immediately upon discovering she is pregnant. Schizophrenia\n\nStudies across 20 countries show a strong association between patients with schizophrenia and smoking. For example, in the United States, 80% or more of people with schizophrenia smoke, compared to 20% of the general population in 2006. A 2010 systematic review determined that worksite incentives and competitions needed to be combined with additional interventions to produce significant increases in smoking cessation rates. Hospitalized smokers\n\nSmokers who are hospitalised may be particularly motivated to quit. Patients undergoing elective surgery may get benefits of preoperative smoking cessation interventions, when starting 4–8 weeks before surgery with weekly counseling intervention for behavioral support and use of nicotine replacement therapy. A higher correlation with smoking has also been seen in people diagnosed with major depressive disorder at any time throughout the duration of their lifetime as compared to those without the diagnosis. Success rates in quitting smoking were lower for those with a major depressive disorder diagnosis versus people without the diagnosis. Exposure of cigarette smoke early on in life during pregnancy, infancy, or adolescence may negatively impact a child's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders in the future. These unique barriers can be combated through pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling for high levels of nicotine dependence, emphasis of immediate financial benefits to those who concern themselves with the short-term over the long-term, partnering with shelters to reduce the social acceptability of smoking in this population, and increased taxes on cigarettes and on alternative tobacco products to further make the addiction more difficult to fund. People in treatment for or recovery from substance use disorders \nOver three-quarters of people in treatment for substance use are current smokers. Providing counseling and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy such as patches or gum, varenicline, and/or bupropion) increases tobacco abstinence without increasing the risk of returning to other substance use. Robert West and Saul Shiffman, authorities in this field recognized by government health departments in a number of countries, have concluded that, used together, \"behavioral support\" and \"medication\" can quadruple the chances that a quit attempt will be successful. A 2008 systematic review in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention found that group behavioural therapy was the most effective intervention strategy for smoking cessation, followed by bupropion, intensive physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual counselling, telephone counselling, nursing interventions, and tailored self-help interventions; the study did not discuss varenicline. Factors affecting success\nQuitting can be harder for individuals with dark pigmented skin compared to individuals with pale skin since nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues. Studies suggest this can cause the phenomenon of increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rate in darker pigmented individuals. There is an important social component to smoking. The spread of smoking cessation from person to person contributes to the decrease in smoking these years. Smokers who are trying to quit are faced with social influences that may persuade them to conform and continue smoking. If a person who stopped smoking has close relationships with active smokers, he or she is often put into situations that make the urge to conform more tempting. Recent research from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey of over 6,000 smokers found that smokers with fewer smoking friends were more likely to intend to quit and to succeed in their quit attempt. Smokers with major depressive disorder may be less successful at quitting smoking than non-depressed smokers. In contrast, varenicline is suggested to have some effects and nicotine replacement therapy may help the unassisted abstainers. Smoking suppresses appetite, which may be caused by nicotine's effect on central autonomic neurons (e.g., via regulation of melanin concentrating hormone neurons in the hypothalamus). Possible reasons for this phenomenon include nicotine's ability to increase energy metabolism or nicotine's effect on peripheral neurons. The 2008 Guideline suggests that sustained-release bupropion, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge be used \"to delay weight gain after quitting.\" Therefore, when people stop smoking, depressive symptoms such as suicidal tendencies or actual depression may result, although a recent international study comparing smokers who had stopped for 3 months with continuing smokers found that stopping smoking did not appear to increase anxiety or depression. This side effect of smoking cessation may be particularly common in women, as depression is more common among women than among men. Health benefits\n\nMany of tobacco's detrimental health effects can be reduced or largely removed through smoking cessation. A randomized trial from the U.S. and Canada showed that a smoking cessation program lasting 10 weeks decreased mortality from all causes over 14 years later. A recent article on mortality in a cohort of 8,645 smokers who were followed-up after 43 years determined that \"current smoking and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD [cardiovascular disease], COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], and any cancer, and lung cancer mortality.\" The findings were: 1) taken together, the studies demonstrated decreased the likelihood of postoperative complications in patients who ceased smoking prior to surgery; 2) overall, each week of cessation prior to surgery increased the magnitude of the effect by 19%.

Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\"), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. The most frequent unassisted methods were \"cold turkey\", a term that has been used to mean either unassisted quitting or abrupt quitting and \"gradually decreased number\" of cigarettes, or \"cigarette reduction\". In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was \"not at all difficult\" to stop, 27% said it was \"fairly difficult\", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Single medications include:\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50 to 60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. A study found that 93% of over-the-counter NRT users relapse and return to smoking within six months. Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline is higher than with bupropion or NRT. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries \"did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo\". There is no good evidence anxiolytics are helpful. But it is important to know that the manufacturers of rimonabant and taranabant stopped production in 2008 due to its serious side effects. The 2008 US Guideline specifies that three combinations of medications are effective:\nLong-term nicotine patch and ad libitum NRT gum or spray\nNicotine patch and nicotine inhaler\nNicotine patch and bupropion (the only combination that the US FDA has approved for smoking cessation)\n\nA meta-analysis from 2018, conducted on 61 RCTs, showed that during their first year of trying to quit, approximately 80% of the participants in the studies who got drug assistance (bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) returned to smoking while 20% continued to not smoke for the entire year (i.e. In comparison, 12% the people who got placebo kept from smoking for (at least) an entire year. In other words, out of 100 people who will take medication, approximately 8 of them would remain non-smoking after one year thanks to the treatment. During the course of one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months. Cutting down to quit\nGradual reduction involves slowly reducing one's daily intake of nicotine. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation.

The research suggests that homosexuality is a deep-seated predisposition with a biological origin, similar to heterosexuality. The studies conducted by Kinsey and colleagues, for example, indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be attributed to a single social or psychological cause. One line of evidence supporting the biological basis of homosexuality involves morphological studies of the hypothalamus. Additionally, LeVay discovered that a specific cluster of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is larger in heterosexual men compared to women, as well as heterosexual men compared to homosexual men. Genetic studies also point towards a biological basis for homosexuality. Data from multiple studies show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins and 13 percent of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Inheritance patterns of male homosexuality often implicate a gene on the X chromosome, particularly from the maternal side. It is worth mentioning that psychoanalytic explanations and attempts to prove an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been substantiated by scientific evidence. The current consensus is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, although it may result in secondary reactive disturbances at times. Overall, the evidence from studies on brain morphology and genetics supports the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis. - LeVay, S. \"A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men.\" \"A gene(s) for homosexuality?.\" Evidence supporting the hypothesis that differences in genetic patterning of the nervous system contribute to sexual orientation includes various studies investigating the morphological differences in the hypothalamus and genetic studies. Pooled data from multiple studies have shown that approximately 57% of identical twins and 13% of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Most studies suggest that the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome. However, it is important to note that suggesting a simple genetic connection oversimplifies the complex nature of sexual orientation. It is worth mentioning that attempts to establish an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been successful, and psychoanalytic explanations of homosexuality have not been substantiated. Overall, the current widely held view is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, but rather a result of various factors including genetic and possibly early life differences in the genetic patterning of the nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus. - LeVay S. A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men. Evidence for a biological influence in male homosexuality. The studies of Kinsey and colleagues indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be traced to a single social or psychologic root.The most widely held current view is that homosexuality is not a mental or a personality disorder, though it may at times lead to secondary reactive disturbances.Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed.The authors favor the hypothesis that differences or variations in genetic patterning of the nervous system (possibly of the hypothalamus) set the sexual predilection during early life. If confirmed, these findings, which have been disputed by Byne and others, would support the view that homosexuality has a biologic basis. Pooled data from 5 studies in men show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins (and 13 percent of brothers) of homosexual men are also homosexual. In most studies, the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome (LeVay and Hamer) but to suggest there is a simple genetic connection is oversimplified. Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed. They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\". However, in the same study, the authors noted that \"nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out\" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing \"social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way\" (and thus seek out a greater number \n\n of the multiple causes of homosexuality. In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men.

Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. 1Department of Neurosurgery, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). The results obtained by these methods should be interpreted in the context of clinical, electrographic, and MRI data. Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy. As a result, patients with medically intractable TLE should undergo surgery as soon as possible (1,2). This prospective pilot study was conducted on 12 patients entailing five males and seven females, who aged between 2 and 16 years old with medically refractory mesial TLE confirmed by a pediatric neurologist. All the patients underwent MRI scanning, and if MRI did not reveal any abnormality, SPECT was performed. Interictal preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) was performed for all the patients in addition to pre- and post-operative (one year later) neuropsychological tests. Both EEG and neuropsychological examinations were accomplished in a blinded manner. These data were not taken into account during the process of surgical decision-making. The surgical outcomes were categorized to three classes including class I (seizure-free or simple partial seizures only), class II (worthwhile improvement [≥90%]), and no worthwhile improvement. The follow-up period ranged between 12 and 48 months, with mean and standard deviation of 24±5 months. Moreover, at the post-operative phase, no continuous video-EEG monitoring, PET, Wada test, or SPECT was performed. No mortality occurred in any of the patients. In these two patients, the postoperative MRI revealed a posterior temporal cortical damage. TLE can be treated through surgical procedures. Clinical characteristics of children undergoing TLE surgery including seizure types, histopathology, EEG findings, postoperative seizure, and neuropsychological outcomes may provide important information on the effect of surgery on TLE. The outcomes of temporal lobectomy was significantly better than antiepileptic drugs (AED) treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to postpone presurgical evaluation in case of medical intractability. Moreover, children with intractable seizures show intellectual decline over time; accordingly, surgery is the gold standard of treatment at earlier stages to reduce the severity of cognitive impairment (7). It is indicated that TLE surgery is a safe and effective method to treat children with intractable epilepsy (8,9). found that TLE surgery was able to keep patients seizure-free for almost up to two decades (10). This result was consistent with the results obtained by a study performed in the Cleveland Clinic. Another study conducted on 52 children and adults with medically intractable TLE demonstrated that 63.2% of the children and 72.7% of the adults became seizure-free after the operation (9). TLE surgery may impair memory, generally verbal memory and spatial learning disorders may happen following left-and right-sided temporal lobe resection. There is a greater risk for postoperative memory decline in patients with poorer presurgical mood (15). In a study with a follow-up duration of shorter than two years, no improvement of intellectual functioning was found (17). Therefore, a longer follow-up interval is required for cognitive recovery. carried out a study on the results of a nine years follow-up of 42 children underwent TLE surgery and showed a significant improvement in IQ after a follow-up period of more than five years in the surgical group, while the non-surgical control group did not show this increase (18). found the predictive factors of memory decline including good preoperative performance, left-hemisphere language dominance according to the Wada test, and adult age of seizure onset. In children, a safe and effective procedure to control seizure for intractable epilepsy is temporal lobe resection. Due to the shorter epilepsy duration and greater neuroplasticity in children compared to adults, the success in children is more probable. As a result, to improve long-term prognosis, early diagnosis of intractable epilepsy and referral for surgical treatment are critical. Williamson PD, French JA, Thadani VM, et al.

This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. There are several procedures that have shown efficacy:\n\nWhat are the different types of clinical seizures? Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language. When our second child was diagnosed with a serious, debilitating illness called infantile spasms, it seemed that our dream would be dashed. The morning of her appointment with her pediatrician Eliana was sitting in her baby seat and she had a series of the movements in a row. Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy. For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of brain damage that occurred after birth. The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, encephalitis), head injuries with brain damage, brain tumors, or intracranial bleeding. The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic drugs, which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral. When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures. Surgery is indicated in a small group of children. Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, brain tumors, scars due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of vascular malformations that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised. In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits. Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other. The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. VNS seems to be effective in a variety of seizure disorders and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery. What are the risks of VNS implantation? Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery. Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. \"Seizures and Epilepsy in Children: Initial Treatment and Monitoring.\" What are epilepsy medications? Learn the epilepsy definition, symptoms, and treatment. How did your doctor decide whether to recommend surgery for you or your child's epilepsy? How has you or your child's life changed following epilepsy surgery? This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Hemispherectomy was revitalized in children in the 1980s by John M. Freeman and Ben Carson at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery. Patient criteria \nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. One such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. In one study of children under 5 who had this surgery to treat catastrophic epilepsy, 73.7% were freed of all seizures. The success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life. The conclusion: “adult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and most profit from surgery in several quality of life domains.”\n\nUltimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater. Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies. For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5. Previously, she had suffered from Rasmussen's encephalitis, which caused her to experience around 150 seizures a day.

Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine's introduction worldwide. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Side effects of immunization are generally mild and go away without any specific treatment. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given while breastfeeding. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. Medical use\n\nCochrane concluded that the \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.\" Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the U.S. each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic there. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities. Mumps\nMumps is another viral disease that was once very common, especially during childhood. Administration\nThe MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection, the first dose typically at 12 months of age. Safety\n\nAdverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add \"difficulty walking\" to the package inserts. This report also rejected any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. The number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events. A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism or other disorders acquired soon after administration of MMR vaccine, while supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\", and The Lancet fully retracted the paper. The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the British Medical Journal. Since Wakefield's publication, multiple peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library review have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link. Before publication of Wakefield's findings, the inoculation rate for MMR in the UK was 92%; after publication, the rate dropped to below 80%. In Japan, the MMR triplet is not used. Immunity is achieved by a combination vaccine for measles and rubella, followed up later with a mumps only vaccine. This has had no effect on autism rates in the country, further disproving the MMR autism hypothesis. Enders’ Edmonston strain has been used since 1999 in Hungary in Merck MMR II product. In a 2012 study pediatricians and family doctors were sent a survey to gauge their awareness of the increased risk of febrile seizures (fever fits) in the MMRV. 74% of family doctors and 29% of pediatricians were unaware of the increased risk of febrile seizures.

After two doses, 97% of people are protected against measles, 88% against mumps, and at least 97% against rubella. Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine's introduction worldwide. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Side effects of immunization are generally mild and go away without any specific treatment. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given while breastfeeding. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMR vaccine is a mixture of live weakened viruses of the three diseases. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. Medical use\n\nCochrane concluded that the \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.\" Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the U.S. each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic there. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities. Mumps\nMumps is another viral disease that was once very common, especially during childhood. Administration\nThe MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection, the first dose typically at 12 months of age. Safety\n\nAdverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add \"difficulty walking\" to the package inserts. This report also rejected any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. The number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events. A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism or other disorders acquired soon after administration of MMR vaccine, while supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\", and The Lancet fully retracted the paper. The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the British Medical Journal. Since Wakefield's publication, multiple peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library review have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link. Before publication of Wakefield's findings, the inoculation rate for MMR in the UK was 92%; after publication, the rate dropped to below 80%. In Japan, the MMR triplet is not used. Immunity is achieved by a combination vaccine for measles and rubella, followed up later with a mumps only vaccine. This has had no effect on autism rates in the country, further disproving the MMR autism hypothesis. Enders’ Edmonston strain has been used since 1999 in Hungary in Merck MMR II product. In a 2012 study pediatricians and family doctors were sent a survey to gauge their awareness of the increased risk of febrile seizures (fever fits) in the MMRV. 74% of family doctors and 29% of pediatricians were unaware of the increased risk of febrile seizures.

This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally \n\n prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. There have been claims suggesting a potential relationship between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism in children with bowel symptoms. These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Mozambique’s National Director of Medical Care says vaccination campaign has succeeded in covering 84% of the target. The deputy representative for UNICEF in Mozambique, Michel Le Pechoux said there are still more than thirty-five hundred confirmed cases. World Health Organization recently provided the country with 900,000 anti-cholera vaccines. Delft Institute for Water Education, and their peers from Uganda and Tanzania, have found traces of 25 DNA virus families in underground water in the slums of Kampala and Arusha. The findings, which were presented at the assembly of the European Geo-Sciences Union in Vienna on Monday, showed most groundwater in the two slums contains traces of Harpis virus, Pox virus and Papilloma virus. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable. humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe. A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10 April. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be at least $2.2 billion (2019 USD), with US$1 billion alone in infrastructure damages, making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin. Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.
