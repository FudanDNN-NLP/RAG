Jerry asks the wymp if he can take them to the moon to see his kite and the wymp obliges. Before they are swallowed up by the setting of the moon, the children ride the kite back home, showing all the other children in the village that the kite really could fly. The kite, however, returns to the sky and remains a comet for the rest of time. A young boy named Jerry made the largest kite in the town with his own hands. His friend, Chubby – the woodcutter's daughter – painted a moon and several stars on the kite. Jerry feels proud of the kite, and heads to the field to make it fly to the moon. Jerry attempts to fly the kite in the day with all the other boys and girls watching, but unfortunately the kite fails to fly. Jerry feels defeated and embarrassed as the village children laugh at him, and he goes to find Chubby. Together, Jerry and Chubby take the kite and proceed to go on a quest to find someone who knows why Jerry's kite will not fly. Late one night while sitting in their cozy home, a bright light falls from the sky landing in the Gaw's farm with a loud crash. Curiosity overcomes the family as they set foot outside to find a fallen star in their backyard. One line in the book reads, “Of all the places on earth a meteor could have fallen, it landed smack-dab in the middle of our yard, Gramma exclaimed.” This was such a huge deal for the residents of Mudsock Medow. There is a band, a circus, a hot air balloon, and more. The entire town gathers to celebrate the meteor. Many residents touched the meteor claiming it was magical. The photo above was taken before the trial. The balloon system is available to individuals with a lower BMI of 30-40, so it is an earlier intervention for treating obesity. The system consists of a balloon inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia necessary. The inflated balloon is about the size of a small orange. Over the next three months, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. The balloons take up space in the stomach, limiting how much a person can eat. Approximately 65 percent of patients who received the balloon system experienced clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5 percent of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the placebo-control group.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

        "context": "At midnight, a dark cloud blinded them, and Dotterine's godmother appeared. no moon present. Jerry asks the wymp if he can take them to the moon to see his kite and the wymp obliges. Before they are swallowed up by the setting of the moon, the children ride the kite back home, showing all the other children in the village that the kite really could fly. The kite, however, returns to the sky and remains a comet for the rest of time. A young boy named Jerry made the largest kite in the town with his own hands. His friend, Chubby – the woodcutter's daughter – painted a moon and several stars on the kite. Jerry feels proud of the kite, and heads to the field to make it fly to the moon. Jerry attempts to fly the kite in the day with all the other boys and girls watching, but unfortunately the kite fails to fly. Jerry feels defeated and embarrassed as the village children laugh at him, and he goes to find Chubby. Together, Jerry and Chubby take the kite and proceed to go on a quest to find someone who knows why Jerry's kite will not fly. Late one night while sitting in their cozy home, a bright light falls from the sky landing in the Gaw's farm with a loud crash. Curiosity overcomes the family as they set foot outside to find a fallen star in their backyard. One line in the book reads, “Of all the places on earth a meteor could have fallen, it landed smack-dab in the middle of our yard, Gramma exclaimed.” This was such a huge deal for the residents of Mudsock Medow. There is a band, a circus, a hot air balloon, and more. The entire town gathers to celebrate the meteor. Many residents touched the meteor claiming it was magical. The photo above was taken before the trial. The balloon system is available to individuals with a lower BMI of 30-40, so it is an earlier intervention for treating obesity. The system consists of a balloon inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia necessary. The inflated balloon is about the size of a small orange. Over the next three months, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. The balloons take up space in the stomach, limiting how much a person can eat. Approximately 65 percent of patients who received the balloon system experienced clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5 percent of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the placebo-control group.\n\n"

This effect produces a very distinctive, finely \"speckled\" appearance similar to \"salt and pepper\" hair, as well as an iridescent effect very similar to shot silk which causes the overall color to appear to shift subtly depending on the angle of the light or when the animal moves. Agouti fur is the wild type pigmentation for many domesticated mammals. For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible. Animals use colour to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to \n\n If one or more genes cannot be expressed because of another genetic factor hindering their expression, this epistasis can make it impossible even for dominant alleles on certain other gene-loci to have an effect on the phenotype. An example in dog coat genetics is the homozygosity with the allele \"e e\" on the Extension-locus making it impossible to produce any other pigment than pheomelanin. Although the allele \"e\" is a recessive allele on the extension-locus itself, the presence of two copies leverages the dominance of other coat colour genes. The only difference between hair and fur is semantics. \"'The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles,' says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. 'So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

        "context": "As a result, the overall appearance of agouti fur is usually gray or dull brown, although dull yellow is also possible. This effect produces a very distinctive, finely \"speckled\" appearance similar to \"salt and pepper\" hair, as well as an iridescent effect very similar to shot silk which causes the overall color to appear to shift subtly depending on the angle of the light or when the animal moves. Agouti fur is the wild type pigmentation for many domesticated mammals. For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible. Animals use colour to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to \n\n If one or more genes cannot be expressed because of another genetic factor hindering their expression, this epistasis can make it impossible even for dominant alleles on certain other gene-loci to have an effect on the phenotype. An example in dog coat genetics is the homozygosity with the allele \"e e\" on the Extension-locus making it impossible to produce any other pigment than pheomelanin. Although the allele \"e\" is a recessive allele on the extension-locus itself, the presence of two copies leverages the dominance of other coat colour genes. The only difference between hair and fur is semantics. \"'The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles,' says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. 'So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose.\n\n"

There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. During the formation of acetyl-CoA, each pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the release of CO2 and the production of NADH, a molecule that carries energy. The final stage, oxidative phosphorylation, occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. One of the main processes is glycolysis, which breaks down glucose into pyruvate and generates a small amount of ATP. Anaerobic respiration, also known as fermentation, can then occur in the absence of oxygen, converting pyruvate into either lactic acid or ethanol, depending on the organism. In aerobic respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and undergoes the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During this cycle, carbon molecules are oxidized, releasing energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2.

For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This is called polar night and midnight sun, respectively. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the seasons. Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. Some examples of oviparous animals include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, monotremes (egg-laying mammals), and most insects and arachnids. Oviparous animals have different reproductive methods depending on their habitat and species.

Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying the empty spaces. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by scavengers or decomposition. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology. Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering can alter the state of preservation. All of the wood's cavities will be filled with water, and the absorbed water and the remnants of the lignin will maintain the original form of the woods, meaning that the wood will only retain its original form while its underwater. When wood is found in a marine environment, it is recommended to have secured the required conditions for its conservation (water-filled pool or vessel) to extract the wood from water, to prevent the wood from dehydration. If the waterlogged wood is removed from the marine environment and exposed to air, the water will evaporate and the resulting surface tension forces of the evaporating water cause the weakened cell walls to collapse, creating considerable shrinkage and distortion\n\n collapsed and much of the site is closed to visitors because of the danger it poses to them. The artifacts found on-site are also susceptible to these agents of deterioration, mainly air, humidity, natural light, and climatic changes. While some of the damage is irreparable, the issues of funding and threat mitigation have prompted conservation and restoration specialists to reexamine and enact proper protocol in order to prevent future harm to the objects and the site itself \n\n The rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Further, in some cases, the bacterial precipitation of minerals formed a \"death mask\", ultimately leaving a positive, cast-like impression of the organism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by scavengers or decomposition. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology. Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering can alter the state of preservation. All of the wood's cavities will be filled with water, and the absorbed water and the remnants of the lignin will maintain the original form of the woods, meaning that the wood will only retain its original form while its underwater. When wood is found in a marine environment, it is recommended to have secured the required conditions for its conservation (water-filled pool or vessel) to extract the wood from water, to prevent the wood from dehydration. If the waterlogged wood is removed from the marine environment and exposed to air, the water will evaporate and the resulting surface tension forces of the evaporating water cause the weakened cell walls to collapse, creating considerable shrinkage and distortion\n\n collapsed and much of the site is closed to visitors because of the danger it poses to them. The artifacts found on-site are also susceptible to these agents of deterioration, mainly air, humidity, natural light, and climatic changes. While some of the damage is irreparable, the issues of funding and threat mitigation have prompted conservation and restoration specialists to reexamine and enact proper protocol in order to prevent future harm to the objects and the site itself \n\n The rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Further, in some cases, the bacterial precipitation of minerals formed a \"death mask\", ultimately leaving a positive, cast-like impression of the organism.\n\n"

While the term was named after the dominant portable music technology of the time, the Sony Walkman, it generically applies to all such devices and has been cited numerous times to refer to more current products such as the Apple iPod. The first presentation to the press involved young people riding bikes and skateboarding while listening to Walkmans. Sony's vice president in charge of audio products said that Walkman's achievement was that it \"provided listeners with a personal soundtrack to their lives\", allowing its users \"to make even the most boring daily activities interesting, adding a bit of personal style to everything they do.\" University of Sussex Professor Michael Bull (aka \"Professor iPod\") argues that \n\n The Walkman S Series is a series of portable media players, designed and developed by Sony, with an accent on the high quality sound. Noise cancelling function was introduced with S700 series and consolidated in later generation models, such as NWZ-S718 that came out in 2007, NWZ-S739F from 2008, NW-S746 \n\n When Sony released the first Walkmans, they featured two headphone jacks and a \"hotline\" switch.

However, there is a distinction between each, including size of the body and skeletal structure of each family, as well as distinctive characteristics in the length of the ears. A skeletal distinction can be seen in the Gaoligong Pika which lacks a supraorbital process in the skull skeletal feature and have a long and broad posterior nasal bone. Hind legs are long; the feet are densely covered with long hair. Ears are relatively short and rounded at the tips; the inner surfaces are noticeably haired.

The disorder has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, meaning only one mutated copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. About 80% of cases result from a new mutation, which originates in the father's sperm. The rest are inherited from a parent with the condition. The risk of a new mutation increases with the age of the father. In families with two affected parents, children who inherit both affected genes typically die before birth or in early infancy from breathing difficulties. The condition is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms but may be confirmed by genetic testing. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. Achondroplasia can be inherited through autosomal dominance. In situations where both parents have achondroplasia there is a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, 25% chance the child will not, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit the gene from both parents resulting in double dominance and leading to severe or lethal bone dysplasia. Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it has been theorized that sperm carrying the mutation in FGFR3 have a selective advantage over sperm with normal FGFR3. The frequency of mutations in sperm leading to achondroplasia increase in proportion to paternal age, as well as in proportion to exposure to ionizing radiation. Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 2013 indicated that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age, specifically males reproducing after 35. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Another distinct characteristic of the syndrome is thoracolumbar gibbus in infancy. Research\n, tentative evidence has found that the experimental peptide drug vosoritide increases growth velocity in those with achondroplasia. Animals \nBased on their disproportionate dwarfism, some dog breeds traditionally have been classified as \"achondroplastic\". This is the case for the dachshund, basset hound, corgi and bulldog breeds. Data from whole genome association studies in short-limbed dogs reveal a strong association of this trait with a retro-gene coding for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). Therefore, it seems unlikely that dogs and humans are achondroplastic for the same reasons. However, histological studies in some achondroplastic dog breeds have shown altered cell patterns in cartilage that are very similar to those observed in humans exhibiting achondroplasia. A similar form of achondroplasia was found in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. The now-extinct Ancon sheep was created by humans through the selective breeding of common domestic sheep with achondroplasia. The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by achondroplasia was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.

Sometimes dentists use dental fillings with different thermal expansion coefficients than tooth enamel, the fillings will expand faster than the enamel and cause pain in a person's mouth. Older people are more likely to suffer from heatstroke than younger people due to dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medication, and diseases involving the thermoregulatory system. If left untreated, heatstroke can fail to reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors may suffer long-term disability. In the event of a minor burn, or medically known as a first-degree burn injury, the outer layer of the skin, or the epidermis, is damaged. Burned individuals might treat the wound simply by pouring cold water over the hurt area. However, the damage is usually superficial and may leave little more than a minor scar. However, in terms of more serious burn injuries, such as those caused by second-degree or third-degree burns, skin layers beneath the epidermis are affected. It is also possible that bone or organ tissues can be impacted as well, leading to serious and potentially-fatal circumstances. Laboratories and chemical factories are the most common places for such incidents to occur, though household chemicals can be potent enough as well. In most chemical burns, the skin is dissolved upon contact and even vigorous washing may not rid the affected areas of dangerous chemicals, causing further damage. Highly dangerous, electricity flows through the body in search of the easiest path of resistance towards a ground. Depending on the severity and location of the burn, surgeons may conduct a skin graft operation, which moves healthy skin to the affected area. Alternatively, medical advances have allowed for new treatments such as the use of artificial skin. Even minor burns can hinder or prevent the skin from retaining its elasticity. Retain their sense of feeling: Because burns tend to destroy nerve endings in victims, the skin may lose some or all sense of feeling, including touch and temperature. Depending on the size and location of the burn, this can prevent the body from being able to adequately regulate its temperature, making individuals far more susceptible to hyperthermia or hypothermia (dangerously high or low body temperature). Endure hot weather: Burned skin loses its natural ability to protect the individual from sun damage and will need to be protected from the elements. Prevent infection: Burned skin not only loses its ability to protect an individual from infection, it makes it far more likely as bacteria and other pathogens pool around dead skin. This necessitates new healthy skin to be grafted to the area else the risk of infection remains excessively high. Medical treatment can be extensive and painful, often requiring multiple skin graft operations. Kamran Yadidi Law Group’s professional team has significant experience with cases that relate to burn injuries. The veteran attorneys at Kamran Yadidi Law Group have worked on over 10,000 personal injury cases, including numerous cases where clients have unfairly been subjected to burn injuries. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium. In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

However, in terms of more serious burn injuries, such as those caused by second-degree or third-degree burns, skin layers beneath the epidermis are affected. It is also possible that bone or organ tissues can be impacted as well, leading to serious and potentially-fatal circumstances. Laboratories and chemical factories are the most common places for such incidents to occur, though household chemicals can be potent enough as well. In most chemical burns, the skin is dissolved upon contact and even vigorous washing may not rid the affected areas of dangerous chemicals, causing further damage. Highly dangerous, electricity flows through the body in search of the easiest path of resistance towards a ground. Depending on the severity and location of the burn, surgeons may conduct a skin graft operation, which moves healthy skin to the affected area. Alternatively, medical advances have allowed for new treatments such as the use of artificial skin. Even minor burns can hinder or prevent the skin from retaining its elasticity. Retain their sense of feeling: Because burns tend to destroy nerve endings in victims, the skin may lose some or all sense of feeling, including touch and temperature. Depending on the size and location of the burn, this can prevent the body from being able to adequately regulate its temperature, making individuals far more susceptible to hyperthermia or hypothermia (dangerously high or low body temperature). Endure hot weather: Burned skin loses its natural ability to protect the individual from sun damage and will need to be protected from the elements. Prevent infection: Burned skin not only loses its ability to protect an individual from infection, it makes it far more likely as bacteria and other pathogens pool around dead skin. This necessitates new healthy skin to be grafted to the area else the risk of infection remains excessively high. Medical treatment can be extensive and painful, often requiring multiple skin graft operations. Kamran Yadidi Law Group’s professional team has significant experience with cases that relate to burn injuries. The veteran attorneys at Kamran Yadidi Law Group have worked on over 10,000 personal injury cases, including numerous cases where clients have unfairly been subjected to burn injuries. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium. In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers.\n\n"

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used for years on humans, and it's now a new and promising way to treat anemia in dogs, too. HBOT may give our dogs the precious time they need for a veterinarian to treat the underlying causes of their anemia. A dog with a severe injury may become anemic due to blood loss, while another may have hemolytic anemia, a condition where red blood cells are being destroyed inside the body. The dog enters a chamber about the size of a small couch and lies down for one to two hours. During that time, the chamber is filled with up to three times the amount of oxygen normally found in the air. The increased oxygen in the air makes it easier for your dog's body to absorb this essential gas, which has a number of medical benefits. More than 30 to 40 percent blood loss can lead to shock and death in your pet if she's not quickly given a blood transfusion. HBOT therapy can ensure she continues getting enough oxygen for the precious time it takes to obtain and type the blood for transfusion. Vets are optimistic about the potential uses for HBOT in treating our beloved pets. HBOT may be useful in delivering crucial oxygen to blocked tissues in animals with sepsis infections, decreasing swelling from snakebites, preventing tissue death, preventing brain damage in dogs that have suffered head trauma or been resuscitated through CPR, speeding up the healing of large or difficult wounds, and many other applications. While the field of study is relatively new, results show that oxygen therapy has vast potential in treating our pets. Timely intervention to restore oxygen supply is crucial to prevent these consequences. It's important to ensure that patients receive sufficient oxygen in critical situations, such as prior to intubation, to meet their oxygen demand during potentially dangerous periods. This is typically achieved by enriching the lungs' storage space with pure oxygen through various means, such as the use of oxygen applicators and closed systems to deliver oxygen. A healthcare professional can evaluate your condition, provide appropriate treatment, and ensure your oxygen levels are restored to normal. If left untreated, the condition can lead to cataracts, increasing weakness in the legs (neuropathy), malnutrition, ketoacidosis, dehydration, and death.

Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings. In common language usage, \"fruit\" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term \"fruit\" also includes many structures that are not commonly called \"fruits\", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.\n\n"

A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth. When there is limited bioavailable P in the soil, plants show extensive abiotic stress phenotype such as short primary roots and more lateral roots and root hairs to make more surface available for Pi absorption, exudation of organic acids and phosphatase to release Pi from complex P containing molecules and make it available for growing plants' organs. Different species of houseplants require different soil moisture levels. Most plants can not withstand their roots sitting in water and will often lead to root rot. Different plants require different amounts of light, for different durations. Plants require soil minerals, mainly nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. The primary examples are high temperature and drought which was responsible for the changes in plant development and for the loss of the maize crops, respectively.

Technically speaking, a cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, sinuses, and bronchial tubes. When confronted with the viral invaders, the nose and throat release chemicals to stoke up the immune system. The affected cells produce prostaglandins, which stimulate inflammation and lure the infection-fighting white blood cells. The body temperature rises to boost the immune response and more nasal mucus is produced to trap and wash away viral particles. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of this disease include headache, neck pain, drowsiness, nausea, and fever. If caused by the West Nile virus, it may be lethal to humans, as well as birds and horses. There is much variation in the sensitivity to cold experienced by different people, with some putting on many layers of clothing while others in the same environment feel comfortable in one layer. Cold sensitivity may be a symptom of hypothyroidism, anemia, fibromyalgia or vasoconstriction. There are other conditions that may cause a cold intolerance, including low body weight, high body temperature and low blood pressure. There may also be differences in people in the expression of uncoupling proteins, thus affecting their amount of thermogenesis. Psychology may also play a factor in perceived temperature. The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection. Other\nHerd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself. Pathophysiology\n\nThe symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. Diagnosis\nThe distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Management\n\nTreatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect. It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful. In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. Antibiotics and antivirals\nAntibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. Vitamins C and D\n\nVitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name \"cold\" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance.

There is much variation in the sensitivity to cold experienced by different people, with some putting on many layers of clothing while others in the same environment feel comfortable in one layer. Cold sensitivity may be a symptom of hypothyroidism, anemia, fibromyalgia or vasoconstriction. There are other conditions that may cause a cold intolerance, including low body weight, high body temperature and low blood pressure. There may also be differences in people in the expression of uncoupling proteins, thus affecting their amount of thermogenesis. Psychology may also play a factor in perceived temperature. The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection. Other\nHerd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself. Pathophysiology\n\nThe symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. Diagnosis\nThe distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. It is unclear if zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold. Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration. Management\n\nTreatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect. It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful. In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. Some advise to avoid physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. Antibiotics and antivirals\nAntibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. Vitamins C and D\n\nVitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name \"cold\" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance.

A microscope produces a magnified image of an otherwise microscopic object for viewing through the human eye.

Firstly, the rigidity of our bones allows them to protect our internal organs from damage. For example, the rib cage and the skull protect our lungs and brain, respectively. Moreover, the skeletal frame provides a structural framework, giving the body a supportive structure for soft tissues and shaping the body. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would simply collapse. Furthermore, the bone marrow found within the bones is responsible for the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets through a process called hematopoiesis. In summary, the skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs through its rigidity, attachment points for muscles and ligaments, structural framework, and mineral storage capabilities. The main functions of the skeletal system are to provide support, protect internal organs, and allow for movement. Another important function of the skeletal system is to protect vital internal organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement. The bones, joints, and muscles work together to allow for various types of movement, such as walking, running, and grasping objects. The bones act as levers, while the joints provide flexibility and allow for smooth movement. In summary, the skeletal system provides support, protects internal organs, and enables movement in the body. The main functions of the skeletal system in the human body are as follows:\n\n1. Support: The skeletal system provides structural support and framework for the body. Protection: The bones of the skeleton protect vital organs of the body. For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribcage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. These blood cells are essential for the transportation of oxygen, fighting infections, and blood clotting, respectively. Movement and Locomotion: The skeletal system, along with muscles and joints, enables movement and locomotion, allowing us to walk, run, jump, and perform other activities. It is important to note that the skeletal system is composed of 206 bones in an adult human body, with each bone serving different functions and contributing to the overall functioning of the system. ; Integumentary system: skin, hair, fat, and nails. ; Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question.

Moreover, the skeletal frame provides a structural framework, giving the body a supportive structure for soft tissues and shaping the body. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would simply collapse. Furthermore, the bone marrow found within the bones is responsible for the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets through a process called hematopoiesis. In summary, the skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs through its rigidity, attachment points for muscles and ligaments, structural framework, and mineral storage capabilities. The main functions of the skeletal system are to provide support, protect internal organs, and allow for movement. Another important function of the skeletal system is to protect vital internal organs. For example, the skull protects the brain, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement. The bones, joints, and muscles work together to allow for various types of movement, such as walking, running, and grasping objects. The bones act as levers, while the joints provide flexibility and allow for smooth movement. In summary, the skeletal system provides support, protects internal organs, and enables movement in the body. The main functions of the skeletal system in the human body are as follows:\n\n1. Support: The skeletal system provides structural support and framework for the body. Protection: The bones of the skeleton protect vital organs of the body. For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribcage protects the heart and lungs, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord. These blood cells are essential for the transportation of oxygen, fighting infections, and blood clotting, respectively. Movement and Locomotion: The skeletal system, along with muscles and joints, enables movement and locomotion, allowing us to walk, run, jump, and perform other activities. It is important to note that the skeletal system is composed of 206 bones in an adult human body, with each bone serving different functions and contributing to the overall functioning of the system. ; Integumentary system: skin, hair, fat, and nails. ; Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\n"

Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources. wrote: \"yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile.

On a trip to France a few years ago, I was shocked to see pornography openly displayed on the streets in large advertisements.

Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer. UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin.It can even reduce skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, \n\n A childless woman tells the Sun that if she could only have a child, the Sun could take the child when she was twelve. When Maroula is twelve, a fine gentlemen meets her while she is gathering herbs and tells her to remind her mother of her promise. In Megas's variant, this happens twice; the first, the mother instructs Maroula to tell the Sun that she forgot; the second, the Sun has her put an apple in her headdress to remind her by falling out in the evening; the mother keeps her a long time, and finally sends her \n\nyOU DON'T have to get burned to increase the risk of skin cancer. So if you store all your sunscreen in your beach bag, do yourself a favor and get an extra tube for when you drive to the mall or walk the dog. \"The damage caused by the sun is incremental,\" says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., and author of Total Skin. In other words, your risk increases one sunny (or cloudy) day at a time. Sunlight induces skin cancer in several ways, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Melanoma (4 percent) is the most dangerous kind of skin cancer; it can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream and the lymph system. Asymmetry Skin cancers often have irregular shapes. Staying out of the sun is by far the most effective way to prevent skin cancer. Using sunscreen is the next-best strategy, and you should never wander far from your trusty bottle of SPF 30. (The number refers to the level of sun protection factor against UVB radiation.) \"Just like you brush your teeth every day, you should use sunscreen every day,\" advises dermatologist Joshua Fox, M.D., director of Advanced Dermatology P.C. in New York and a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology \"Even on a cloudy day, up to 80 percent of the sun's rays get through.\" Water reflects 20 percent of the sun's rays, while sand and snow boost them by 80 percent. Sunscreen and sunblock are not the same. In sunscreens, chemicals like benzophenones, cinnamates, salicylates, and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a compound linked to allergic reactions in some people) prevent sun damage by chemically absorbing radiation before it reaches the skin. Sunblocks contain ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that lie on top of the skin and physically obstruct UVA and UVB radiation. Sunblocks with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also \"photo-stable,\" which means they do not change in the presence of light; many products combine the two agents, such as Jason Family Block, SkinCeuticals Physical UV Defense, and Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion. Don't spend a fortune for sun protection, but choose something with an appealing texture; otherwise you'll never use it. If you run out of sunscreen, don't presume that throwing on a shirt will defend you from the sun. \"The average white T-shirt has an SPF of four to six,\" notes Leffell. Loosely woven garments that are light in color, thin, or stretchy (which describes most warm-weather fabrics) offer little safety. \"Very fair people and those who have had skin cancer should wear broad-brimmed hats and use sun-protective clothing,\" Leffell advises. It might even offer protection against diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, says Boston University School of Medicine professor Michael Holick, M.D., Ph.D., author of The UV Advantage. Holick advises people to expose their arms and legs to five to 10 minutes of sunshine between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (depending on season, skin type, and latitude) two or three days a week. But other dermatologists disagree, especially since you can get vitamin D through supplements. Fox concurs: \"I think it's better to wear sunscreen every day.\" Other ways to guard your delicate lids include carefully applying sunscreen around the area — a sunblock stick makes this easier to do safely — and wearing a hat with a brim that is at feast 3 to 4 inches wide. Protect your kisser with sun-blocking lip balms like Almay Pure Tints Protective Lip Care or C.O. Nearly 30 million Americans visit indoor tanning salons each year, and many of them believe what they're doing carries no danger. \"Indoor tanning is simply not safe,\" says James M. Spencer, M.D., a board member of the Skin Cancer Foundation. In a large-scale Scandinavian study, tanning-bed use was associated with a 55 percent increase in melanoma risk, especially in participants between the ages of 20 and 29. \"We know that tanning-parlor radiation definitely causes skin cancer,\" says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine. Since the damaging effects accumulate over time, indoor tanning is particularly dangerous during the teenage years. \"In my experience, any woman in her 20s who has a skin cancer most likely says she used tanning parlors,\" Leffell reports.

Most women who wear it believe they are following God’s injunction and not their husband’s. On a trip to France a few years ago, I was shocked to see pornography openly displayed on the streets in large advertisements. How odd that to unveil a woman for all to gape at is civilized, but for her to cover up to ward off gazes is a crime...While the French Prime Minister sees no problem with exposing in public places a woman’s glorious nakedness, he is oddly and quite rabidly disturbed by allowing others to cover it \n\n Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer. UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin.It can even reduce skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, \n\n A childless woman tells the Sun that if she could only have a child, the Sun could take the child when she was twelve. When Maroula is twelve, a fine gentlemen meets her while she is gathering herbs and tells her to remind her mother of her promise. In Megas's variant, this happens twice; the first, the mother instructs Maroula to tell the Sun that she forgot; the second, the Sun has her put an apple in her headdress to remind her by falling out in the evening; the mother keeps her a long time, and finally sends her \n\nyOU DON'T have to get burned to increase the risk of skin cancer. So if you store all your sunscreen in your beach bag, do yourself a favor and get an extra tube for when you drive to the mall or walk the dog. \"The damage caused by the sun is incremental,\" says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., and author of Total Skin. In other words, your risk increases one sunny (or cloudy) day at a time. Sunlight induces skin cancer in several ways, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Melanoma (4 percent) is the most dangerous kind of skin cancer; it can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream and the lymph system. Asymmetry Skin cancers often have irregular shapes. Staying out of the sun is by far the most effective way to prevent skin cancer. Using sunscreen is the next-best strategy, and you should never wander far from your trusty bottle of SPF 30. (The number refers to the level of sun protection factor against UVB radiation.) \"Just like you brush your teeth every day, you should use sunscreen every day,\" advises dermatologist Joshua Fox, M.D., director of Advanced Dermatology P.C. in New York and a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology \"Even on a cloudy day, up to 80 percent of the sun's rays get through.\" Water reflects 20 percent of the sun's rays, while sand and snow boost them by 80 percent. Sunscreen and sunblock are not the same. In sunscreens, chemicals like benzophenones, cinnamates, salicylates, and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a compound linked to allergic reactions in some people) prevent sun damage by chemically absorbing radiation before it reaches the skin. Sunblocks contain ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that lie on top of the skin and physically obstruct UVA and UVB radiation. Sunblocks with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also \"photo-stable,\" which means they do not change in the presence of light; many products combine the two agents, such as Jason Family Block, SkinCeuticals Physical UV Defense, and Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion. Don't spend a fortune for sun protection, but choose something with an appealing texture; otherwise you'll never use it. If you run out of sunscreen, don't presume that throwing on a shirt will defend you from the sun. \"The average white T-shirt has an SPF of four to six,\" notes Leffell. Loosely woven garments that are light in color, thin, or stretchy (which describes most warm-weather fabrics) offer little safety. \"Very fair people and those who have had skin cancer should wear broad-brimmed hats and use sun-protective clothing,\" Leffell advises. It might even offer protection against diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, says Boston University School of Medicine professor Michael Holick, M.D., Ph.D., author of The UV Advantage. Holick advises people to expose their arms and legs to five to 10 minutes of sunshine between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (depending on season, skin type, and latitude) two or three days a week. But other dermatologists disagree, especially since you can get vitamin D through supplements. Fox concurs: \"I think it's better to wear sunscreen every day.\" Other ways to guard your delicate lids include carefully applying sunscreen around the area — a sunblock stick makes this easier to do safely — and wearing a hat with a brim that is at feast 3 to 4 inches wide. Protect your kisser with sun-blocking lip balms like Almay Pure Tints Protective Lip Care or C.O. Nearly 30 million Americans visit indoor tanning salons each year, and many of them believe what they're doing carries no danger. \"Indoor tanning is simply not safe,\" says James M. Spencer, M.D., a board member of the Skin Cancer Foundation. In a large-scale Scandinavian study, tanning-bed use was associated with a 55 percent increase in melanoma risk, especially in participants between the ages of 20 and 29. \"We know that tanning-parlor radiation definitely causes skin cancer,\" says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine. Since the damaging effects accumulate over time, indoor tanning is particularly dangerous during the teenage years. \"In my experience, any woman in her 20s who has a skin cancer most likely says she used tanning parlors,\" Leffell reports. But protective strategies can keep those cancerous rays at bay.\n\n"
