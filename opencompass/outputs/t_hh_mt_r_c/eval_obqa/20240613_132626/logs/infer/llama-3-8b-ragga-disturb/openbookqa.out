You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

["The best way to guess a baby's eye color is by looking at the genealogy records of their family. This is because eye color is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the genes that determine eye color are passed down from generation to generation. By examining the eye colors of the baby's parents, grandparents, and other close relatives, it's possible to make an educated guess about what the baby's eye color might be. While the surroundings and diet of the baby may have some impact on eye color, these factors are generally not significant enough to significantly alter the baby's eye color. Ultimately, the best way to determine a baby's eye color is to wait and see.", 'What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?\nA.
