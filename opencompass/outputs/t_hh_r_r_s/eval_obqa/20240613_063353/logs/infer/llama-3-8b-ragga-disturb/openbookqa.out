["The best way to guess a baby's eye color is by looking at the genealogy records of their family. This is because eye color is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the genes that determine eye color are passed down from generation to generation. By examining the eye colors of the baby's parents, grandparents, and other close relatives, it's possible to make an educated guess about what the baby's eye color might be. While the surroundings and diet of the baby may have some impact on eye color, these factors are generally not significant enough to significantly alter the baby's eye color. Ultimately, the best way to determine a baby's eye color is to wait and see.", 'What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?What is the best way to guess a babies eye color?\nA.

  Table 2 is simplified example from Mendelian genetics involving controlled breeding of flowers. It demonstrates the outcome when flowers of different colors are crossed with each other. The dominant color gene (Red) decides the outcome when crossed with recessive color gene (yellow) producing a hybrid (Red*) flower. If either parent possesses the dominant gene, the table shows the outcome that results.

  The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent

Across the world, screening programs are important for identifying children who have a need for spectacles but either do not wear any or have the wrong prescription. Children need the following basic visual skills for learning:

  The simplest and easiest way to detect trisomy 8 is by a Karyotype, a photograph representing all chromosomes of a cell in an orderly manner. Amniocentesis is also a technique for diagnosis. Samples from the Amniotic Liquid is taken from a fetus, cultured, then analyzed by a karyotype. If the photograph shows 3 copies of chromosome 8 instead of 2, then the individual has trisomy 8.

  trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis... people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black." Neitz said: "Our visual system is supposed to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance... but I've studied individual differences in colour vision for 30 years, and this is one of the biggest individual differences I've ever seen." Similar theories have been expounded by the University of Liverpool's Paul Knox, who stated that

  is still pregnant from a blood draw. DNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage. In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as "chimeras", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.

  "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials. The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

 Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid).Acquired nystagmus can also occur with _Graves' disease_ , an overactive thyroid (see **Protruding Eyes** , above), as well as several inner ear disorders. And it can be a very early warning sign of a number of neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, a brain tumor, or even a stroke. A blow to the head can sometimes cause nystagmus, in which case it may be a warning sign of a brain injury. **STOP SIGN**

  Children should be tested for color blindness as early as possible. Since many toys and preschool activities are color dependent, teachers should be alerted if a child is color-blind. Otherwise they may mistakenly think that the child has a language or other problem. Early detection is also important for safety. A child who is color-blind may not be able to tell the difference between red and green traffic lights. ### **CROSSED EYES**

**_Q:_** _I've heard that babies with crossed eyes often grow out of it. Is that true?_

**_A:_** That may be true depending on how young—or old—a baby is when the crossed eyes are first sighted. Eye movement disorders, medically referred to as _strabismus_ , are very common in newborns. The majority of these babies have crossed eyes—that is, one eye that turns slightly inward. This condition is medically known as _esotropia_. When it occurs in infancy, babies usually outgrow it by 3 months. **SIGNIFICANT FACT**

  There's a condition called _pseudostrabismus_ , in which a baby's eyes look crossed but aren't. It's actually an optical illusion, which can occur when a baby has closely set eyes, a flat nasal bridge, asymmetrical eyelids, or a prominent _epicanthal fold_ (the skin fold of the upper eyelid). Although any baby can have a prominent epicanthal fold, they are most commonly seen in Asian babies.When an older baby develops crossed eyes, usually between 2 and 4 months of age, it's referred to as _infantile_ or _congenital esotropia_.Babies do _not_ outgrow this form of esotropia, which may be inherited.Eye-muscle surgery is often recommended, but even then, the condition may recur later in childhood or adulthood, requiring further surgery.

  Babies' eyes—especially light-colored eyes—are very sun-sensitive.In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2).Albinism is a rare genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce an adequate amount of melanin, the substance responsible for eye, skin, and hair color.Today, many Greeks—as well as other southern Europeans and Middle Easterners—still carry these blue amulets. However, if a baby has different-colored eyes as well as a streak of white hair or a white forelock, it can signal _Waardenburg syndrome_ (see Chapter 2), a rare, potentially serious, genetic condition. Children with this disorder often suffer from vision problems and deafness. Although there's no cure, vision and hearing problems can usually be treated, allowing the children to lead normal lives. Heterochromia can be a sign of several other congenital, but not inherited, conditions, including _Duane syndrome_ , an eye-movement disorder that sometimes also affects a child's vision (See **An Up-Cast Eye** , below) and congenital _Horner's syndrome_ , a nerve disorder. Other common signs of Horner's include two different-sized pupils and a droopy eyelid. (See **Mismatched Pupils** and **Droopy Eyes** , below.) Facial sweating on the affected side is sometimes absent. **SIGN OF THE TIMES**

  Aristotle, Alexander the Great, and Louis Pasteur were reported to have two different-colored eyes. Some modern-day celebrities—Including Kate Bosworth, Jane Seymour, Kiefer Sutherland, and Christopher Walken—do as well. ### **PALE OR PINK EYES**

**_Q:_** _My 2-month-old niece, who has very pale blue eyes, was diagnosed with albinism. Don't albinos have pink eyes? If she is an albino, will her vision be affected?_

**_A:_** While most people with albinism do have pink eyes, some have very light blue or gray eyes. Albinism is a rare genetic disorder in which the body doesn't produce an adequate amount of melanin, the substance responsible for eye, skin, and hair color. In addition to pink or pale eyes, babies and children with this condition often have very fair skin and white or yellowish hair (see Chapter 2). **STOP SIGN**

More recently, scientists have found that in certain ethnic groups, most notably the Hopi Indians in the United States, the incidence of albinism and deafness is exceedingly high, affecting 1 in 200 people. Most children with albinism do suffer from eye problems such as poor vision, light sensitivity, crossed eyes, and _nystagmus_ , which is rapid, uncontrollable back-and-forth or up-and-down eye movements (see **Unusual Eye Movements and Positions** , below). In some cases, albinism is also associated with deafness. With the exception of these eye problems, most albinos are healthy. They do, however, have to be very careful in the sun because they're at increased risk for serious sunburn and, as a result, skin cancer. There is no cure for albinism; treatment focuses on correcting a child's vision and other eye problems. ### **RED EYES**

However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as "chimeras", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.
 5 -10.13891  The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent

["The hypothesis that the ice caps will completely melt if global warming continues is based on scientific evidence and research. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the Arctic sea ice has been declining at a rate of 12.8 percent per decade since 1979. This trend is expected to continue, and by the end of the century, the Arctic could be ice-free during summer months.

   Spherical Earth or Earth's curvature refers to the approximation of figure of the Earth as a sphere. The earliest documented mention of the concept dates from around the 5th century BC, when it appears in the writings of Greek philosophers. In the 3rd century BC, Hellenistic astronomy established the roughly spherical shape of Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth's circumference. This knowledge was gradually adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. A practical demonstration of Earth's sphericity was achieved by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano's circumnavigation (1519–1522). The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a flat Earth: In early Mesopotamian mythology, the world was portrayed as a flat

  The laws of gravity, chemistry, and physics that explain the formation and rounding of Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks. From these laws, the amount of mass Earth contains is known, as is the fact that a non-spherical planet the size of Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity. A disk the size of Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape. On a disk strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disk, contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would cause major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk). Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth conjecturists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards. Such a conjecture would also leave open for explanation the tides seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

  Climate change is defined as the long term change in weather patterns allowing for Earth's climate to change. Evidence for the Earth's cycle between hothouse and icehouse climates can be found using sedimentation and greenhouse gas data. Global Warming is the scientific theory that humans are raising the Earth's temperature primarily through increasingly burning fossil fuels causing the Earth to trap greenhouse gases which raises the Earth's temperature. Both climate change and global warming would further cause ocean: temperature levels, acidity and greenhouse gas levels to rise. In turn, this would cause many of the existing flora and fauna to perish or migrate elsewhere. For example, scientists predict that global warming will decrease the abundance of phytoplankton (a keystone

   The simplest model for the shape of the entire Earth is a sphere. The Earth's radius is the distance from Earth's center to its surface, about 6371 km. While "radius" normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the Earth deviates from spherical by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term "the radius of the Earth". The concept of a spherical Earth dates back to around the 6th century BC, but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century BC. The first scientific estimation of the radius of the Earth was given

  Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around Earth in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier. (See Circumnavigation, Arctic exploration, and History of Antarctica.) Some flat Earth conjectures that propose that Earth is a north-pole-centered disk, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges. This disk model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disk in a circle. (East-west paths form a circle in both disk and spherical geometry.) It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it would

  Climate change, which is a phenomenon also known as the greenhouse effect, is the warming that occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping. The North American Arctic is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change compared to other regions. Climate change has caused the temperature in the region to rise, extreme weather events, changing wildlife populations and habitats, and sea ice to melt resulting in rising sea levels. In November 2016, the daily average temperature was 2.22 °C (36 °F) lower than usual and sea ice cover was less than the previous recorded low in November 2012. Ice sheets have been observed to form later, separate earlier, and rapidly decline in age, thickness distribution and regional

 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force.
For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death.
Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world.
"We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S.
Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection.
Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention."
The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years.
Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England.
Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly.
"Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis .
The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone."
"For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah."
Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
"A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash."
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two.
The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two."
While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera.
The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence.
The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996.
"There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive.
"For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen."
These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root.
Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.
Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path.
If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth.
Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds.
"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light.
"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now.
In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water.
The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space.
The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now.
All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago?
To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years.
In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in this region is indicative that this area may have once been an ocean. The agency’s findings using subsurface radar are not surprising but they have added to the existing data gathered from images, atmospheric measurements and mineralogical study of the planet which already previously pinpointed the northern plains to be the site of ancient Martian shorelines.
2012 STUDY ON MARTIAN METEORITES BY MCCUBBIN ET AL.
Within that same year, planetary scientist Francis McCubbin of the University Of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues published a study on Martian meteorites containing hydrated minerals which allowed them to estimate how much water exists today in the Martian mantle. The authors of the study determined that Mars has enough water in its mantle to submerge the planet for as deep as 200 to 1000 meters. This means the planet is currently shrouding around 70 to 300 parts per million of liquid water somewhere beneath its surface.
Then there’s also the study published by the international journal Icarus in 2014 which revealed that a team of geologists found evidence of a vast ancient underground ocean located beneath the surface of Aram Chaos, one of the impact craters on Mars. Around 2.5 billion years ago, about 93,000 cubic kilometers of water supposedly broke through and flooded the surface after the lake ice – which was concealed underground – melted and its ceiling suddenly collapsed.
Here’s an idea how much water reached the Martian surface at the time: they say it is equivalent to around 80% of the free-flowing fresh water that exists on our own planet today.
In 2015, researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, led by planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva, developed infrared maps of water isotopes on Mars which showed the distribution of atmospheric water on the planet - H2O and its deuterated form, HDO. In doing so, they were able to estimate how much liquid water Mars used to have. According to their findings, Mars may have once had enough water to cover up to 20 percent or about a fifth of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. They also suggested that the planet could still contain some subterranean water reservoirs and that the key to finding them lies in refining the infrared maps they had developed.
That same year, another study revealed that NASA’s Curiosity rover – which landed on Mars’s Gale Crater back in 2012 – managed to measure estimates of the concentration of subterranean water on the planet. The new measurements suggested that the soil in Mars is moist with liquid brine. The presence of this liquid brine is supposedly caused by the perchlorate salts found in the soil as it is known to reduce the freezing point of water. The salt is the one responsible for absorbing the water vapor from the atmosphere which then precipitated under the surface. The researchers considered this find as an indirect evidence of transient liquid water on the planet though they insist that the presence of liquid brine is not enough to deem Mars equipped to support terrestrial organisms.
A similar finding was reached that same year by examining the data and images gathered from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO. At the time, the researchers believed that the dark streaks found on Martian craters is actually Martian soil being dampened by briny water, which may have been enough to allow microbial life to thrive on the planet. However, authors of a later study argued against the hypothesis that there is liquid water on the Martina surface, suggesting instead that the dark streaks captured by the MRO’s powerful camera were just grains of sand and dust that occasionally slipped downhill.
An underground layer of water ice was also detected within the planet’s Utopia Planitia region. Researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter again, particularly its ground-penetrating Shallow Radar instrument, which is also referred to as SHARAD. After they analyzed the data provided by the high-powered radar, they discovered a massive deposit of water ice in the area that is much bigger than the State of Mexico. This subterranean ice deposit runs deep – between an estimated thickness of 260 feet to around 560 feet. Fifty to eight-five percent of the deposit is made of ice while the rest is made up of dust and rock particles.
The water ice deposit in Utopia Planitia managed to elude the danger of being vaporized by the planet’s hostile atmosphere because of the thick soil that successfully separated the two. Estimates of the soil’s thickness in this region range between 3 to 33 feet.
Another compelling evidence that supports the theory that an ancient underground ocean is hidden beneath the Red Planet’s surface comes from the reanalyzed data from NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft which has been orbiting the planet since 2001. Researchers found patches of water ice in regions at surprisingly lower latitudes. Should this equatorial ice eventually melt and reach the surface, it is presumed that it would very likely result to the formation of a more accommodating environment that could be perfect for the survival and growth of microbial life.
Despite the vast amount of research that has gone into finding water and life on Mars, many of the missing pieces needed to complete the entire picture of what happened to this unique Red Planet and what remains there now have yet to be found. However, it is safe to say that we know more about our neighbor planet now more than we did before, and most of the information we have learned about Mars has only strengthened our scientific community’s conviction that liquid water once filled a sizeable portion of the planet’s surface and may still be lurking beneath its porous subterranean rocks.
Since the first Apollo mission in 1969, astronauts have since reported strange flashes of light on the surface of the moon that seems to come out of nowhere.
Many scientists have made speculations about the cause and possible origins of the flashing lights but none of them have ever come close to being a definitive explanation.
However, there are some theories that may hold a little weight in explaining the occurrence of these strange flashes. So, in today’s video we are exploring some of the theories as we try to figure out these mysterious flashes of light on the surface of the moon.
As mentioned earlier, astronauts since the first moon landing by Apollo 11 have reported sighting s of flashing lights on the moon’s surface. What’s strange about it is that they have reported these flashes even when their eyes are closed.
In one documentary, the lights were allegedly seen by several of the Apollo astronauts as they approached the moon.
Astronauts who have encountered the lights would describe it as white flashes but there are others that have reported back after encountering lights in different colours such as blue and yellow; and in almost all instances, after they have come back home to earth, astronauts who have come across these lights would still see these flashes under various lighting conditions.
A theory explains why these astronauts are seeing what they were seeing and it all points towards cosmic rays.
Defined as a “highly energetic atomic nucleus or particle that travels through space at a speed close to that of light”, these rays – and how they interacted with the human optic nerve – are responsible for the eyes seeing strange lights in varying degrees of colours depending on how much radiation from cosmic rays the optic nerve has absorbed.
To test this theory, engineers put together an experiment involving a black box that can be worn as a helmet. The box would then have sensors that would detect the presence of cosmic rays.
Astronaut Charles Duke wore the helmet on his next mission and reported back seeing clusters of lights and white streaks the same time the box detected the presence of cosmic rays in his immediate environment.
Another theory explaining the flashes of lights is the existence of cold spots on the moon’s surface. These cold spots have been discovered to have layers of thin ice and frost that, when lights from the sun reflects on it, creates flashing or blinking that may trick the eye into believing that the lights are coming from the moon itself.
Revealed from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO, the data brought back helped researches identify certain areas on the moon’s south pole that are cold enough to have frost formations. These formations are suspected to be located in craters where temperatures can drop to negative 163 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore, the research suggests that the icy deposits on the moon appear to be thin and in patches and may be mixed in with the moon’s soil and dust. Also, the evidence of frost suggests that the moon may either have water deposits for millions of years or may have been brought by colliding asteroids which may also explain how water was delivered on the surface of the earth.
Although, another hypothesis points out that hydrogen may have been present in a different form on the surface of the moon – but the idea that the moon could store water ice is still difficult to confirm and is being looked into for over 50 years now and since 2009 understanding the main composition of these icy deposits are still being studied and remains one of the main goals of the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter.
This is a controversial area of study that mainly involves looking into bright sparks on the moon’s surface, discolourations, or misty patches of lunar fog.
Transient Lunar Phenomenon was a term created by Sir Patrick Moore in 1968 in order to give the sightings credence in the scientific community. However, these sightings have existed for more than a millennium according to studies on the subject.
One of the early records of this phenomenon was traced back to a mistake made in the 16th Century when early astronomers spotted a “daytime star” near the moon but was later on discovered to be the planet Venus.
Fast forward to 1969 to a time when astronomy has made larger strides since the 16th Century; during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong remarked that there was “an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area” of the moon.
After several studies conducted by NASA after the Apollo 11 mission, various photographs and images have been taken and produced in order to find the root cause of the strange lights.
Unfortunately, unlike the sudden flashes caused by asteroids on impact, the illumination on the surface of the moon appears to be much more subtle and harder to trace.
In a study conducted by the British Astronomical Association led by Jill Scrambler, the amount of data used between 1700 and 2010 were impressive and the studies conducted on each of them were extremely thorough as each data from different observers – from amateur to seasoned astronomers – were weighed for reliability.
The result was that at least 2% of the TLP sightings were considered “definitive” and unambiguous”. To put it simply: there really is something happening on the surface of the moon, we just aren’t sure what it is. To this very day, researchers are not clear as to what the real cause of TLPs is.
Fortunately for scientists and astronomers continuing to conduct their research on the phenomenon, a new spacecraft called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer was launched in the summer of 2013 to better explore the surface of the moon and provide clearer explanations about these mysterious illuminations and flashing lights.
SYDNEY (AP) — One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I.
No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week.
While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.
"It was the first loss for the RAN and the first Allied submarine loss in World War I — a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies," Payne said in a statement.
The AE1 made final contact with an Australian ship at 2:30 p.m. the day it disappeared. Mystified villagers on a nearby island at the time spoke of seeing a "monster" or "devil fish" that appeared and quickly disappeared into the water.
For years, the United States government has always tried to maintain a safe and somewhat skeptical position when it concerns the possibility of alien life and likelihood that extraterrestrial beings may try to visit our planet or have already succeeded in doing so. Whenever footage or information on unexpected sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs are released and made known to the public, government institutions are quick to refute the possibility that the origins of these aerial objects are not of this world. Instead, they offer explanations that they deem more plausible, completely veering the public’s attention and curiosity from topics they feel are best left undiscussed. Perhaps this is to prevent the public from descending into chaos because of their misguided fears. Or, perhaps it is to spare the rest of us from having to deal with difficult truths while those in the government covertly act with our best interests supposedly always in mind.
Usually, it’s the former. Most of the time, our excessively creative imaginations and our tendency to get ahead of ourselves are our own worst enemies. Rarely do we get to learn some of the things our government has been secretly doing on our behalf to deal with difficult truths, including exploring anomalous phenomena like UFOs. But every now and then, earth-shaking revelations are made by top-ranking officials of the government about the secrets the institutions they serve are keeping from the tax-paying public. And among such revelations is the recent acknowledgment by the Pentagon that it formed and funded a top-secret and long-running UFO investigation program.
On Saturday, December 16th, the New York Times and Politico published articles which revealed that the U.S. government – more specifically, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – had been funding a secret investigatory program that studied unexplained aerial phenomena or UAPs. It supposedly operated from the year 2007 until 2012 and taxpayers supposedly shelled out around $22 million during its entire five-year run.
Called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, this clandestine effort to study UAPs was initiated by former U.S. Senator and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate majority leader. Reid’s proposed UFO investigation program was backed by the late Senators Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Most of the budget allotted for the program went to an aerospace research company run by Nevada businessman and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow. Not only is he allegedly a close friend of Reid, he is also a passionate believer in the existence of aliens and is said to be the one who sparked the senator’s interest in UFOs and all things extraterrestrial in the first place. Reports also noted that Bigelow provided financial support to Reid’s campaign for Senate reelection in 2004 as well as in 2010.
The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was led by a U.S. military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo. As for what members of the program actually accomplished during its five-year existence, it was revealed that the secret UFO program mainly investigated the accounts of military and commercial pilots who claimed to have witnessed or encountered unexplained aircraft phenomena. Their reported sightings qualified as such if the aircraft they saw appeared to show no obvious or typical signs of propulsion or its flight pattern seemingly defied the fundamental laws of physics. This was not just to find proof of extraterrestrial presence on Earth but also to ascertain if some of the mysterious flying objects were actually secretly deployed by other powerful countries like Russia or China.
The officials in the program also interviewed and evaluated individuals who claimed to have felt or experienced some physical effects from their UFO encounters. But aside from interviewing people, the program supposedly recovered metal alloys and other physical evidence from discovered UAPs and stored them somewhere in Las Vegas.
Out of the program’s efforts, they managed to write a 490-page report about alleged UFO sightings all over the world for the past several decades. This report has yet to be disclosed to the public, and though the program did not manage to yield irrefutable proof of aliens visiting Earth, those who are part of the program, particularly Elizondo, believe that their findings warranted serious attention.
Funding of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was terminated by the United States Department of Defense back in 2012. As for why it had to end, Politico’s article mentioned a former congressional staffer who revealed that while the effort was a worthy endeavor in the beginning, the program failed to find anything of substance. And because they could no longer justify spending taxpayer money to investigate UFO sightings, the program was given a slow death.
However, some of those who supported the program believe that Pentagon is still allowing it to operate in some form and that officials even today are still investigating UAP or UFO sightings reported by service members while also attending to their other duties in the Defense Department.
Luis Elizondo, in particular, resigned from his position last October 2017, and he expressed his frustration regarding Pentagon’s indifference over the merits of the UFO investigatory program and the government organization’s refusal to fund its operations further. Elizondo also decried the government’s excessive secrecy over the subject matter and the internal opposition the program constantly faced. He also revealed that after his resignation, a new official had already been appointed to continue the covert UFO investigations of the U.S. government.
As for what Pentagon has to say about these revelations, the Defense Department, in response to an inquiry by Reuters, confirmed the existence and subsequent termination of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. According to the Pentagon’s spokeswoman Laura Ochoa, the UFO investigatory program ended in 2012 because the department found that there were more pressing, high-priority issues that deserved the funding the UFO program received. As such, the Department of Defense thought it was in the government and the public’s interest to make a change by terminating the program.
But on whether the Pentagon really ceased investigating UFO and UAP sightings, the U.S. defense department’s response is pretty much a non-answer. The organization neither confirmed nor denied that some of its officials are still handling UFO-related issues. Instead, it stressed that it takes “all threats and potential threats” very seriously and that the department promises to take action when they find “credible information” about such threats.
This is not the first time that it was revealed to the public that their government has been secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In fact, the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program is not the only UFO-related project initiated by the U.S. government. Some of this program’s known predecessors include Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, and they all shared similar objectives of gathering data about UFOs and determining whether they posed potential threats to national security and public safety.
Needless to say, this recently revealed UFO investigatory program is not the first of its kind and we can surely expect it won’t be the last. But of course, one can’t help but wonder what other shocking things the government is secretly doing without our knowledge.

  The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only relatively tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars). The Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, being 27% the size of Earth. The giant-impact theory hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a Mars-sized body, dubbed Theia, with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt (inclination) and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The Rare Earth hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative

 The current scientific understanding of the origins of life on Earth suggests the concept of universal common ancestry (UCA), which proposes that all life on Earth shares a single common ancestor. While the theory of UCA has gathered compelling circumstantial evidence, there has been no statistical test performed to confirm this hypothesis among the three domains of life (eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes) using molecular sequences.

However, a recent study by Theobald attempted to address this problem by conducting a formal statistical test. The study concluded that the UCA hypothesis holds based on the evidence gathered. It is important to note that while Theobald's study is a significant step towards establishing UCA with a solid statistical basis, some scientists have expressed reservations. They believe that Theobald's test may not be sufficient to reject the alternative hypothesis of separate origins of life.

In summary, the scientific understanding of the origins of life on Earth leans towards the concept of universal common ancestry. While more research and statistical tests are needed to fully validate this hypothesis, current evidence suggests a shared ancestry among all forms of life on our planet.

 1 0.40804 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force. For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death. Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck. WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world. "We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press. Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S. Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection. Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention." The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years. Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England. Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly. "Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston. "This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S. Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis . The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone." "For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah." Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said. "A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash." NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two. The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two." While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera. The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence. The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996. "There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive. "For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen." These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root. Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us. Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path. If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth. Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds. "We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light. "That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now. In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water. The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space. The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now. All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago? To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years. In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in

["The cornea is the clear, outer layer of the eye. It is responsible for sensing visual things. The cornea is made up of several layers, including the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. The epithelium is the outermost layer and is made up of cells that are constantly being replaced. The stroma is the thickest layer and is responsible for most of the cornea's optical properties. The endothelium is the innermost layer and is responsible for maintaining the cornea's shape and hydration. The cornea is unique in that it is the only part of the eye that is not supplied with blood vessels. Instead, it receives nutrients and oxygen through diffusion from the surrounding tissues. The cornea is also responsible for refracting light, which is essential for vision. The curvature of the cornea, along with the lens, helps to focus light on the retina, allowing us to see clearly. In addition to its role in vision, the cornea also plays a critical role in protecting the eye from injury and infection. The cornea is the most sensitive part of the eye, and any damage to the cornea can result in significant vision loss. Injuries to the cornea can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, and exposure to environmental factors such as wind and dust.

  The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. Light is then refracted when passed through the cornea because it has a curved convex shape. "The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left."(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium). The iris in eagles appears yellow and functions similarly to the iris in humans. The iris contracts and dilates to control the amount of light the received

  The human cornea is a transparent membrane which allows light to pass through it. The word corneal opacification literally means loss of normal transparency of cornea. The term corneal opacity is used particularly for the loss of transparency of cornea due to scarring. Transparency of the cornea is dependent on the uniform diameter and the regular spacing and arrangement of the collagen fibrils within the stroma. Alterations in the spacing of collagen fibrils in a variety of conditions including corneal edema, scars, and macular corneal dystrophy is clinically manifested as corneal opacity. The term "corneal blindness" is commonly used to describe blindness due to corneal opacity.

 episclera ; stroma ; lamina fusca ; endothelium The collagen of the sclera is continuous with the cornea. From outer to innermost, the four layers of the sclera are: The sclera is opaque due to the irregularity of the Type I collagen fibers, as opposed to the near-uniform thickness and parallel arrangement of the corneal collagen. Moreover, the cornea bears more mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate that has among its repeating units a nitrogenous sugar, hexosamine) to embed the fibrils. The cornea, unlike the sclera, has five layers. The middle, thickest layer is also called the stroma. The sclera, like the cornea, contains a basal endothelium, above which there is the lamina fusca, containing a high count of pigment cells. Sometimes, very small gray-blue spots can appear on the sclera, a harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis.

  It is a faint opacity which results due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial stroma. A nebular corneal opacity allows the details of the iris to be seen through the opacity. A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than a strictly localized dense leucoma, so long as the latter does not block the whole pupillary area. This is because the leucoma stops all the light which falls upon it, whereas the nebula refracts it irregularly, allowing many of the rays to fall upon the retina where they blur the image formed by the regularly refracted rays.

  The sclera, also known as the white of the eye or, in older literature, as the tunica albuginea oculi, is the opaque, fibrous, protective, outer layer of the human eye containing mainly collagen and some crucial elastic fiber. In humans, and some other vertebrates, the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in most mammals, the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show while other vertebrates have distinct colors for both of them. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. People with dark skin can have naturally darkened sclerae, the result of melanin pigmentation. The human eye is relatively rare for having a pale sclera (relative to the iris). This makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking, and the cooperative eye hypothesis suggests this has evolved as a method of nonverbal communication.

  The sclera forms the posterior five-sixths of the connective tissue coat of the globe. It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate (lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers (fasciculi) pass.

 The cornea is an essential structure in the eye that plays a crucial role in vision. It is the transparent outermost layer of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. There are several key characteristics and functions of the cornea that make it unique.

Firstly, the cornea is responsible for refracting, or bending, incoming light to focus it onto the retina. This bending of light allows for clear vision and enables us to see objects sharply. Along with the lens, the cornea plays a significant role in the eye's overall focusing power.

Secondly, the cornea is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels. This avascularity ensures the cornea remains transparent and allows light to pass through it smoothly. Instead of relying on blood vessels for nourishment, the cornea receives oxygen and nutrients from tears and the aqueous humor, the clear fluid filling the anterior chamber of the eye.

Thirdly, the cornea is highly sensitive due to the presence of numerous nerve endings. This sensitivity helps to protect the eye by triggering a blink reflex and causing us to close our eyes when an object comes too close. The corneal nerves also contribute to our ability to perceive pain in the eye, alerting us to potential issues or infections.

Additionally, the cornea is composed of several layers, each with its own specific functions. These layers include the epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium. The epithelium acts as a protective barrier against foreign substances and aids in the refractive properties of the cornea. The stroma, located beneath the epithelium, makes up the majority of the cornea's thickness and is responsible for its strength and stability.

It is important to note that various conditions can affect the cornea, such as corneal abrasions, infections, inflammation, or dystrophies. When these conditions arise, they can cause vision problems, discomfort, or even loss of vision. Treatment options for corneal conditions depend on the specific issue but may involve medications, contact lenses, or surgical intervention like corneal transplant.

In summary, the cornea is a vital part of the eye that contributes to clear vision by refracting light and protecting the delicate structures within the eye. Its transparency, avascularity, sensitivity, and layered structure all play essential roles in maintaining its functionality. Understanding the true nature and characteristics of the cornea helps us appreciate its significance in vision and the potential impact of various corneal conditions. The answer is D.

 the clear, transparent anterior covering of the eye (see also color plates). The cornea is subject to injury by foreign bodies in the eye, bacterial infection, and viral infection, especially by the herpesvirus that causes herpes simplex. The herpesvirus that causes herpes zoster (shingles) can also infect the cornea. Prompt treatment of any corneal injury or infection is essential to avoid ulceration and loss of vision.

that part of the SCLERA at the front of the eye of vertebrates overlaying the iris and lens. It is a transparent layer of EPITHELIUM and CONNECTIVE TISSUE through which light enters the eye and is refracted so that the lens can then focus it on the retina. The cornea contains no blood vessels, oxygen coming directly from air dissolved in tear secretions, and is therefore easy to transplant as no tissue-typing is required.
Clear, bowl-shaped structure at the front of the eye. It is located in front of the colored part of the eye (iris). The cornea lets light into the eye and partially focuses it.
The transparent anterior portion of the fibrous coat of the globe of the eye. It has a curvature somewhat greater than the rest of the globe, so a slight furrow marks its junction with the sclera. Looked at from the front the cornea is about 12 mm horizontally and 11 mm vertically. It is the first and most important refracting surface of the eye, having a power of about 42 D. The anterior surface has a radius of curvature of about 7.8 m, the posterior surface 6.5 mm, and the central thickness is about 0.5 mm. It consists of five layers, starting from the outside: (1) the stratified squamous epithelium; (2) Bowman's layer; (3) the stroma (substantia propria); (4) Descemet's membrane; and (5) the endothelium. The cornea is avascular, receiving its nourishment by permeation through spaces between the lamellae. The sources of nourishment are the aqueous humour, the tears and the limbal capillaries. The cornea is innervated by the long ciliary and other nerves of the surrounding conjunctiva, which are all branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Innervation is entirely sensory. Within the cornea there are only unmyelinated nerve endings. The density of nerves in the cornea is very high, making it the most sensitive structure in the body. The major structural component of the cornea is collagen, mostly type I, and most of the ground substance between the collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma is proteoglycans whose core proteins bind with keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B). The cornea owes its transparency to the regular arrangement of the collagen fibrils, but any factor that affects this lattice structure (e.g. swelling, pressure) results in a loss of transparency. The cornea contains some 78% water, some 15% collagen and some 5% of other proteins (Fig. C18).

cornea farinata A bilateral corneal degeneration characterized by faint dust-like opacities in the deep stroma. They do not impair vision and are usually age-related.
cornea guttata Dystrophy of the endothelial cells of the cornea which may result from corneal trauma, cataract surgery, keratic precipitates, tonography, ageing, continuous contact lens wear, or as part of the early stages of Fuch's endothelial dystrophy (a disease associated with ageing and with females more than males). It is seen clinically by slit-lamp examination as black spherules in the endothelial pattern. The condition is bilateral, although one eye may be affected more than the other. As the condition progresses the cornea becomes oedematous with a consequent loss of vision and eventually turns into bullous keratopathy. If the degenerated cells are located at the periphery of the cornea they are called Hassall-Henle bodies and are of no clinical significance except as an indication of ageing. Syn. corneal guttae; endothelial corneal dystrophy. See specular reflection illumination; keratic precipitates.
optical zone of cornea See optical zone of cornea.
cornea plana A rare, congenital, usually bilateral condition in which the corneal curvature is flatter than normal with a significant decrease in refractive power. The eye is usually hyperopic with a shallow anterior chamber often resulting in angle-closure glaucoma. There is some degree of peripheral scleralization and it is closely associated with sclerocornea.
Transparent tissue constituting the anterior sixth of the outer wall of the eye, with a 7.7-mm radius of curvature.
n the transparent anterior part of the eye.
the clear, transparent anterior segment of the fibrous tunic of the eye. The cornea is subject to injury by foreign bodies in the eye, and bacterial and viral infections. See also corneal, keratitis, keratopathy.
a congenital flattening of the cornea.
Q. Has anyone had experience with a corneal transplant because of keratoconus?
One of the most common reasons for a cornea transplant is a condition called keratoconus, which causes the cornea to change shape.
This surgery transplants the affected front area of the cornea with a healthy layer imported from an eye bank in the United States.
Many people in Oman who are suffering from infections in their corneas need transplants, but only a few are being admitted to Omani hospitals due to eye injuries.
Although there are some differences between the human and rabbit cornea in the recovering of endothelial function (faster in rabbits thanks to cell proliferation), the efficacy of stem cell treatment of alkali-injured cornea on the renewal of physiological levels of corneal hydration and on the restoration of transparency compared to untreated injured corneas or injured corneas treated with nanofibers free of cells was clearly shown in our rabbit model.
The cornea consists of the epithelium, which are the cells in the outermost layer; the stroma, which is comprised of connective tissue cells; the endothelium, a single layer of cells whose primary function is to maintain the cornea in a dehydrated state to help achieve optical clarity; and the Descemet's membrane, a thin, strong tissue that protects against infection and injury.
Surgeons often seek the youngest corneal tissue available regardless of patient age but historically, some surgeons set extremely restricting upper age limits, NIH said, and pointed out that when the study began in 2000, many surgeons would not accept corneas from donors over 65.
Having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea, we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients.
Before evaluation, cornea should be allowed to come to room temperature.
Transplantation of a donor cornea is the therapy of choice for a great number of those patients.
Corneal Collagen Cross Linking is a technique that strengthens the chemical bonds in one's cornea by applying Vitamin B2 followed by treatment with UV Light.
STEM cells, the body's "building blocks", are taken from the cornea of a dead donor and grown in a lab for around two weeks.

Looked at from the front the cornea is about 12 mm horizontally and 11 mm vertically. It is the first and most important refracting surface of the eye, having a power of about 42 D. The anterior surface has a radius of curvature of about 7.8 m, the posterior surface 6.5 mm, and the central thickness is about 0.5 mm. It consists of five layers, starting from the outside: (1) the stratified squamous epithelium; (2) Bowman's layer; (3) the stroma (substantia propria); (4) Descemet's membrane; and (5) the endothelium. The cornea is avascular, receiving its nourishment by permeation through spaces between the lamellae. The sources of nourishment are the aqueous humour, the tears and the limbal capillaries. The cornea is innervated by the long ciliary and other nerves of the surrounding conjunctiva, which are all branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Innervation is entirely sensory. Within the cornea there are only unmyelinated nerve endings. The density of nerves in the cornea is very high, making it the most sensitive structure in the body. The major structural component of the cornea is collagen, mostly type I, and most of the ground substance between the collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma is proteoglycans whose core proteins bind with keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B). The cornea owes its transparency to the regular arrangement of the collagen fibrils, but any factor that affects this lattice structure (e.g. swelling, pressure) results in a loss of transparency. The cornea contains some 78% water, some 15% collagen and some 5% of other proteins (Fig. C18).

cornea farinata A bilateral corneal degeneration characterized by faint dust-like opacities in the deep stroma. They do not impair vision and are usually age-related.
cornea guttata Dystrophy of the endothelial cells of the cornea which may result from corneal trauma, cataract surgery, keratic precipitates, tonography, ageing, continuous contact lens wear, or as part of the early stages of Fuch's endothelial dystrophy (a disease associated with ageing and with females more than males). It is seen clinically by slit-lamp examination as black spherules in the endothelial pattern. The condition is bilateral, although one eye may be affected more than the other. As the condition progresses the cornea becomes oedematous with a consequent loss of vision and eventually turns into bullous keratopathy. If the degenerated cells are located at the periphery of the cornea they are called Hassall-Henle bodies and are of no clinical significance except as an indication of ageing. Syn. corneal guttae; endothelial corneal dystrophy. See specular reflection illumination; keratic precipitates.
optical zone of cornea See optical zone of cornea.
cornea plana A rare, congenital, usually bilateral condition in which the corneal curvature is flatter than normal with a significant decrease in refractive power. The eye is usually hyperopic with a shallow anterior chamber often resulting in angle-closure glaucoma. There is some degree of peripheral scleralization and it is closely associated with sclerocornea.
Transparent tissue constituting the anterior sixth of the outer wall of the eye, with a 7.7-mm radius of curvature.

Q. Has anyone had experience with a corneal transplant because of keratoconus?
One of the most common reasons for a cornea transplant is a condition called keratoconus, which causes the cornea to change shape.
This surgery transplants the affected front area of the cornea with a healthy layer imported from an eye bank in the United States.
Many people in Oman who are suffering from infections in their corneas need transplants, but only a few are being admitted to Omani hospitals due to eye injuries.
Although there are some differences between the human and rabbit cornea in the recovering of endothelial function (faster in rabbits thanks to cell proliferation), the efficacy of stem cell treatment of alkali-injured cornea on the renewal of physiological levels of corneal hydration and on the restoration of transparency compared to untreated injured corneas or injured corneas treated with nanofibers free of cells was clearly shown in our rabbit model.
The cornea consists of the epithelium, which are the cells in the outermost layer; the stroma, which is comprised of connective tissue cells; the endothelium, a single layer of cells whose primary function is to maintain the cornea in a dehydrated state to help achieve optical clarity; and the Descemet's membrane, a thin, strong tissue that protects against infection and injury.
Surgeons often seek the youngest corneal tissue available regardless of patient age but historically, some surgeons set extremely restricting upper age limits, NIH said, and pointed out that when the study began in 2000, many surgeons would not accept corneas from donors over 65.
Having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea, we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients.
Before evaluation, cornea should be allowed to come to room temperature.
Transplantation of a donor cornea is the therapy of choice for a great number of those patients.
Corneal Collagen Cross Linking is a technique that strengthens the chemical bonds in one's cornea by applying Vitamin B2 followed by treatment with UV Light.
STEM cells, the body's "building blocks", are taken from the cornea of a dead donor and grown in a lab for around two weeks.
 2 -1.44170 The cornea is an essential structure in the eye that plays a crucial role in vision. It is the transparent outermost layer of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. There are several key characteristics and functions of the cornea that make it unique.

Firstly, the cornea is responsible for refracting, or bending, incoming light to focus it onto the retina. This bending of light allows for clear vision and enables us to see objects sharply. Along with the lens, the cornea plays a significant role in the eye's overall focusing power.

Secondly, the cornea is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels. This avascularity ensures the cornea remains transparent and allows light to pass through it smoothly. Instead of relying on blood vessels for nourishment, the cornea receives oxygen and nutrients from tears and the aqueous humor, the clear fluid filling the anterior chamber of the eye.

Thirdly, the cornea is highly sensitive due to the presence of numerous nerve endings. This sensitivity helps to protect the eye by triggering a blink reflex and causing us to close our eyes when an object comes too close. The corneal nerves also contribute to our ability to perceive pain in the eye, alerting us to potential issues or infections.

Additionally, the cornea is composed of several layers, each with its own specific functions. These layers include the epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium. The epithelium acts as a protective barrier against foreign substances and aids in the refractive properties of the cornea. The stroma, located beneath the epithelium, makes up the majority of the cornea's thickness and is responsible for its strength and stability.

It is important to note that various conditions can affect the cornea, such as corneal abrasions, infections, inflammation, or dystrophies. When these conditions arise, they can cause vision problems, discomfort, or even loss of vision. Treatment options for corneal conditions depend on the specific issue but may involve medications, contact lenses, or surgical intervention like corneal transplant.

In summary, the cornea is a vital part of the eye that contributes to clear vision by refracting light and protecting the delicate structures within the eye. Its transparency, avascularity, sensitivity, and layered structure all play essential roles in maintaining its functionality. Understanding the true nature and characteristics of the cornea helps us appreciate its significance in vision and the potential impact of various corneal conditions.

 4 -9.14474  The sclera, also known as the white of the eye or, in older literature, as the tunica albuginea oculi, is the opaque, fibrous, protective, outer layer of the human eye containing mainly collagen and some crucial elastic fiber. In humans, and some other vertebrates, the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in most mammals, the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show while other vertebrates have distinct colors for both of them. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. People with dark skin can have naturally darkened sclerae, the result of melanin pigmentation. The human eye is relatively rare for having a pale sclera (relative to the iris). This makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking, and the cooperative eye hypothesis suggests this has evolved as a method of nonverbal communication.
 5 -9.98101  The sclera forms the posterior five-sixths of the connective tissue coat of the globe. It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate (lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers (fasciculi) pass. The thickness of the sclera

["As the sun began to rise over the vast expanse of the desert, a group of adventurers set out on a journey to explore the unknown. Among them was a young woman named Lily, who carried with her a small, red balloon.\n\nLily had always been fascinated by the way balloons worked, and she had spent countless hours studying the science behind them. She knew that when a balloon is heated, the air inside expands, causing the balloon to grow larger.\n\nAs the group trekked through the scorching desert, Lily's balloon began to heat up. The sun beat down on it, causing the air inside to expand rapidly. The balloon grew larger and larger, until it was nearly twice its original size.\n\nThe other adventurers watched in amazement as Lily's balloon continued to grow, lifting her off the ground and carrying her higher and higher into the sky. They cheered and clapped as she soared above them, her red balloon a bright and vibrant sight against the backdrop of the desert.\n\nBut as the sun began to set, Lily's balloon began to cool down. The air inside contracted, causing the balloon to shrink back down to its original size. Lily landed gently back on the ground, her heart racing with excitement and adrenaline.\n\nThe other adventurers gathered around her, marveling at the incredible feat", 'What would happen when balloons heat up?What would happen when balloons heat up?\nA. they get bigger\nB. they get smaller\nC. nothing happens\nD. they fall down']

The mystical man gives Jerry a cake that tastes of whatever the eater likes best, and replenishes itself whenever the eater takes a bite. However, when Jerry returns to Chubby after finding food for her, the two children realize the kite is gone. At this time it is dark out and night has begun. It is also at this time that Jerry and Chubby meet another mystical creature called a wymp. The wymp appears out of nowhere and explains to the children that the kite failed to fly to the moon earlier because it was daytime and there

  A young boy named Jerry made the largest kite in the town with his own hands. His friend, Chubby – the woodcutter's daughter – painted a moon and several stars on the kite. Jerry feels proud of the kite, and heads to the field to make it fly to the moon. Jerry attempts to fly the kite in the day with all the other boys and girls watching, but unfortunately the kite fails to fly. Jerry feels defeated and embarrassed as the village children laugh at him, and he goes to find Chubby. Together, Jerry and Chubby take the kite and proceed to go on a quest to find someone who knows why Jerry's kite will not fly. As the two set off further into the woods, Chubby becomes unbearably hungry, forcing

The two children and the wymp ride a comet up to the moon, where they find Jerry's kite and meet the shimmering, delicate Lady of the Moon. The wymp disappears, for it is frightened of The Lady of the Moon. The stern Lady of the Moon is not happy the children have entered her territory, and she tells them to leave. Before they are swallowed up by the setting of the moon, the children ride the kite back home, showing all the other children in the village that the kite really could fly. The kite, however, returns to the sky and remains a comet for the rest of time.

At midnight, a dark cloud blinded them, and Dotterine's godmother appeared. She told the king that Dotterine had never been his sister by birth, she was, instead, a princess from a neighboring kingdom, entrusted to his mother by her to raise to protect her from an evil wizard. She vanished, and so did the basket, but Dotterine lived happily with the king ever after.

  The book tells the story of Patricia, her brother Steve, and her cousin Steve spending the summer at their grandparents' farm in Union City, Michigan. Late one night while sitting in their cozy home, a bright light falls from the sky landing in the Gaw's farm with a loud crash. Curiosity overcomes the family as they set foot outside to find a fallen star in their backyard. One line in the book reads, “Of all the places on earth a meteor could have fallen, it landed smack-dab in the middle of our yard, Gramma exclaimed.” This was such a huge deal for the residents of Mudsock Medow. Word gets around quickly, and before long there is a carnival at the Gaw farm. There is a band, a circus, a hot air balloon, and more. The entire town gathers to celebrate the meteor. Many residents touched the meteor claiming it was magical. It seemed like magic to all that the fallen star, which flew through the galaxy, had landed in Union City and brought such joy to all.

  A queen told an old woman that she had two griefs: a new one, that her husband was at war, and an old one, that they had no children. She gave her a basket with an egg: the queen was to put it somewhere warm. In three months, it would break and let out a doll. She was to let it alone, and then it would become a baby girl. She would have a baby of her own, a son, and she was to put the girl with him and show them both to the king, and then raise the son herself but entrust

She found the basket, thought something in it might amuse her, and found only a feather. She threw it out the window. A beautiful woman appeared and told her that she was her godmother; she talked with her, told her how to use the basket to feed herself, and said that to summon her, she need only throw the goose wing out the window.

 If you’ve got excess pounds to lose but don’t qualify for bariatric surgery, a new non-surgical, fully reversible weight loss option will soon be offered at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
The Obalon balloon system — three swallowable balloons that remain inside the stomach during treatment — was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration following a national clinical trial at 15 sites, including VUMC. The treatment will be offered at the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss by early 2017.
Before participating in a clinical trial for a non-surgical weight loss treatment, Anissa Sanborn had tried multiple diets to lose weight. The photo above was taken before the trial. Below: Sanborn lost 32 pounds during the study and continues to lose weight due to changes she’s made in her diet and daily activities.
Typically, an individual with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 with two comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, or a BMI of more than 40 without comorbidities, is eligible for bariatric surgery. The balloon system is available to individuals with a lower BMI of 30-40, so it is an earlier intervention for treating obesity.
“After gaining weight to a BMI of 30 or greater, there is a significant increase in the number of medical problems that develop — such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol — and there are significant costs associated with taking care of those medical problems,” said Wayne English, M.D., director of the Vanderbilt Center for Surgical Weight Loss and principal investigator for the clinical trial at Vanderbilt.
The system consists of a balloon inside a capsule that is swallowed by the patient, with no sedation or anesthesia necessary.
When the balloon reaches the stomach and the capsule dissolves, it is inflated with gas through a micro-catheter still attached to the balloon. The catheter is then removed, leaving the balloon behind. The inflated balloon is about the size of a small orange.
Over the next three months, two additional balloons are swallowed and inflated. The balloons take up space in the stomach, limiting how much a person can eat. At the end of a six-month treatment period, the balloons are removed through an outpatient endoscopy.
In the clinical trial, 387 patients received either three balloons or three placebo devices similar to the balloon-filled capsules but filled with sugar. Patients in both groups also received dietary and lifestyle counseling. Approximately 65 percent of patients who received the balloon system experienced clinically meaningful weight loss of at least 5 percent of their total body weight, which is twice as many people than in the placebo-control group.
Being overweight was a genetic fact of life in Anissa Sanborn’s family, but after watching 11 family members go through gastric bypass surgery to lose their excess pounds, the 47-year-old working mother decided she wanted to lose weight before surgery became one of the few options to do so.
When knee and joint problems worsened and she struggled with high blood pressure, Sanborn wanted to get the pounds off before she developed more issues. Through the years, she had cycled through many diets and weight loss programs, with little long-term success.
Because her BMI was in the 30-40 range, she didn’t qualify for gastric bypass surgery.
That’s when she signed up for the clinical trial offered by English and his team at Vanderbilt.
Though she wound up being in the placebo group, after her initial trial period was complete Sanborn received the actual balloons for treatment. She received dietary and lifestyle counseling at the center, and she especially credits the advice she received from VUMC registered dietitian Erin Grayson for her success.
Sanborn lost 32 pounds at the study’s conclusion, and through dietary management and increased exercise, she continues to shed weight, having lost 50 pounds to date. In addition, her blood pressure has lowered, so she has decreased the medication she takes.
Sanborn now tracks her caloric intake, finds ways to sneak in exercise such as adding a mini-cycle to peddle under her desk, and looks forward to walks with her husband, Doug, daughter, Kate, and their energetic goldendoodle dog, Charlie.
English is hopeful that the balloon-based weight loss procedure will get patients in the door earlier for help in reversing weight gain, and he is heartened by the possibility that he will perform fewer gastric surgeries in the future because of this option.
Those interested in this weight loss option should contact Andrea Reed at andrea.w.reed@vanderbilt.edu.

On 20 June 2012, Allen tweeted that she was in the studio working with Greg Kurstin on new music. She changed her professional name from Lily Allen to Lily Rose Cooper. In August 2013, she changed her professional name back to Lily Allen and tweeted new music would be arriving "soon". Following the release of Sheezus, Allen experienced an identity crisis and opined that she had lost agency to her label, Parlophone. In 2018, Allen described "Air Balloon" as her least favourite song, and agreed with a fan who suggested that it "stunk of label pressure as a lead single".

"Puff." On the screen, the stent is now in place inside the stenosis. "Inflate," Altschuler says sharply. The technician switches on a handheld hydraulic pump to inflate a tiny balloon inside the stent, expanding the stent to push against the vessel walls. "Fourteen," says Altschuler. "Sixteen." He is counting out the balloon inflation pressure inside the stent. "Down!" The technician turns off the pump with a loud click, and Altschuler quickly extracts the balloon and wire from Crofton's blood vessel leaving the stent behind. At the next puff of contrast, everyone looks to the screen. In the spot where the last picture showed nothing, not a branch or a twig below the blockage, Crofton's arteries are once again filling and emptying rhythmically with each beat of her heart. Crofton's coronary artery is doing its job once again, supplying the heart muscle, that fist-sized pump that keeps us going, beat by beat, day in and day out, with life-giving blood. Technicians and nurses resume their activities around the room. The red line on the heart monitor that had been shooting up and down wildly is now oscillating within normal range. Without comment, Altschuler turns back to his task, rethreading the wire up the catheter into the next blocked artery. Today, more than two million Americans a year find themselves lying on a catheterization table as a flexible wire is threaded through their femoral arteries and into their hearts. About eight hundred thousand of those catheterizations are performed on people in the throes of a heart attack, the patients who generally have the most to gain from an angioplasty or stent. But the vast majority of invasive cardiology procedures aren't aimed at saving lives.Of those 1.2 million elective cardiac procedures, at least 160,000 are "inappropriate," meaning they should not have been done, according to cardiologists' own rules for when to put in a stent or do an angioplasty.When outside cardiologists looked at the patient records from Redding Medical Center, they found hundreds of such inappropriate cases.

In the spot where the last picture showed nothing, not a branch or a twig below the blockage, Crofton's arteries are once again filling and emptying rhythmically with each beat of her heart. Crofton's coronary artery is doing its job once again, supplying the heart muscle, that fist-sized pump that keeps us going, beat by beat, day in and day out, with life-giving blood. Technicians and nurses resume their activities around the room. The red line on the heart monitor that had been shooting up and down wildly is now oscillating within normal range. Without comment, Altschuler turns back to his task, rethreading the wire up the catheter into the next blocked artery. Today, more than two million Americans a year find themselves lying on a catheterization table as a flexible wire is threaded through their femoral arteries and into their hearts. About eight hundred thousand of those catheterizations are performed on people in the throes of a heart attack, the patients who generally have the most to gain from an angioplasty or stent. But the vast majority of invasive cardiology procedures aren't aimed at saving lives.Of those 1.2 million elective cardiac procedures, at least 160,000 are "inappropriate," meaning they should not have been done, according to cardiologists' own rules for when to put in a stent or do an angioplasty.When outside cardiologists looked at the patient records from Redding Medical Center, they found hundreds of such inappropriate cases.

These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft's on-board radar. On 30 December 1978, a television crew from Australia recorded background film for a network show of interviews about the sightings. For many minutes at a time on the flight to Christchurch, unidentified lights were observed by five people on the flight deck, were tracked by Wellington Air Traffic Controllers, and filmed in colour by the television crew. One object reportedly followed the aircraft almost until landing. The cargo plane

The astronaut who made the comments, Frank Borman, later confirmed that what he saw was not a UFO, and that when he offered to go on the television show Unsolved Mysteries to clarify, the producers told him, "Well, I'm not sure we want you on the program."

  The Kaikoura lights is a name given by the New Zealand media to a series of UFO sightings that occurred in December 1978, over the skies above the Kaikoura mountain ranges in the northeast of New Zealand's South Island. The first sightings were made on 21 December when the crew of a Safe Air Ltd cargo aircraft began observing a series of strange lights around their Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy aircraft, which tracked along with their aircraft for several minutes before disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere. The UFO was very large and had five white flashing lights that were visible on the craft. Some people say that they could see some little disks drop

  UFO sightings in outer space are sightings of unidentified flying objects reported by astronauts while in space that they could not explain at the time. These sightings have been claimed as evidence for alien visits by ufologists. Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission. UFO proponents see comments by astronauts or photos processed by NASA as one of the "strongest bodies of evidence" because they are considered to be of high trustworthiness; however, NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Robert F.

 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force.
For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death.
Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck.
WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world.
"We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S.
Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection.
Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention."
The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years.
Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England.
Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly.
"Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis .
The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone."
"For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah."
Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
"A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash."
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two.
The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two."
While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera.
The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence.
The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996.
"There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive.
"For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen."
These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root.
Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.
Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path.
If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth.
Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds.
"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light.
"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now.
In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water.
The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space.
The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now.
All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago?
To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years.
In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in this region is indicative that this area may have once been an ocean. The agency’s findings using subsurface radar are not surprising but they have added to the existing data gathered from images, atmospheric measurements and mineralogical study of the planet which already previously pinpointed the northern plains to be the site of ancient Martian shorelines.

Within that same year, planetary scientist Francis McCubbin of the University Of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues published a study on Martian meteorites containing hydrated minerals which allowed them to estimate how much water exists today in the Martian mantle. The authors of the study determined that Mars has enough water in its mantle to submerge the planet for as deep as 200 to 1000 meters. This means the planet is currently shrouding around 70 to 300 parts per million of liquid water somewhere beneath its surface.
Then there’s also the study published by the international journal Icarus in 2014 which revealed that a team of geologists found evidence of a vast ancient underground ocean located beneath the surface of Aram Chaos, one of the impact craters on Mars. Around 2.5 billion years ago, about 93,000 cubic kilometers of water supposedly broke through and flooded the surface after the lake ice – which was concealed underground – melted and its ceiling suddenly collapsed.
Here’s an idea how much water reached the Martian surface at the time: they say it is equivalent to around 80% of the free-flowing fresh water that exists on our own planet today.
In 2015, researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, led by planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva, developed infrared maps of water isotopes on Mars which showed the distribution of atmospheric water on the planet - H2O and its deuterated form, HDO. In doing so, they were able to estimate how much liquid water Mars used to have. According to their findings, Mars may have once had enough water to cover up to 20 percent or about a fifth of the planet more than 4 billion years ago. They also suggested that the planet could still contain some subterranean water reservoirs and that the key to finding them lies in refining the infrared maps they had developed.
That same year, another study revealed that NASA’s Curiosity rover – which landed on Mars’s Gale Crater back in 2012 – managed to measure estimates of the concentration of subterranean water on the planet. The new measurements suggested that the soil in Mars is moist with liquid brine. The presence of this liquid brine is supposedly caused by the perchlorate salts found in the soil as it is known to reduce the freezing point of water. The salt is the one responsible for absorbing the water vapor from the atmosphere which then precipitated under the surface. The researchers considered this find as an indirect evidence of transient liquid water on the planet though they insist that the presence of liquid brine is not enough to deem Mars equipped to support terrestrial organisms.
A similar finding was reached that same year by examining the data and images gathered from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO. At the time, the researchers believed that the dark streaks found on Martian craters is actually Martian soil being dampened by briny water, which may have been enough to allow microbial life to thrive on the planet. However, authors of a later study argued against the hypothesis that there is liquid water on the Martina surface, suggesting instead that the dark streaks captured by the MRO’s powerful camera were just grains of sand and dust that occasionally slipped downhill.
An underground layer of water ice was also detected within the planet’s Utopia Planitia region. Researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter again, particularly its ground-penetrating Shallow Radar instrument, which is also referred to as SHARAD. After they analyzed the data provided by the high-powered radar, they discovered a massive deposit of water ice in the area that is much bigger than the State of Mexico. This subterranean ice deposit runs deep – between an estimated thickness of 260 feet to around 560 feet. Fifty to eight-five percent of the deposit is made of ice while the rest is made up of dust and rock particles.
The water ice deposit in Utopia Planitia managed to elude the danger of being vaporized by the planet’s hostile atmosphere because of the thick soil that successfully separated the two. Estimates of the soil’s thickness in this region range between 3 to 33 feet.
Another compelling evidence that supports the theory that an ancient underground ocean is hidden beneath the Red Planet’s surface comes from the reanalyzed data from NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft which has been orbiting the planet since 2001. Researchers found patches of water ice in regions at surprisingly lower latitudes. Should this equatorial ice eventually melt and reach the surface, it is presumed that it would very likely result to the formation of a more accommodating environment that could be perfect for the survival and growth of microbial life.
Despite the vast amount of research that has gone into finding water and life on Mars, many of the missing pieces needed to complete the entire picture of what happened to this unique Red Planet and what remains there now have yet to be found. However, it is safe to say that we know more about our neighbor planet now more than we did before, and most of the information we have learned about Mars has only strengthened our scientific community’s conviction that liquid water once filled a sizeable portion of the planet’s surface and may still be lurking beneath its porous subterranean rocks.
Since the first Apollo mission in 1969, astronauts have since reported strange flashes of light on the surface of the moon that seems to come out of nowhere.
Many scientists have made speculations about the cause and possible origins of the flashing lights but none of them have ever come close to being a definitive explanation.
However, there are some theories that may hold a little weight in explaining the occurrence of these strange flashes. So, in today’s video we are exploring some of the theories as we try to figure out these mysterious flashes of light on the surface of the moon.
As mentioned earlier, astronauts since the first moon landing by Apollo 11 have reported sighting s of flashing lights on the moon’s surface. What’s strange about it is that they have reported these flashes even when their eyes are closed.
In one documentary, the lights were allegedly seen by several of the Apollo astronauts as they approached the moon.
Astronauts who have encountered the lights would describe it as white flashes but there are others that have reported back after encountering lights in different colours such as blue and yellow; and in almost all instances, after they have come back home to earth, astronauts who have come across these lights would still see these flashes under various lighting conditions.
A theory explains why these astronauts are seeing what they were seeing and it all points towards cosmic rays.
Defined as a “highly energetic atomic nucleus or particle that travels through space at a speed close to that of light”, these rays – and how they interacted with the human optic nerve – are responsible for the eyes seeing strange lights in varying degrees of colours depending on how much radiation from cosmic rays the optic nerve has absorbed.
To test this theory, engineers put together an experiment involving a black box that can be worn as a helmet. The box would then have sensors that would detect the presence of cosmic rays.
Astronaut Charles Duke wore the helmet on his next mission and reported back seeing clusters of lights and white streaks the same time the box detected the presence of cosmic rays in his immediate environment.
Another theory explaining the flashes of lights is the existence of cold spots on the moon’s surface. These cold spots have been discovered to have layers of thin ice and frost that, when lights from the sun reflects on it, creates flashing or blinking that may trick the eye into believing that the lights are coming from the moon itself.
Revealed from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO, the data brought back helped researches identify certain areas on the moon’s south pole that are cold enough to have frost formations. These formations are suspected to be located in craters where temperatures can drop to negative 163 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore, the research suggests that the icy deposits on the moon appear to be thin and in patches and may be mixed in with the moon’s soil and dust. Also, the evidence of frost suggests that the moon may either have water deposits for millions of years or may have been brought by colliding asteroids which may also explain how water was delivered on the surface of the earth.
Although, another hypothesis points out that hydrogen may have been present in a different form on the surface of the moon – but the idea that the moon could store water ice is still difficult to confirm and is being looked into for over 50 years now and since 2009 understanding the main composition of these icy deposits are still being studied and remains one of the main goals of the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter.
This is a controversial area of study that mainly involves looking into bright sparks on the moon’s surface, discolourations, or misty patches of lunar fog.
Transient Lunar Phenomenon was a term created by Sir Patrick Moore in 1968 in order to give the sightings credence in the scientific community. However, these sightings have existed for more than a millennium according to studies on the subject.
One of the early records of this phenomenon was traced back to a mistake made in the 16th Century when early astronomers spotted a “daytime star” near the moon but was later on discovered to be the planet Venus.
Fast forward to 1969 to a time when astronomy has made larger strides since the 16th Century; during the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong remarked that there was “an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area” of the moon.
After several studies conducted by NASA after the Apollo 11 mission, various photographs and images have been taken and produced in order to find the root cause of the strange lights.
Unfortunately, unlike the sudden flashes caused by asteroids on impact, the illumination on the surface of the moon appears to be much more subtle and harder to trace.
In a study conducted by the British Astronomical Association led by Jill Scrambler, the amount of data used between 1700 and 2010 were impressive and the studies conducted on each of them were extremely thorough as each data from different observers – from amateur to seasoned astronomers – were weighed for reliability.
The result was that at least 2% of the TLP sightings were considered “definitive” and unambiguous”. To put it simply: there really is something happening on the surface of the moon, we just aren’t sure what it is. To this very day, researchers are not clear as to what the real cause of TLPs is.
Fortunately for scientists and astronomers continuing to conduct their research on the phenomenon, a new spacecraft called the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer was launched in the summer of 2013 to better explore the surface of the moon and provide clearer explanations about these mysterious illuminations and flashing lights.
SYDNEY (AP) — One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I.
No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week.
While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.
"It was the first loss for the RAN and the first Allied submarine loss in World War I — a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies," Payne said in a statement.
The AE1 made final contact with an Australian ship at 2:30 p.m. the day it disappeared. Mystified villagers on a nearby island at the time spoke of seeing a "monster" or "devil fish" that appeared and quickly disappeared into the water.
For years, the United States government has always tried to maintain a safe and somewhat skeptical position when it concerns the possibility of alien life and likelihood that extraterrestrial beings may try to visit our planet or have already succeeded in doing so. Whenever footage or information on unexpected sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs are released and made known to the public, government institutions are quick to refute the possibility that the origins of these aerial objects are not of this world. Instead, they offer explanations that they deem more plausible, completely veering the public’s attention and curiosity from topics they feel are best left undiscussed. Perhaps this is to prevent the public from descending into chaos because of their misguided fears. Or, perhaps it is to spare the rest of us from having to deal with difficult truths while those in the government covertly act with our best interests supposedly always in mind.
Usually, it’s the former. Most of the time, our excessively creative imaginations and our tendency to get ahead of ourselves are our own worst enemies. Rarely do we get to learn some of the things our government has been secretly doing on our behalf to deal with difficult truths, including exploring anomalous phenomena like UFOs. But every now and then, earth-shaking revelations are made by top-ranking officials of the government about the secrets the institutions they serve are keeping from the tax-paying public. And among such revelations is the recent acknowledgment by the Pentagon that it formed and funded a top-secret and long-running UFO investigation program.
On Saturday, December 16th, the New York Times and Politico published articles which revealed that the U.S. government – more specifically, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency – had been funding a secret investigatory program that studied unexplained aerial phenomena or UAPs. It supposedly operated from the year 2007 until 2012 and taxpayers supposedly shelled out around $22 million during its entire five-year run.
Called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, this clandestine effort to study UAPs was initiated by former U.S. Senator and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate majority leader. Reid’s proposed UFO investigation program was backed by the late Senators Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Most of the budget allotted for the program went to an aerospace research company run by Nevada businessman and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow. Not only is he allegedly a close friend of Reid, he is also a passionate believer in the existence of aliens and is said to be the one who sparked the senator’s interest in UFOs and all things extraterrestrial in the first place. Reports also noted that Bigelow provided financial support to Reid’s campaign for Senate reelection in 2004 as well as in 2010.
The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was led by a U.S. military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo. As for what members of the program actually accomplished during its five-year existence, it was revealed that the secret UFO program mainly investigated the accounts of military and commercial pilots who claimed to have witnessed or encountered unexplained aircraft phenomena. Their reported sightings qualified as such if the aircraft they saw appeared to show no obvious or typical signs of propulsion or its flight pattern seemingly defied the fundamental laws of physics. This was not just to find proof of extraterrestrial presence on Earth but also to ascertain if some of the mysterious flying objects were actually secretly deployed by other powerful countries like Russia or China.
The officials in the program also interviewed and evaluated individuals who claimed to have felt or experienced some physical effects from their UFO encounters. But aside from interviewing people, the program supposedly recovered metal alloys and other physical evidence from discovered UAPs and stored them somewhere in Las Vegas.
Out of the program’s efforts, they managed to write a 490-page report about alleged UFO sightings all over the world for the past several decades. This report has yet to be disclosed to the public, and though the program did not manage to yield irrefutable proof of aliens visiting Earth, those who are part of the program, particularly Elizondo, believe that their findings warranted serious attention.
Funding of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was terminated by the United States Department of Defense back in 2012. As for why it had to end, Politico’s article mentioned a former congressional staffer who revealed that while the effort was a worthy endeavor in the beginning, the program failed to find anything of substance. And because they could no longer justify spending taxpayer money to investigate UFO sightings, the program was given a slow death.
However, some of those who supported the program believe that Pentagon is still allowing it to operate in some form and that officials even today are still investigating UAP or UFO sightings reported by service members while also attending to their other duties in the Defense Department.
Luis Elizondo, in particular, resigned from his position last October 2017, and he expressed his frustration regarding Pentagon’s indifference over the merits of the UFO investigatory program and the government organization’s refusal to fund its operations further. Elizondo also decried the government’s excessive secrecy over the subject matter and the internal opposition the program constantly faced. He also revealed that after his resignation, a new official had already been appointed to continue the covert UFO investigations of the U.S. government.
As for what Pentagon has to say about these revelations, the Defense Department, in response to an inquiry by Reuters, confirmed the existence and subsequent termination of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program. According to the Pentagon’s spokeswoman Laura Ochoa, the UFO investigatory program ended in 2012 because the department found that there were more pressing, high-priority issues that deserved the funding the UFO program received. As such, the Department of Defense thought it was in the government and the public’s interest to make a change by terminating the program.
But on whether the Pentagon really ceased investigating UFO and UAP sightings, the U.S. defense department’s response is pretty much a non-answer. The organization neither confirmed nor denied that some of its officials are still handling UFO-related issues. Instead, it stressed that it takes “all threats and potential threats” very seriously and that the department promises to take action when they find “credible information” about such threats.
This is not the first time that it was revealed to the public that their government has been secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In fact, the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program is not the only UFO-related project initiated by the U.S. government. Some of this program’s known predecessors include Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, and they all shared similar objectives of gathering data about UFOs and determining whether they posed potential threats to national security and public safety.
Needless to say, this recently revealed UFO investigatory program is not the first of its kind and we can surely expect it won’t be the last. But of course, one can’t help but wonder what other shocking things the government is secretly doing without our knowledge.

  most often during early evening hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a "fiery" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports that it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw. Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART at Area 51 agree that their work inadvertently

  Identifying unidentified flying objects is a difficult task due to the normally poor quality of the evidence provided by those who report sighting the unknown object. Observations and subsequent reporting are often made by those untrained in astronomy, atmospheric phenomena, aeronautics, physics, and perception. Nevertheless, most officially investigated UFO sightings, such as from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, have been identified as being due to honest misidentifications of natural phenomena, aircraft, or other prosaic explanations. In early U.S. Air Force attempts to explain UFO sightings, unexplained sightings routinely numbered over one in five reports. However, in early 1953, right after the CIA's Robertson Panel, percentages of unexplained sightings dropped precipitously, usually being only a few percent in any given year. When Project Blue Book closed down in 1970, only 6% of all cases were classified as being truly unidentified. UFOs that can be explained are sometimes termed "IFOs" or Identified Flying Objects.

  the varying beliefs found among ufo writers over the course of ufo history. Allen Greenfield confessed in Magonia in 1979 he had become disenchanted with the divisive emotionality and groupthink of ufo culture and worried about the influence of belief he eventually saw in his early work advocating the ETH. He was starting to think the bigger mystery was not what ufos were, but "What are we to make of the whole world-wide rumor complex…what are we to make of the rumor – the ufo mythos?" What was the meaning of all the mythologizing that attends the spread of the ufo rumor?

  UFOs have been reported on Winter Hill. In 1950, a witness described a "dark flat iron shaped object hovering close to the ground" and an encounter with a being that returned to a craft before disappearing. In 1999, in what became known as the "Murphy Incident", a farmer said he saw an object hovering over his cattle field. On investigation, the object moved away and the farmer reported the incident to the police. The farmer returned to the field and discovered the object had reappeared. He reported the incident to the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team (MAPIT), who investigated it. While MAPIT was conducting its investigation, they alleged they were being followed by a man in a vehicle. The farmer reported that he was warned by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but has not been traced since the incident, and the current owner has not spoken about it. The UK government released previously classified information on UFO sightings in May 2006; one picture appeared to show an unidentified object over Winter Hill.

 1 0.40846 The touch of death goes by many names. In China, it is known as the Dim Mak, while in Japan, a fighting style involving pressure point fighting is referred to as Kyushojutsu. Also called death-point striking, this deadly martial arts technique - when done right - could potentially kill an opponent by striking a specific area of the body with a seemingly gentle but devastatingly critical force. For now, though, we don’t have enough scientific and historical evidence to say with absolute certainty that the “touch of death” is indeed an effective and deadly technique. What can be confirmed is the fact that subjecting certain areas of the human body to immense pressure or trauma can result in an unexpected scale of damage or injury to the person attacked - sometimes even death. Another real-life medical example similar to how the Dim Mak strike works is by blocking the blood flow to the brain via the carotid artery. Applying pressure to this common artery will not only result in unconsciousness but it may also lead to brain damage. Doing so is also not that difficult considering that the carotid artery hides in plain sight - the neck. WASHINGTON (AP) — A first-of-its kind genetic treatment for blindness will cost $850,000, less than the $1 million price tag that had been expected, but it's still among the most expensive genetic therapies in the world. "We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients," said CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo, in an interview with The Associated Press. Luxturna is still significantly more expensive than nearly every other drug on the global market, including two other gene therapies approved earlier last year in the U.S. Approved last month, Luxturna, is the nation's first gene therapy for an inherited disease. It can improve the vision of those with a rare form of blindness that is estimated to affect just a few thousand people in the U.S. Luxturna is an injection — one for each eye — that replaces a defective gene in the retina, tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electric signals that produce vision. The therapy will cost $425,000 per injection. Not everyone agrees with that argument. A preliminary analysis by one group found the drug would have to be priced significantly lower "to be a cost-effective intervention." The estimate by the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assumes the drug would maintain patients' vision for 10 years. However, Spark expects the drug's effect to be long-lasting, if not lifelong, though it has only tracked patients for about four years. Spark will try to deflect some pricing concerns by offering unconventional payment plans to insurers. Under one arrangement with the non-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, Spark will repay some of Luxturna's costs if patients don't experience the expected improvements in vision. The company did not disclose how much money would be returned to the insurer, which covers more than a million people in New England. Spark said it is also discussing a proposal in which insurers would pay for the drug in installments over several years. That idea would apply to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health coverage to the poor and elderly. "Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst," and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston. "This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced," said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S. Pretty much. While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal (3.4 degrees Celsius), according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis . The cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the East Coast this weekend because of a monster storm that's brewing in the Atlantic and Caribbean, what meteorologists are calling a "snow hurricane" or "bomb cyclone." "For the Northeast, this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm," said Jason Furtado, a University of Oklahoma meteorology professor. "We could be ending (the cold snap) with a big hurrah." Don't confuse weather — which is a few days or weeks in one region — with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said. "A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change," Furtado said. "That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash." NEW DELHI (AP) — India's capital launched a metro train with driverless technology Monday, though officials said it would operate with a driver for at least a year or two. The Delhi Metro Rail Corp. has said the highly automated train will run initially with a driver but could become driverless in the future. An official told the Indian Express newspaper that it would have human operators for "a year or two." While a lot of people wouldn't think of pigs as being 'good looking', there is an uncontested winner for the title of 'world's ugliest pig'. This porker was feared extinct but has recently been spotted on a trail camera. The Javan Warty Pig won't be winning any beauty pageants, but scientists have snapped a picture showing that the species does have a chance at continued existence. The warty pig has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) endangered species list since 1996. "There is still hope," Dr Rode-Margono said, "If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them.” A captive breeding program has been established to ensure these less than beautiful beasts survive. "For me, they are not ugly they are beautiful. And everything in our ecosystem is connected, every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen." These unsightly swine play an important ecological role to the tropical forests they are native too. Not only do they till the soil by rooting for insects, but they spread seeds and clear brush to allow young saplings to take root. Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us. Many of us can vividly recall a multimillion-dollar CGI scene depicting a city being leveled by a direct impact, or the resulting thousand-foot- high tsunami wiping any and all traces of human civilization from its path. If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth. Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds. "We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light. "That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability. It is believed by many scientists that this terrestrial planet was once more habitable than it is today. Some have speculated that there may have been life on Mars billions of years ago while others are not ruling out the likelihood that life may still exist there right now. In recent years, experts in astrobiology, equipped with their ever-increasing knowledge about the planet and the advanced technology to study it, have become more determined than ever to find proof of life on Mars or, at the very least, some form of verification that it was once habitable. Today, there are various environmental factors being considered to predict the habitability of our neighbor planet but scientists have placed a particularly heavy emphasis in finding evidence on one of them – that is, the presence of liquid water. The surface of Mars currently has an extremely cold climate and is deemed to be too dry for any presence of life to be possible. However, experts believe that there is enough evidence to suggest that the Red Planet was once home to several bodies of water like oceans and lakes. As for how Mars virtually lost its liquid water billions of years ago, the exact answer remains a mystery but it is speculated by some that a cataclysmic event may have been the root cause of it all. The planet is assumed to have lost its magnetic field around 3.8 billion years ago and extreme solar radiation resulted to the evaporation of liquid water in the Marian atmosphere and the escape of water’s hydrogen molecules into space. The theory that Mars may have been very similar to Earth due to the supposed presence of liquid water on the planet in its distant past gave rise to speculations that life might have also evolved on our neighbor planet during this ancient period. And though its surface may be completely devoid of liquid water today, this doesn’t mean that Mars doesn’t have any water at all. Aside from the abundant volume of water ice found in its two polar ice caps, scientists also believe that liquid water is still present on Mars albeit buried in subterranean aquifers. Aquifers are permeable rocks found underground that bear groundwater. On Earth, water stored underground manages to find its way to the surface through natural springs or by pumping. And so, in the case of Mars, scientists believe that should life still exist there today, the chance to unravel this mystery lies in finding where these hidden reservoirs are located now. All this talk of searching for life and water on planet Mars has gone one for many, many years, but how are we actually faring in finding evidence that supports such theories? Have our unmanned space expeditions to the Red Planet yielded any promising results? Have we detected compelling data to say that there was indeed an ancient ocean on Mars? Are we any closer to finding the underground water supply of Mars now more than we were a decade ago? To answer these questions, let’s talk about some of the Mars-related studies published in recent years. In 2012, the European Space Agency revealed that their spacecraft which orbited Mars called Mars Express detected sedimentary deposits on the planets northern plains. To the European researchers, the fact that the Mars Express’s radar detected low-density materials and ice in

His eye soon fell on a statement by Arnold that the objects he sighted "were not circular." Arnold also complained the flying saucer label arose because of a "great deal of misunderstanding" on the part of the reporter who wrote the story up for the Associated Press. Bill Bequette asked him how the objects flew and Arnold answered that, "Well, they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip

These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft's on-board radar. On 30 December 1978, a television crew from Australia recorded background film for a network show of interviews about the sightings. For many minutes at a time on the flight to Christchurch, unidentified lights were observed by five people on the flight deck, were tracked by Wellington Air Traffic Controllers, and filmed in colour by the television crew. One object reportedly followed the aircraft almost until landing. The cargo plane

Nevertheless, most officially investigated UFO sightings, such as from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, have been identified as being due to honest misidentifications of natural phenomena, aircraft, or other prosaic explanations. In early U.S. Air Force attempts to explain UFO sightings, unexplained sightings routinely numbered over one in five reports. However, in early 1953, right after the CIA's Robertson Panel, percentages of unexplained sightings dropped precipitously, usually being only a few percent in any given year. When Project Blue Book closed down in 1970, only 6% of all cases were classified as being truly unidentified. UFOs that can be explained are sometimes termed "IFOs" or Identified Flying Objects.
 5 -9.09901  UFO sightings in outer space are sightings of unidentified flying objects reported by astronauts while in space that they could not explain at the time. These sightings have been claimed as evidence for alien visits by ufologists. Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission. UFO proponents see comments by astronauts or photos processed by NASA as one of the "strongest bodies of evidence" because they are considered to be of high trustworthiness; however, NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Robert F.

["Inheritance of fur coloration is a common trait in mammals, and it is often passed down from generation to generation. This can be seen in many different species, from domestic cats and dogs to wild animals like lions and tigers.\n\nFor example, in domestic cats, the color of a kitten's fur is often similar to that of its mother. This is because fur coloration is an inherited characteristic, meaning that it is passed down from parent to offspring through genes.\n\nIn some cases, the coloration of fur can also be influenced by environmental factors. For example, a cat that is born with a light-colored coat may become darker if it spends most of its time outdoors in the sun. However, the basic coloration of the fur is still determined by genetics.\n\nIn addition to cats and dogs, other mammals also exhibit inherited fur coloration. For example, in lions, the color of a cub's fur is often similar to that of its mother and father. This is because lions have a complex system of inheritance, with multiple genes affecting fur coloration.\n\nOverall, the coloration of fur is a fascinating and complex trait that is passed down from generation to generation through inheritance. By studying the genetics of fur coloration, scientists can gain insights into the evolution of mammals and the role of genetics in shaping their physical characteristics.", 'How can we see that the coloration of fur is an inherited characteristic?How can we see that the coloration of fur is an inherited characteristic?\nA. puppies have soft fur\nB. kittens look like their parents\nC. all mammals are born with fur\nD. baby rats are mostly bald']

  If one or more genes cannot be expressed because of another genetic factor hindering their expression, this epistasis can make it impossible even for dominant alleles on certain other gene-loci to have an effect on the phenotype. An example in dog coat genetics is the homozygosity with the allele "e e" on the Extension-locus making it impossible to produce any other pigment than pheomelanin. Although the allele "e" is a recessive allele on the extension-locus itself, the presence of two copies leverages the dominance of other coat colour genes. Domestic cats have a gene with a similar effect on the X-chromosome.

   Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible. There are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colours. Camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view. Animals use colour to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to

  attacks by startling predators. Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle, confusing a predator's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly. Some animals are coloured for physical protection, with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn, while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation. Finally, animals can be coloured incidentally. For example, blood is red because the haem pigment needed to carry oxygen is red. Animals coloured in these ways can have striking natural patterns. Animals produce colour in both direct and indirect ways. Direct production occurs through the presence of visible coloured cells known as pigment which are particles of coloured material such as freckles. Indirect production occurs by virtue of cells known as

  In cases of co-dominance, the genetic traits of both different alleles of the same gene-locus are clearly expressed in the phenotype. For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers. Heterozygous chickens have a colour described as "erminette", speckled with black and white feathers appearing separately. Many human genes, including one for a protein that controls cholesterol levels in the blood, show co-dominance too. People with the heterozygous form of this gene produce two different forms of the protein, each with a different effect on cholesterol levels.

  The only difference between hair and fur is semantics. Technically, both are made from keratin, which is also the protein that makes up skin, feathers, nails, hooves, claws, and horns. "'The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles,' says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. 'So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it.'"This remains

   Pigments are coloured chemicals (such as melanin) in animal tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), an example of seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In the case of the flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.

  Coat colors range from pure white to solid black and many other variations. Above is a white American Eskimo dog and a black Belgian Shepherd (Groenendael). A Stanford University School of Medicine study published in Science in October, 2007 found the genetics that explain coat colors in other mammals such as in horse coats and in cat coats, did not apply to dogs. The project took samples from 38 different breeds to find the gene (a beta defensin gene) responsible for dog coat color. One version produces yellow dogs, and a mutation produces black. All dog coat colors are modifications of black or yellow. For example, the white in white miniature schnauzers is a cream color, not albinism (a genotype of e/e at MC1R.) Today, dogs exhibit a diverse array of fur coats, including dogs without fur, such as the Mexican Hairless Dog. Dog coats vary in texture, color, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has evolved to describe each characteristic.

   Agouti is a type of fur coloration in which each hair displays two or more bands of pigmentation. As a result, the overall appearance of agouti fur is usually gray or dull brown, although dull yellow is also possible. Agouti fur is characterized by an appearance of being composed of hairs of different colors, separate from definite markings (although agouti can appear in combination with other markings, such as spots, stripes or patches). This effect is caused by different portions of each hair being visible, such that different colors of the hair's banding is seen, despite hairs actually having similar coloration. This effect produces a very distinctive, finely "speckled" appearance similar to "salt and pepper" hair, as well as an iridescent effect very similar to shot silk which causes the overall color to appear to shift subtly depending on the angle of the light or when the animal moves. Agouti fur is the wild type pigmentation for many domesticated mammals. It is a highly recognized characteristic trait of several animals, including many wild canids, wild rabbits, and the namesake agouti.

 1 April 2006: There is substantial evidence that a pregnant mother's exposure to environmental substances can affect her young. Now researchers have uncovered the first direct evidence that maternal exposure to a phytoestrogen in soy can cause lifelong epigenetic changes--that is, changes in gene activity from processes other than changes in the DNA sequence--in mouse offspring [EHP 114:567-572; Dolinoy et al.]. If the findings hold up, there eventually could be repercussions in several important arenas, including recommendations about what pregnant women and infants should eat.
The researchers made their observations in genetically identical yellow mice. The mothers in the test group ate a diet modified to include a concentration of genistein typical of what people eating a high-soy diet would consume, while the control group mothers ate the same food without the genistein. The diets began two weeks before mating and continued through pregnancy and lactation. At 21 days after birth, the offspring were weaned to a stock maintenance diet, which they ate for the rest of the study period.
The researchers assessed offspring coat color and body weight, traits that can vary with methylation (a mechanism in which methyl groups attach to DNA where cytosine bases occur consecutively). The offspring exhibited wide color differences, ranging from yellow to brown, with varying degrees of mottling in between. The researchers found that these differences corresponded closely with methylation in a DNA region upstream of the offspring's Agouti gene, which determines coat color. The 44 genistein-fed offspring were more than twice as likely as the 52 controls to have brown fur and to have much higher methylation, while they were only one-third as likely to have yellow fur and much lower methylation. Animals that had a blend of yellow and brown fur had progressively increased methylation as brown became more dominant.
For weight gain, the brown mice showed by far the least propensity to become overweight. The other groups, with yellow or various combinations of yellow-brown fur, had roughly the same trend toward becoming significantly overweight. The researchers also found that methylation was evident in many parts of the body, including the brain, liver, kidney, and tail.
The team speculates that the ability of genistein to increase DNA methylation provides a plausible explanation for the lower incidence of certain cancers in Asians compared to Westerners. Nevertheless, the pathway by which these changes occurred suggests there could also be significant adverse interactions between genistein and common dietary supplements such as folic acid, which is added to many foods and recommended for pregnant women. Soy-based infant formulas might also be a concern because of the high levels of genistein present in these products. More research is needed to determine if these worrisome possibilities are correct.

  Brindle is a coat coloring pattern in animals, particularly dogs, cattle, guinea pigs, cats, and, rarely, horses. It is sometimes described as "tiger-striped", although the brindle pattern is more subtle than that of a tiger's coat. Brindle typically appears as black stripes on a red base. The stripes are eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and the base is phaeomelanin (red/yellow pigment), so the appearance of those pigments can be changed by any of the genes which usually affect them. - Eumelanin (the pigment making up the stripes) can be affected by: merle (and harlequin), liver, dilution, greying, and recessive red. - Phaeomelanin

['The amount of friction and the speed of an object have a direct relationship. As the speed of an object increases, the amount of friction also increases. This is because the faster an object is moving, the more force is required to stop it or change its direction. Conversely, if an object is moving slowly, less force is required to stop it or change its direction, resulting in less friction.\n\nIn other words, when an object is moving at a high speed, the force of friction is greater than when it is moving at a low speed. This is why it is more difficult to stop a car that is moving quickly than one that is moving slowly.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if an object is moving through a fluid (such as air or water), the amount of friction decreases as the speed increases. This is because the fluid offers less resistance to the object as it moves faster.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between friction and speed is direct, but there are some exceptions depending on the medium through which the object is moving.\n"""\n\n\nIn this passage, the relationship between friction and speed is described as "direct." This means that as the speed of an object increases, the amount of friction also increases. The passage explains that this is because the faster an object is moving, the more force is required to stop it or change its direction.

  vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats. The expression "1 g = 9.807 m/s2" means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes 9.807 metres per second (≡35.304 km/h). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as 9.807 (metres per second) per second, or 9.807 m/s2. For example: An acceleration of 1 g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 km/h for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of

  Force–velocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched – force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum. This intrinsic property of active muscle tissue plays a role in the active damping of joints that are actuated by simultaneously-active opposing muscles. In such cases, the force-velocity profile enhances the force produced by the lengthening muscle at the expense of the shortening muscle. This favoring of whichever muscle returns the joint to equilibrium effectively increases the damping of the joint. Moreover, the strength of the damping increases with muscle force. The motor system can thus actively control joint damping via the simultaneous contraction (co-contraction) of opposing muscle groups.

  at 1 g and is traveling at 35 km/h, it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1 g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105 km/h, can brake to a standstill in three seconds. In the case of an increase in speed from 0 to v with constant acceleration within a distance of s this acceleration is v2/(2s). Preparing an object for g-tolerance (not getting damaged when subjected to a high g-force) is called g-hardening. This may apply to, e.g., instruments in a projectile shot by a gun.

  Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: "violent" or "unnatural motion", such as that of a thrown stone, in the Physics (254b10), and "natural motion", such as of a falling object, in On the Heavens (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address friction. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation  Aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that

 velocity is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's displacement (distance from the original position) ; acceleration is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position. Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called differential equations. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the "time derivative" &mdash; the rate of change over time &mdash; is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in Newtonian physics:  For example, if an object's position on a line is given by  which is constant.

  The speed of light in a fluid is slower than the speed of light in vacuum, and it changes if the fluid is moving along with the light. In 1851, Fizeau measured the speed of light in a fluid moving parallel to the light using an interferometer. Fizeau's results were not in accord with the then-prevalent theories. Fizeau experimentally correctly determined the zeroth term of an expansion of the relativistically correct addition law in terms of V⁄c as is described below. Fizeau's result led physicists to accept the empirical validity of the rather unsatisfactory theory by Fresnel that a fluid moving with respect to the stationary aether partially drags light with it, i.e. the speed is

  In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. If an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase; and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes. In all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, such as frictional forces, will be present, but if they are of negligible magnitude, the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation. In elastic collisions, the kinetic energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy may be converted into thermal energy. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy (dissipation) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule. Many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy, e.g. an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a heat engine converts heat to mechanical energy.

 The effects of representational friction, target size, and memory averaging on memory for vertically moving targets were investigated in a study. The observers watched an animated target moving either upwards or downwards, with variations in size and velocity on different trials. The target appeared in three different conditions: (a) in isolation, (b) sliding along one side of a single larger stationary object, or (c) sliding between two larger stationary objects.

The study found that the displacement, which refers to the difference between the actual and remembered final position of the target, showed specific patterns. Firstly, forward displacement decreased with an increase in implied friction. This suggests that the perception and memory of the target's position were influenced by the perception of resistance or friction during its upward or downward movement.

Secondly, the effect of target size varied depending on the direction of the target's movement. For descending targets, forward displacement increased with increases in target size. On the other hand, for ascending targets, forward displacement decreased with increases in target size. This indicates that the perception and memory of the target's position were influenced by its size, but the direction of movement played a role in the specific effect.

Thirdly, when a larger stationary object was positioned on one side of the target, orthogonal displacement occurred towards that object. In other words, the remembered position of the target had a bias towards the nearby object. However, when there was no object or when objects were present on both sides of the target, orthogonal displacement was close to zero. This suggests that the presence and location of larger stationary objects influenced the perception and memory of the target's position in relation to those objects.

Overall, these findings provide insights into the effects of representational friction, target size, and memory averaging on memory for vertically moving targets. The study supports previous research and speculations regarding these factors and their impact on memory.

  Fish & Geddes state: "Contact with 20 mA of current can be fatal". The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. Death can occur from any shock that carries enough sustained current to stop the heart. Low currents (70–700 mA) usually trigger fibrillation in the heart, which is reversible via defibrillator but is nearly always fatal without help. Currents as low as 30 mA AC or 300–500 mA DC applied to the body surface can cause fibrillation. Large currents (> 1 A) cause permanent damage via burns and cellular damage.

Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Warwick, New York, where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest. The park at first disputed that the electric current caused his death, saying there were no burns on his body, but the coroner responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based electrocution.

  An electrical burn is a burn that results from electricity passing through the body causing rapid injury. Approximately 1000 deaths per year due to electrical injuries are reported in the United States, with a mortality rate of 3-5%. Electrical burns differ from thermal or chemical burns in that they cause much more subdermal damage. They can exclusively cause surface damage, but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result, electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose, and many people underestimate the severity of their burn. In extreme cases, electricity can cause shock to the brain, strain to the heart,

  In the Netherlands in 1746 Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from man-made electricity. By the mid-19th century high-voltage electrical systems came into use to power arc lighting for theatrical stage lighting and lighthouses leading to the first recorded accidental death in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France, touched a 250-volt wire. The spread of arc light–based street lighting systems (which at the time ran at a voltage above 3,000 volts) after 1880 led to many people dying from coming in contact with these high-voltage lines, a strange new phenomenon which seemed to kill instantaneously

 The man experienced a life-threatening heart rhythm called torsades des pointes, which occurs when the heart's two lower chambers beat faster than the upper chambers.
A 60-year-old man came to the emergency department after he passed out in public. According to bystanders, the fall happened so quickly that no one was able to catch him before he hit the ground and sustained a facial injury.
In the ED, he was awake, but the fainting spell caused the man to break his nose. We gave him medication for the pain.
He reported having a fever for several days before his fainting. Blood work and a CT scan were ordered, along with a standard electrocardiogram. Results of the testing indicated the man had an infection, which was in line with his symptoms.
When we returned to his ED room after the testing, the man experienced a life-threatening heart rhythm called torsades de pointes, or “twisting of the points.” This particular type of tachycardia occurs when the heart’s two lower chambers beat faster than the upper chambers. He went into cardiac arrest because of the erratic rhythm in his heart.
His care team quickly administered one electrical shock to his heart and began CPR until his heart returned to its normal rhythm. The team continued to monitor the man closely.
This serious development in symptoms signaled to the doctors that something more than an infection was going on. So what could it be?
We took a closer look at the electrocardiogram and the man’s family history. The man had passed out two other times in a similar situation when he had a fever. Further investigation revealed several members of his family suffered unexplained deaths while young.
We determined that the man had a genetic condition known as long QT syndrome. The QT interval is a measurement on the electrocardiogram used to assess electrical properties of the heart. When it is longer than it should be, the result can be lethal heart rhythms, passing out, and sudden death.
There are three main types of long QT syndrome, each with different triggers. One such trigger is fever, as was the case with this patient. In addition, long QT syndrome is passed on from generation to generation in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that there is a 50 percent chance of passing it along. This explained the unexpected deaths of several of the man’s family members.
The man was treated with beta blockers to prevent abnormal heart rhythms, and an internal cardioverter defibrillator, to restore normal heart rhythm in the event he suffers another life-threatening arrhythmia. We also treated him with antibiotics to clear up a urinary tract infection. He was discharged from the hospital three days later.
Passing out without any warning.
Passing out with fever, from startling noises, during sleep, or with beginning new medications.
Any passing out that appears to bystanders like a seizure.
Family history of unexpected death in otherwise young, healthy people.
The man’s case was unique in that typically it is the younger generation that presents with passing out or sudden death, which leads to genetic testing of the older generations. In this instance, the diagnosis of the entire family was made by looking backward.

  Electrocution is death or severe injury by electric shock, electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from "electro" and "execution", but it is also used for accidental death. The term "electrocution" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred only to electrical execution and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.

  In 1983 and 1984, Wimber said, "I had suffered minor chest pains every four or five months. I suspected they had something to do with my heart but did nothing about them. Nobody, not even Carol, my wife, knew about my condition." In October 1985 while in England he was very tired and had chest pains. His wife insisted he get tested. "I had what doctors later suspected were a series of coronary attacks." The next month his cardiologist confirmed he had a damaged heart and told him that his weight and schedule put him at risk of imminent death. "In 1985 I was away from home for over forty weeks." "All my life," Wimber confessed,

Harlow took charge of the case around 6 p.m.: "You will excuse me for remarking here, that the picture presented was, to one unaccustomed to military surgery, truly terrific; but the patient bore his sufferings with the most heroic firmness. He recognized me at once, and said he hoped he was not much hurt. He seemed to be perfectly conscious, but was getting exhausted from the hemorrhage. His person, and the bed on which he was laid, were literally one gore of blood." Gage was also swallowing blood, which he regurgitated every 15 or 20 minutes.

  and was having trouble breathing. "And then Perryhis eyes looked up to the left which I recognize as a neurological sign and then the heart monitor went flat and the team converged". After 45 minutes the team gave up trying to resuscitate him. Rogue Jay Novella remembered conversations he had had with DeAngelis about his health and diagnosis. "He would basically say he's living his life the way he wants to. It was kind of the subtext was 'cause he knew that he didn't have a lot of time and he was doing everything in his power to just make himself happy."

Through the decades, a cup of clover tea was taken, sipped slowly to treat bronchitis, whooping cough, arthritis, gout, psoriasis and eczema, and as a treatment to soothe chronic cough and a postnasal drip. For the postnasal drip, clover tea was often combined with violet tea (see Violet). The cooled tea was used as a wash or lotion for psoriasis, eczema and sunburn. To make clover tea, take ¼ cup fresh leaves and flowers, pour over this 1 cup of boiling water, leave it to stand for five minutes, then strain. The flowers of the red clover, particularly, are used in anticancer treatments, extracts are used in medicines and in creams for external application in skin cancers, and as both are so easy to grow we need to have them growing in our gardens for frequent cups of health-giving teas. Once used extensively as a treatment for constipation, clover tea is still a favourite country remedy in Europe today, and a cup a day of winter tea made by combining rosehips, dried clover flowers, dried mint and honey, is still taken to ward off winter flu, chills and coughs, just as the medieval monks prepared it.

  terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the solvent. Thus, a

Already research has verified lucerne's excellence in treating menstrual problems, menopause discomfort, particularly hot flushes, hot sweats and heart palpitations during menopause, as it has superb oestrogenic activity. It also contributes to the building up of body strength, energy and vitality – it literally acts like a tonic. The high content of vitamins A, D, E, G and K and iron boost energy levels quickly, and students during exam times find lucerne tablets (available from health shops and chemists) invaluable. Arthritic pains are eased and soothed by lucerne tea and alfalfa sprouts eaten in the daily salad, and a particularly potent energiser, very useful after a debilitating illness, and a pain-relieving tea, can be made by pouring 1 cup of boiling water over ¼ cup fresh lucerne sprigs and flowers and 1 tablespoon of fresh alfalfa sprouts. Stand for three to five minutes, then strain and sip slowly. Any lucerne tea left over can be cooled and watered into an ailing plant. It will quickly revive it and promote new growth. **CAUTION:** Doctors suggest that those suffering from auto-immune diseases should not take lucerne frequently. #### **Lucerne vitality boost tea – liquid energy**

Take ¼ cup of fresh lucerne sprigs with flowers, 3 fresh pennywort leaves, 1 sprig of sacred basil with about 4 leaves on it. Pour over this 1 cup of boiling water.

_Pimpinella anisum_

Anise is a pretty, quick-growing little annual and the whole plant – flowers included – makes a deliciously comforting tea, and the seeds (aniseed) have been treasured through the centuries as a medicine. One of the best digestive herbs, aniseed has been used to treat heartburn, sour belching, wind, colic and nausea. It will quickly ease hiccoughs, dissipate bloating and is a superbly effective antispasmodic, countering and soothing menstrual cramps, spasmodic tight coughing, whooping cough, bronchitis, pneumonia and heat prostration. Many a nursing mother has sipped cups of aniseed tea to increase her breast milk production (which benefits the baby's colic too). **CAUTION:** Do not take anise in any form during pregnancy. New research is finding that anise tea is beneficial in treating frigidity and impotence and for the easing of the menstrual cycle. The ancient Greeks used aniseeds and fresh flowers for pain relief and recorded that aniseed warms, dries, dissolves, facilitates breathing, provokes urine, eases thirst and relieves pain – and modern research verifies this. Make a tea of 2 teaspoons of aniseeds, pour over this 1 cup of boiling water, leave it to stand for four to five minutes, give it a good stir, then either strain and sip slowly, or chew the seeds well with the tea – they are delicious. Alternatively, make a tea of fresh leaves and flowers by steeping ¼ cup of the leaves and flowers in 1 cup of boiling water for three to four minutes. Strain, sweeten with a touch of honey, if liked, and sip slowly.#### **Aniseed and orange winter warmer**

_Pimpinella anisum_

Anise is a pretty, quick-growing little annual and the whole plant – flowers included – makes a deliciously comforting tea, and the seeds (aniseed) have been treasured through the centuries as a medicine. One of the best digestive herbs, aniseed has been used to treat heartburn, sour belching, wind, colic and nausea. The ancient Greeks used aniseeds and fresh flowers for pain relief and recorded that aniseed warms, dries, dissolves, facilitates breathing, provokes urine, eases thirst and relieves pain – and modern research verifies this. Make a tea of 2 teaspoons of aniseeds, pour over this 1 cup of boiling water, leave it to stand for four to five minutes, give it a good stir, then either strain and sip slowly, or chew the seeds well with the tea – they are delicious. Strain, sweeten with a touch of honey, if liked, and sip slowly.#### **Aniseed and orange winter warmer**

  The safety testing of explosives involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and safety in use. It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and

  fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world. Thermal safety testing

  impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the Bruceton analysis and Neyer d-optimal test. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will "go"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells. Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that

  also be performed via differential scanning calorimetry, in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined. Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives: The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is

  Natural explosions can occur for a variety of reasons. Post-mortem explosions, like that of a beached whale, are the result of the build-up of natural gases created by methane-producing bacteria inside the carcass during the decomposition process. Natural explosions which occur while an animal is living may be defense-related. A number of toads in Germany and Denmark exploded in April 2005. The Los Angeles Herald in 1910 reported a duck which exploded after consuming yeast.

  figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.

  In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as tensile testing, finite element analysis (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.

 In an urban gas setting, several factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage. Firstly, the inadvertent human operation can lead to pentane leakage, which is one of the main causes of the explosions. These operations can include accidents, equipment failure, or improper handling of pentane. 

Secondly, excessive leakage of pentane is often the case when an explosion occurs. This means that a large amount of pentane is released into the environment, creating a highly flammable atmosphere. When an ignition source is present, such as sparks or flames, the pentane-air mixture can ignite and cause an explosion.

Thirdly, the concentration of oxygen plays a crucial role in the severity of the explosion. When an explosion occurs, oxygen in the surrounding air is rapidly consumed, leading to a depletion of oxygen supply. This depletion enhances the severity of the explosion because oxygen is necessary for the combustion process. 

Additionally, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) is another important factor. When a pentane explosion occurs, the high temperature generated can cause carbon dioxide (CO2) to react with carbon atoms, forming carbon monoxide through the reaction CO2 + C = 2CO. The sudden rise in carbon monoxide concentration can have harmful effects on humans in the area, as carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and can cause asphyxiation.

In summary, factors that contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage in an urban gas setting include inadvertent human operation, excessive leakage of pentane, depletion of oxygen, and the rise in carbon monoxide concentration. It is important to prevent pentane leakage, ensure proper ventilation, and have safety measures in place to mitigate the risks of such explosions.

 One of the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives is its effectiveness in assessing the heat damage effect of these explosives. The high temperature and destructive power of thermo-baric explosives make it challenging to measure their explosion temperature accurately. However, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system helps overcome this difficulty.

This system calculates the emissivity and true temperature of the explosion flame using a secondary measurement method. By analyzing the emissions across multiple spectrums, it can determine the true temperature of the explosive reaction more accurately. This capability allows for a more precise evaluation of the heat damage caused by thermo-baric explosives.

Furthermore, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system ensures participant safety during the testing process. It accomplishes this through the use of optical fiber sensing technology and a data acquisition system. By combining these technologies, data collection and transmission can occur up to 500 meters away from the explosion site. This remote operation minimizes the risk to participants, as they can maintain a safe distance from the potentially hazardous environment.

In conclusion, the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives include its ability to accurately assess heat damage and its high level of participant safety. The system's simplicity of operation and better application prospects further enhance its usefulness in this context.

 A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.

Classification

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

Primary injuries
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves. Total body disruption is the most severe and invariably fatal primary injury. Primary injuries are especially likely when a person is close to an exploding munition, such as a land mine. The ears are most often affected by the overpressure, followed by the lungs and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal injuries may present after a delay of hours or even days. Injury from blast overpressure is a pressure and time dependent function. By increasing the pressure or its duration, the severity of injury will also increase.

Extensive damage can also be inflicted upon the auditory system. The tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum) may be perforated by the intensity of the pressure waves. Furthermore, the hair cells, the sound receptors found within the cochlea, can be permanently damaged and can result in a hearing loss of a mild to profound degree. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. Therefore, affected individuals can have auditory processing deficits while having normal hearing thresholds. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound.

In general, primary blast injuries are characterized by the absence of external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion.

Secondary injuries
Secondary injuries are ballistic trauma caused by impacts of flying shrapnels and other objects propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma with visible bleeding. At times the propelled object may become embedded in the body, obstructing the loss of blood to the outside. However, there may be extensive blood loss within the body cavities. Secondary blast wounds may be lethal and therefore many anti-personnel explosive devices are designed to generate fast-flying fragments.

Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries as shrapnels generally affect a larger area than the primary blast area, because as debris can easily be propelled for hundreds or even thousands of meters.  Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries.  In other instances, the target provides the raw material for the fragments thrown into surrounding, e.g., shattered glass from a blasted-out window or the glass facade of a building.

Tertiary injuries
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. Children are at particularly high risk of tertiary injury due to their relatively smaller body weight.

Quaternary injuries
Quaternary injuries, or other miscellaneous named injuries, are all other injuries not included in the first three classes. These include flash burns, crush injuries, and respiratory injuries.

Traumatic amputations quickly result in death, unless there are available skilled medical personnel or others with adequate training nearby who are able to quickly respond, with the ability for rapid ground or air medical evacuation to an appropriate facility in time, and with tourniquets (for compression of bleeding sites) and other needed equipment (standard, or improvised; sterile, or not) also available, to treat the injuries. Because of this, injuries of this type are generally rare, though not unheard of, in survivors. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries.  The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast.  Psychiatric injury, some of which may be caused by neurological damage incurred during the blast, is the most common quaternary injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder may affect people who are otherwise completely uninjured.

Mechanism
Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.

Neurotrauma
Blast injuries can cause hidden sensory and brain damage, with potential neurological and neurosensory consequences. It is a complex clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. Blast injuries usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced neurotrauma.

Individuals exposed to blast frequently manifest loss of memory of events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation.

Blast wave PTSD research
   
In addition to known posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas; in early 2018, it was reported by 60 Minutes that neuropathology specialist Dr. Daniel "Dan" Perl had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), discovering a cause-and-effect relationship between IED blast waves and PTSD. Dr. Perl was recruited to the faculty of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as a Professor of Pathology and to establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine mandated by Congress in 2008.

Casualty estimates and triage
Explosions in confined spaces or which cause structural collapse usually produce more deaths and injuries. Confined spaces include mines, buildings and large vehicles. For a rough estimate of the total casualties from an event, double the number that present in the first hour. Less injured patients often arrive first, as they take themselves to the nearest hospital. The most severely injured arrive later, via emergency services ("upside-down" triage). If there is a structural collapse, there will be more serious injuries that arrive more slowly.

=============== After Reranking ===============
 1 1.75105 A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.

Classification

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

Primary injuries
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves. Total body disruption is the most severe and invariably fatal primary injury. Primary injuries are especially likely when a person is close to an exploding munition, such as a land mine. The ears are most often affected by the overpressure, followed by the lungs and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal injuries may present after a delay of hours or even days. Injury from blast overpressure is a pressure and time dependent function. By increasing the pressure or its duration, the severity of injury will also increase.

Extensive damage can also be inflicted upon the auditory system. The tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum) may be perforated by the intensity of the pressure waves. Furthermore, the hair cells, the sound receptors found within the cochlea, can be permanently damaged and can result in a hearing loss of a mild to profound degree. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. Therefore, affected individuals can have auditory processing deficits while having normal hearing thresholds. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound.

In general, primary blast injuries are characterized by the absence of external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion.

Secondary injuries
Secondary injuries are ballistic trauma caused by impacts of flying shrapnels and other objects propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma with visible bleeding. At times the propelled object may become embedded in the body, obstructing the loss of blood to the outside. However, there may be extensive blood loss within the body cavities. Secondary blast wounds may be lethal and therefore many anti-personnel explosive devices are designed to generate fast-flying fragments.

Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries as shrapnels generally affect a larger area than the primary blast area, because as debris can easily be propelled for hundreds or even thousands of meters.  Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries.  In other instances, the target provides the raw material for the fragments thrown into surrounding, e.g., shattered glass from a blasted-out window or the glass facade of a building.

Tertiary injuries
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. Children are at particularly high risk of tertiary injury due to their relatively smaller body weight.

Quaternary injuries
Quaternary injuries, or other miscellaneous named injuries, are all other injuries not included in the first three classes. These include flash burns, crush injuries, and respiratory injuries.

Traumatic amputations quickly result in death, unless there are available skilled medical personnel or others with adequate training nearby who are able to quickly respond, with the ability for rapid ground or air medical evacuation to an appropriate facility in time, and with tourniquets (for compression of bleeding sites) and other needed equipment (standard, or improvised; sterile, or not) also available, to treat the injuries. Because of this, injuries of this type are generally rare, though not unheard of, in survivors. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries.  The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast.  Psychiatric injury, some of which may be caused by neurological damage incurred during the blast, is the most common quaternary injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder may affect people who are otherwise completely uninjured.

Mechanism
Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.

 2 -1.69872 In an urban gas setting, several factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage. Firstly, the inadvertent human operation can lead to pentane leakage, which is one of the main causes of the explosions. These operations can include accidents, equipment failure, or improper handling of pentane. 

Secondly, excessive leakage of pentane is often the case when an explosion occurs. This means that a large amount of pentane is released into the environment, creating a highly flammable atmosphere. When an ignition source is present, such as sparks or flames, the pentane-air mixture can ignite and cause an explosion.

Thirdly, the concentration of oxygen plays a crucial role in the severity of the explosion. When an explosion occurs, oxygen in the surrounding air is rapidly consumed, leading to a depletion of oxygen supply. This depletion enhances the severity of the explosion because oxygen is necessary for the combustion process. 

Additionally, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) is another important factor. When a pentane explosion occurs, the high temperature generated can cause carbon dioxide (CO2) to react with carbon atoms, forming carbon monoxide through the reaction CO2 + C = 2CO. The sudden rise in carbon monoxide concentration can have harmful effects on humans in the area, as carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and can cause asphyxiation.

In summary, factors that contribute to the occurrence and severity of explosions caused by pentane leakage in an urban gas setting include inadvertent human operation, excessive leakage of pentane, depletion of oxygen, and the rise in carbon monoxide concentration. It is important to prevent pentane leakage, ensure proper ventilation, and have safety measures in place to mitigate the risks of such explosions.
 3 -1.94280 One of the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives is its effectiveness in assessing the heat damage effect of these explosives. The high temperature and destructive power of thermo-baric explosives make it challenging to measure their explosion temperature accurately. However, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system helps overcome this difficulty.

This system calculates the emissivity and true temperature of the explosion flame using a secondary measurement method. By analyzing the emissions across multiple spectrums, it can determine the true temperature of the explosive reaction more accurately. This capability allows for a more precise evaluation of the heat damage caused by thermo-baric explosives.

Furthermore, the multi-spectral high temperature measurement system ensures participant safety during the testing process. It accomplishes this through the use of optical fiber sensing technology and a data acquisition system. By combining these technologies, data collection and transmission can occur up to 500 meters away from the explosion site. This remote operation minimizes the risk to participants, as they can maintain a safe distance from the potentially hazardous environment.

In conclusion, the advantages of using a multi-spectral high temperature measurement system for testing the explosion temperature of thermo-baric explosives include its ability to accurately assess heat damage and its high level of participant safety. The system's simplicity of operation and better application prospects further enhance its usefulness in this context.

The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the Bruceton analysis and Neyer d-optimal test. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will "go"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells. Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that

The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined. Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives: The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is
