David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

His first notable score was for Laserblast, which he co-composed with Joel Goldsmith. His score for Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator was lauded by the magazine Music From the Movies, which said, \"Band’s music is dark and direct, creating an intense and eerie atmosphere, but always with a humorous touch.... Surely, Richard Band is unquestionably one of the most underrated composers in the film business.\" He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Gordon's Masters of Horror episode \"Dreams in the Witch House\". Since 2000, Band has done fewer films, though he has scored many episodes of such television shows as Stargate SG-1, Walker: Texas Ranger. He also developed the campaign music for many shows on the WB, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville. In the last 6 years student films The Confession (2011), Head Over Heels (2013), The Bigger Picture (2015) have gone on to be nominated for three Oscars, and the graduation film A Love Story won the 2017 BAFTA for Best Short Animation, the fourth year in a row an NFTS animation has won the category. This marked the sixth time the NFTS had won in this category, more than any other Film School outside of the United States. He created music for Juliet Berto's Havre (1985), Oscar-winner Yōjirō Takita’s We Are Not Alone (1993), three films by Mitsuo Yanagimachi including most recently Who's Camus Anyway? He also wrote the score for the Oscar-nominated and award-winning documentary Cutie and the Boxer (2013) by Zachary Heinzerling. He has composed soundtracks for Hiroyuki Nakano’s art video Issey Miyake Dancing Pleats (1993), the feature film Stereo Future (2000) and in 2008 the two short films Ferris Wheel at 3:03:15 PM, and Seven Samurai.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test. Critics singled out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance \"admirable\", and IGN said she \"stole the show\". Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her co-stars had matured between films, while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for \"under-employing\" Watson's hugely popular character. Watson \n\n Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English actress and activist.

It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin who, along with a regal blue tang named Dory, searches for his missing son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.

There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise. The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization. Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs. After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands. There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. Respiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. After long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms. The build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. The muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity. Aerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction. All of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery. Chronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. It's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. One of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood. Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an \n\nThe ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

An irregular shape heel (calcaneus) can cause the tissue to twist (plantar ligament and Achilles tendon) or a smaller heel bone will put additional stress on tendons and ligaments. Everyone can be affected by heel spurs, however, certain groups of people have an increased risk. People who walk a lot are much more likely to have heel spurs or people who play golf or play tennis. Over-weight people are also more at risk for heel bone spurs as our feet are not designed to carry around extra weight. Major symptoms consist of pain in the region surrounding the spur, which typically increases in intensity after prolonged periods of rest. Patients may not be able to bear weight on the afflicted heel comfortably. A thorough history and physical exam is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of heel spurs and other foot conditions. X rays of the heel area are helpful, as excess bone production will be visible. Podiatric Care for heel spur syndrome may involve keeping the fascia stretched out by performing exercises. This is most often done through an open procedure as any heel spur or bursa can be removed at the same time. If the spur is not removed during the surgery, it will probably be just as successful, as the large spur is not the true problem. Some physicians use an endoscopic approach (EPF) where a small camera aids the physician during surgery with typically smaller incisions on each side of your foot. One out of 10 people has heel spurs, but only 1 out of 20 people (5%) with heel spurs has foot pain. Because the spur is not the cause of plantar fasciitis, the pain can be treated without removing the spur. Anything that can cause the body to rebuild itself can lead to a bone spur. Heel spurs may or may not cause symptoms. Generally, a calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. This surgery is commonly paired with tarsal tunnel release surgery. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot, a tight Achilles tendon, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is unclear if heel spurs have a role in causing plantar fasciitis even though they are commonly present in people who have the condition. The presentation of the symptoms is generally the basis for diagnosis; with ultrasound sometimes being useful if there is uncertainty. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis. For the first few weeks, those affected are usually advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient, physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. Individuals with plantar fasciitis often report their symptoms are most intense during their first steps after getting out of bed or after prolonged periods of sitting. Rare, but reported symptoms include numbness, tingling, swelling, or radiating pain. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the bottom of the foot. Risk factors Identified risk factors for plantar fasciitis include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods, high arches of the feet, the presence of a leg length inequality, and flat feet. Studies consistently find a strong association between increased body mass index and plantar fasciitis in the non-athletic population. This association between weight and plantar fasciitis is not present in the athletic population. Many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis in light of these newer findings. Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers. Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal mechanical movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) place excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity and seem to contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis Plantar fasciitis is usually diagnosed by a health care provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the sole may elicit tenderness during the physical examination. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. Other diagnoses that are typically considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to check for damage to the nerves or muscles. An incidental finding associated with this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), which can be found in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear. Imaging Medical imaging is not routinely needed. In theory, plantar fasciitis becomes more likely as the plantar fascia's thickness at the calcaneal insertion increases. Other imaging findings, such as thickening of the plantar aponeurosis, are nonspecific and have limited usefulness in diagnosing plantar fasciitis. Three-phase bone scan is a sensitive modality to detect active plantar fasciitis. Furthermore, a 3-phase bone scan can be used to monitor response to therapy, as demonstrated by decreased uptake after corticosteroid injections. A determination about a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis can usually be made based on a person's medical history and physical examination. When a physician suspects a fracture, infection, or some other serious underlying condition, they may order an X-ray to investigate. X-rays are unnecessary to screen for plantar fasciitis for people who stand or walk a lot at work unless imaging is otherwise indicated. Affected people use many treatments for plantar fasciitis. There is evidence that corticosteroid injections may reduce pain for up to one month after the injection, which can have an impact on the formation of calcaneal spurs. Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity. There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts. While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan. In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines. Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot. Spurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the \"bowstring-like\" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel. Not all heel spurs cause symptoms. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily. The load is softened by a pillow of fat under the heel and a large sinew under the sole of the foot. When the muscles of the calf or Achilles tendon are overloaded there will be extra strain on the sinew and muscles in the soles of the foot. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. But it is not the spur itself that causes the pain. Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective. People who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on. Once a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months. Prevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis. It must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The book initially had trouble finding a stable creative team. A writer/penciller team would complete no more than three issues in a row until Jeph Loeb and Ian Churchill began work on issue #20 and finish on #35 (though with a gap between issues #20 and #21 due to the Age of Apocalypse event). Loeb and Churchill provided the first instance of stability, working together on 15 of the 20 issues from #20–39. During their run, they explored characters in Cable's past, his feeling of responsibility toward Nathan Grey, his relationship with Domino and Blaquesmith, and further adventures with Kane, the Sugar Man, and the Microverse. In 2014 and 2015, Fernández illustrated the nine-issue limited series The Names, written by Peter Milligan and published by Vertigo. He's done work most notably for First Comics, Marvel Comics, and DC Comics. The bulk of his comic work doing pencils was with the writer Mike Baron. At DC Comics he has done inking on comic series Challengers of the Unknown, The Book Of Fate, Batman, \n\n (the lowest issue score going to issue #7, with 5.3, and the highest going to issue #1, with 8.7), it was criticized for its use of sexual violence as a plot device, for retconning events in DC continuity that critics and readers felt harmed the characterization of long-standing DC heroes,  and for influencing similar subsequent comics. Meltzer scripted pages 11–12 and 19 of the comic book.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

As a response to that, the album includes a new collaboration with Crystal Kay, symbolizing that the \"Loves\" series started and ends with her. It was not announced what direction the band would take after this release, though the band stated in an interview that it would not disband. The DVD contains the videos for the songs \"Summer Time Love\", \"Lotta Love\", \"Love Song\" and \"She Loves the Cream\", a DVJMIX by DJ Uppercut (a music video remix) and a feature titled \"History of M-Flo\", which is a mix of their previous works. The limited press edition of the CD+DVD format also has two performances by M-Flo member Verbal and past member, Lisa at Rhythm Nation: \"Come Again\" and \"Been So Long\". Kimura had a collaboration with DJ Hello Kitty for a seven-hour livestream. She was later first recognized by the gyaru style from her song 'GAL-TRAP'. She is currently producing music. Western music has also seen \n\n Kanjani8 from being seen on camera, angering fans of Kanjani8 by her outrageous fashion style. She later stated that when she is being interviewed on television, she would restrict what she is wearing. Kyary's fans, however, defended her wearing the outfit. Kyary has since released five full-length albums: Pamyu Pamyu Revolution (2012), Nanda Collection (2013), Pika Pika Fantajin (2014), Japamyu (2018), and Candy Racer (2021).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.
