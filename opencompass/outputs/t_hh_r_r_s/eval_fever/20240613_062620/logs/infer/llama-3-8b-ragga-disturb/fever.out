 I remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.  I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us. According to the Bible, a giant storm sent by God flooded the Earth. Noah and his family and the animals entered the Ark, and "the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows

I saw them chopping off our neighbor Wasylkowska's head on a stump. My screams were so terrifying that one of the Banderites walked up to me and stabbed me with a knife just below my throat, but I didn't stop crying. I was paralyzed with fear.

Another one of the Banderites grabbed me by the skin on my back like a cat, and cut off that part of my skin in his hand. Then he stabbed me again twice in my shoulder blades and threw me into a huge ant nest. I fainted and when I came around I was in great pain, and the ants stung me so hard that my body swelled up.

Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is currently defined as a ‘syndrome’, a collection of symptoms for which the root cause has not yet been identified. I argue the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system. The limbic system is the primitive 'flight or fight' part of the brain which is also the start of the entire autonomic nervous system.
I argue that this neurological injury is best conceived of as a state of 'hard-wired crisis' following an antecedent trauma. The traumas that lead to such a crisis state are varied and can include a viral illness, pregnancy, surgery or psychological trauma (or a combination of different kinds of trauma) - in short any kind of event that the autonomic nervous system might 'register' as traumatic.
I believe that limbic system dysfunction is also responsible for many 'knock on' (or 'secondary') health effects on the body and that it can explain many aspects of pre-existing scientific research into POTS including: NET protein deficiency (which is responsible for blood vessel constriction problems and resulting elevated heart rate upon standing), low aldosterone and poor sodium retention (which are primarily responsible for low blood volume problems) and mast cell activation problems (which are responsible for the excessive release of histamine in many POTS patients). I spell out why I believe limbic system dysfunction can cause all of these problems (and more) in detail in the book and on my Youtube channel. As the limbic system is also the part of the brain which processes stimuli, the limbic system dysfunction theory can also explain why many POTS patients are sensitive to stimuli including light, sound and smell.
If it is correct that POTS is caused by a limbic system impairment, then a potentially effective treatment exists in the form of the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), an intensive six month, neuroplasticity based, limbic system rehabilitation programme. The DNRS program was originally created by Annie Hopper to treat another neurological injury to the limbic system called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), a condition in which the smell centres of the brain (which are rooted in the limbic system) enter a state of chronic hyper vigilance following (usually) an initial dangerous chemical exposure. The DNRS program was later found to be effective, however, for those with POTS as well as MCS, thereby pointing to a possible shared neurological origin.
I myself recovered from POTS by following the DNRS program. I am now setting about systematically gathering evidence of others who have recovered from POTS as a result of following the DNRS. Below you will find both written and video testimonials of recovery.
Research by the Universities of Calgary and Alberta into the DNRS program and its effectiveness for a range of other limbic system conditions (Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) is soon to get under way. This study will also include POTS, thereby testing the limbic system impairment hypothesis.
The DNRS program can either be taken as part of an intensive five day in-person program or via a DVD programme. You can find out more information about you can obtain the DNRS program below.

Blurb: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is currently defined as a ‘syndrome’, a collection of symptoms for which the root cause has not yet been identified. This book aims to rectify this by arguing the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system following an antecedent trauma, such as a viral illness, pregnancy, surgery or psychological trauma (or a combination). Patrick Ussher himself had POTS but recovered by following a limbic system rehabilitation program (originally developed to treat Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) called the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS). After recovery, he set about mapping the idea of a limbic system impairment onto pre-existing research into POTS and found that it could explain many key findings including: NET protein deficiency (which is responsible for blood vessel constriction problems and resulting elevated heart rate upon standing), low aldosterone and poor sodium retention (which are responsible for low blood volume problems) and mast cell activation problems. This book will simultaneously act as a guide for those interested in using the DNRS as a treatment for POTS and also as a call for further research into the potential efficacy of the DNRS for treating POTS.
Patrick Ussher followed the Dynamic Neural Retraining System, an intensive six-month limbic system rehabilitation program, to recover from POTS. After he recovered, he set about mapping the idea of POTS as a form of limbic system impairment onto pre-existing scientific research into the condition, to see if it could be the ‘missing link’ which could explain the root cause of the condition. The book (POTS: What It Really Is & Why It Happens) and Youtube channel are the results of that research. He is pictured right with Annie Hopper, founder of the DNRS, at the Institute for Functional Medicine's Conference on Neuroplasticity in June 2017.
Patrick was also part of the Stoicism Today project from its inception in 2012 until 2016, a collaboration of academics and psychotherapists which provided modernised Stoic resources, based on the ancient Greco-Roman philosophy as a way of life. Patrick contributed to the development of three ‘International Stoic Weeks’ (2012-2014), which were widely featured in the media including on BBC Radio, and in newspapers such as The Guardian, Forbes and The Telegraph. Patrick founded and edited the blog for the Stoicism Today project and has edited two books Stoicism Today: Selected Writings (Volumes One & Two). Patrick has a BA and MA in Classics from the University of Exeter, U.K.
The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS) is a six month limbic system rehabilitation program that treats the root cause of a range of health conditions that are arguably caused by limbic system impairment following a trauma, broadly understood. Those conditions include Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Electro-Magnetic Hypersensitivity, Fibromyalgia, Food Sensitivities, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, among others. Many who take the program have more than one of these conditions and yet find the program effective for the range of conditions they may be suffering from.
The program was developed by Canadian Annie Hopper who devised it to recover from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Sensitivities and Fibromyalgia. The program was later found to work for other conditions, including POTS. It is available in a DVD series and also in in-person programs.
You can find more about the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS) and their DVD or In-Person Seminar Programs here.

Lauren Dinkel developed POTS after contracting mononucleosis at the age of 19. She had POTS for over four years before she found the DNRS. In the last of those four years, her condition had deteriorated to the point that she could not stand up at all, was in a ‘tilt-in-space’ wheelchair, in constant pain and unable to eat more than a handful of foods. Her heart rate in a supine position was around 135 BPM. Light and sound would give her migraines. Lauren’s hair had begun to fall out, she had become skin and bones, and she had lost all hope. Her mitochondrial cell function was on the level of an elderly woman. Her family tried everything. Lauren visited over 35 specialists and countless alternative medical practitioners, and her parents spent over $100,000 outside of their medical insurance in trying to find the answer to their daughter’s suffering. POTS was not the only condition Lauren was diagnosed with. She was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Sleep Disorders (including atypical narcolepsy), Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome along with Mast Cell Activation Problems, Movement Disorder and Non-Epileptic Seizures, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety.
Brittney was sick for four years. She was diagnosed with Lyme disease, POTS/dysautonomia, MCS, EMF, food allergies, PTSD, anxiety disorders and depression. She saw neurologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, naturopaths and other alternative practitioners. She had a team of medical support and extended family support which meant that there was someone with her 24/7. At the worst of her illness, she did not see the outside of her house for over a year and a half. She spent over $300,000 in pursuing different treatments, some of which helped a bit but some of which also made her condition much worse. She was in tremendous pain, unable to stand, and she would go into convulsions if she attempted to walk. Interestingly, from the point of view of this book’s hypothesis, she felt that her nervous system was ‘constantly firing off’. She also had blurry vision and was unable to eat more than five particular foods for over 18 months. Her condition deteriorated to the point where any treatment or supplement might send Brittney to the emergency room.
Brittney ordered the DNRS DVDs having heard about Lauren’s website. Within the first three to four days of practicing the program, her mood improved, and she no longer felt so ‘stuck’. After several weeks, she was able to walk again, and she also gradually expanded her diet, gaining 15 pounds over six months. At that point, she attended the DNRS in-person workshop travelling on her own, reporting that her chemical sensitivity was ‘completely gone’. She even had her first glass of wine in five years! She is now getting her life back, as she puts it, ‘in ways I could never have imagined’.
Another powerful DNRS video testimonial of recovery from POTS and other limbic system impairments.
In this interview, the first in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Lindsay about her recovery. Lindsay's written testimonial ('My Completely Normal Tilt-Table Test') can be found below.
In this interview, the second in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Jared about her recovery.
Jared was in a wheelchair for a whole year at the worst of her struggles with POTS, which she developed following exposure to mold. She also had severe mast cell activation problems. With the exception of eight foods which she could eat, any other food would lead to severe reactions. She also had chemical sensitivity and electro-magnetic hypersensitivity. In this interview, she shares with us the worst of her illness and how she got better by following the DNRS program.
In this interview, I talk with Nick from New Zealand who had POTS for a period of 18 months before recovering using a brain rewiring program known as 'The Switch'. We cover the symptoms he experienced, the triggering trauma, and the recovery process that unfolded following retraining the primitive part of his brain that had been affected by the initial trauma. His standing heart rate at its highest when he had POTS was 150 and just before this interview it was 82.
In this interview, Michelle shares her story of POTS recovery using the limbic system retraining program The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS).
Before developing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, I lived an active life as an actress. I grew up performing in plays and went to get my B.F.A. in Musical Theatre from the University of Central Florida. After college, I worked on two internships before beginning to work professionally. This is around the time when my life began to shift.
The first time I had clear symptoms of POTS was after a bacterial stomach infection at the age of 22. I was still highly functioning, but could tell something was off. If I stood for too long, I would develop diarrhea. Around Summer 2012 I went to a cardiologist because I was having symptoms of a fast heart rate and skipped beats. They noticed tachycardia on a three-day monitor and decided I most likely had mild Supraventricular Tachycardia. They put me on a beta-blocker and called it a day. They said if I had any additional problems with it in the future, that they would recommend an Electrophysiology study to ablate the fast rhythm.
All was well, until a year later when I was checking out New York City to see if I wanted to live there. It was there that I came down with a sinus infection that I couldn’t shake. After returning home to Florida, I went to a doctor for my sinus infection and they prescribed antibiotics. After completing the dosage, I noticed I was developing bumps all over my skin and my sinus infection still wasn't healing. I went back to the doctor and they prescribed additional antibiotics. It didn’t clear again (it wouldn’t clear for another two years).
This is where my POTS journey truly begins. Gradually, I started losing the ability to function. I start having “attacks” where my pulse would rise to over 200 BPM with no clinical reason why. My cardiologist suggested it was time to ablate the “Supraventricular Tachycardia” and ordered an Electrophysiology study.
I walked in to have the Electrophysiology study on June 26, 2013. Moments before I was put under, attached to a heart monitor, IV, and a defibrillator, I followed my intuition and told the doctor that it wasn't just intermittent attacks anymore. My pulse was elevating now EVERY TIME I stood up. He thought for a quick moment and reconsidered the procedure. However, he then decided that, since we were here, we might as well proceed.
I counted down from ten and woke up asking if they had cured me. I sobbed when my parents informed me that there was nothing to be found. I didn’t have Supraventricular Tachycardia, but the doctor suggested he might know what it was. He would test me in a few days for an official diagnosis. Upon first standing to take a stroll around the cardiac unit, still being monitored by the cardiac unit nurse, my pulse rose to 160BPM.
A few days later, I had an abnormal Tilt-Table test. My doctor suggested that I go to Vanderbilt in Tennessee to be diagnosed because he said he did not know enough about the condition he thought it was. He said I most likely had something called Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and there wasn’t much either he or anyone locally could do for me. His hope was that I would “grow out of it”.
I wouldn’t be formally diagnosed until a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville during 2014. The results of my tilt table test were 69 BPM resting heart rate and 125 BPM tilted. The doctor would incorrectly diagnose me with the wrong subset of POTS. I wouldn’t find out I had “Hyperadrenergic POTS” until a year later.
I lost the ability to function. I lost the ability to go outside. I lost the ability to eat the things I wanted to eat or feel the emotions I wanted to feel because it all made me sick. Everything was a risk. Everything could "cause" sickness. Every time I went outside, I would overheat. I was constantly drinking tons of water with very little retention. I would go days without sleep. There were many trips to the hospital with no concrete answers. I lost the ability to be whole.
I couldn't work. I couldn't ... you name it. Everything changed. After hysterical emergencies and no clue how to address my situation, my desperate mother considered the thought that maybe I needed to be placed somewhere else. Somewhere I could be taken care of. This never came to fruition, but I want you to see the magnitude of my isolation, of my illness, and the situations I have been faced with.
One year after that tilt table test, we decide to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, because somewhere deep inside I knew that my diagnosis was incomplete. I was right. This is where I was diagnosed with Hyperadrernergic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome as well as Preganglionic Anhidrosis. Turns out I was not sweating. Only a very tiny patch of skin on my chest registered as sweating on the test. No wonder I was having heat strokes, living in sunny Florida.
The doctors suggested that there wasn’t much to be “done”. There was no magic pill to cure me. The adrenalin would cause me to feel hot at all times and, coupled with my inability to sweat, my temperature regulation system was confusing. The doctor said I would need to pay special attention to the thermometer in a room because I wouldn’t naturally be able to tell if I was over heating or not as I would “feel” hot from the adrenalin anyway. This was my own personal hell.
They suggested deep breathing could help change, what they thought, was an injury to my brain. My ‘fight or flight’ mechanism was switched to “ON” and this was causing a cascade of symptoms. Turn it “OFF” and I could heal, they suggested. The methods they suggested were biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy. They didn’t provide a detailed way of how to do this, though.
When you reach a certain level of illness, you start reaching out to anyone you believe can help you. To me, I began to reach in the direction of Spirituality by seeing intuitive healers.
That’s how I discovered the Dynamic Neural Retraining System.
While getting a psychic reading, the intuitive “received” this program. She said she had a friend who had just completed it and that it could help me. I had not told this woman the specifics or name of my condition, so when I looked at the DNRS website and saw that one of the conditions it treated was POTS, I took it as a sign. I bought it around October 2015.
I started the program and noticed my symptoms healing. Bit by bit, I was making changes. I could stand longer, smells and foods weren’t bothering me as much, my face wasn’t flushing, I didn’t feel as hot.
I started going out more, reading books, watching TV and videos (I could hardly do that before because it would spike too much adrenalin). I was normalizing bit by bit.
One year later, I went back to the Mayo Clinic, this time in Florida, for an annual checkup. I didn’t need a wheel chair, where a year earlier I had to be pushed around the large hospital to make it.
On the tilt table test, my pulse started at 61 BPM and rose to 86 BMP. Normal. They all came back normal. I still have Anhidrosis, but my POTS? Normal results.
I told them about how DNRS had healed me and they listened with polite skepticism. “Interesting” they nodded without taking down the details of the program or asking additional questions. I felt written off.
I wouldn’t have the life I have today without the Dynamic Neural Retraining System. While the hospital I visited was on the right track about healing from POTS, they were unable to tell you HOW. They could simply recommend deep breathing, which is helpful, but doesn’t come close to what DNRS offers.
Changing my diet, exercising and meditation did help me, but nothing healed me more than DNRS.
Today, I can live a free life, whereas before, I was bed bound for around two years. I still have Anhidrosis, but even that is improving: my body contains the ability to sweat, it simply needs to “turn on” again. I am still hopeful to make a full recovery in that respect, as my doctors believe it is highly possible and probable. Either way, I am not disabled anymore from POTS, thanks to DNRS and so my quality of life has improved 10-fold.
I am not tired all the time, I can stand and walk for prolonged periods of time, I can wait in lines, I can do gentle yoga, I can cook, I can… you name it. I’m free. I won’t be running a marathon, or performing high intensity aerobics, but that’s because of the Anhidrosis. I am recovered from POTS. It feels so good to walk around the block, go to the grocery store, and work from home. These activities would be impossible without the DNRS. I am forever grateful for this program and all the healing it has given me. It was the only thing that worked.
My advice to those with POTS considering DNRS? Let me leave you with a little analogy. You are a ship in the ocean and your ship has a hole on the bottom. Right now, all the tools you are using, such as eating more salt, drinking more fluids, medication, etc., are equivalent to you taking a bucket and scooping the water out of your sinking ship. It will never get all the water out and it is not a permanent fix. It will never heal you. DNRS is the equivalent of patching up the hole in your boat. You are healing the foundation, the root cause of your illness and this is permanent and lasting change. It is possible and it does work. Happy sailing!
Lindsay Clemmons had been disabled with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome for three years before discovering the Dynamic Neural Retraining System. Once an active performer of musicals and plays, Lindsay was left bed bound and confused with no sign of hope. After completing the Dynamic Neural Retraining System, Lindsay stunned doctors at the Mayo Clinic with "normal" results on her Tilt Table Test, where a year prior she had been formally diagnosed. Lindsay had felt the difference since completing the program, but the results were the icing on the cake. She knew she had the Dynamic Neural Retraining System to thank for this change. Now vastly improved and able to live a free life, Lindsay feels passionate about sharing her experience with those suffering from a Limbic System trauma. She feels grateful to contribute to Patrick Ussher's important work, as she is hopeful this will bring awareness to the POTs community about the importance and potential for complete healing through Neural Retraining.
I was officially diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) in 2014 although I had been experiencing symptoms for over 18 months prior to diagnosis.
I had been a very fit, active person up until 2011 when I contracted several tick borne infections which left me extremely unwell. I was bedbound, in horrific pain with sensitivity to both sound and light due to severe neurological involvement. My heart was affected, as were my kidneys, musculoskeletal system and gastrointestinal tract.
It became clear after some time on treatment for the tick borne diseases (TBD) that my autonomic nervous system had also been affected. I was weak and dizzy, had poor sleep, headaches, experienced prolonged episodes of heart palpitations and when I stood up my heart would race for a long time afterwards. Neurological assessments confirmed a diagnosis of POTS in addition to the TBDs. It was suspected that the catalyst for developing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was one or all of the tick borne infections.
My day-to-day life at this stage was very challenging. The severe fatigue that I was experiencing dramatically affected what I could do. Movements and transitions from lying down to standing had to be carried out very slowly. I would often need to lie down very suddenly or I would faint. I was experiencing other symptoms related to the TBDs but although these began to improve with treatment, the POTS symptoms worsened and were hugely debilitating. Heat exacerbated the symptoms as did my menstrual cycle.
To support my autonomic nervous system I adjusted my diet, paced my activity and planned things as best as I could. I used lifts and escalators. I spent long periods lying down. Limiting stress was easier said than done as the TBD treatment was very hard and I was unable to work so there was a great deal of financial stress. My friends and family fundraised and most of my energy was put into researching TBDs which resulted in me going to see an infectious disease specialist in the USA about 2 years after I was infected. I saw good improvements across the board on the new medication regimen but remained severely fatigued with brain fog, palpitations, insomnia and anxiety.
A friend of mine forwarded me a recording of a lecture that Annie Hopper had given to the AAEM (American Association of Environment Medicine) in October 2013 regarding limbic system rehabilitation. As a scientist I was intrigued by the possibility that with certain exercises the limbic system could recover. I listened to the lecture and it became more obvious that many of the clinical signs I was experiencing, including all those grouped under the diagnosis of POTS, could be linked to a limbic system impairment. The same friend went on to start the six month Dynamic Neural Retraining System program and, after witnessing her success with it, I decided to take the plunge.
I opted for the DVD program and I began this in October 2015. To be honest, although I was convinced that I had a limbic system impairment, I was still very sceptical that what appeared to be a very simple program would help. Of course, the DNRS recovery program is actually a big commitment despite its simplicity and rewiring your brain takes much perseverance. Nothing ventured, nothing gained and, as there really was nothing to lose, I opted to participate fully. I wrote to friends and family and explained to them what I was doing and why. I guided them as to how they could support me in the process. I also joined the DNRS forum which was incredibly helpful as I no longer felt like I was on my own: there were others who had progressed in their training and were having great successes.
It was difficult at first to balance the needs of my TBD doctor (who wanted regular updates and daily symptom charts) with the prinicples of the DNRS. This is where I opted to seek support from Christine, one of the DNRS coaches whose family had recovered using DNRS. I think I spoke to her a couple of times over the initial six month period of training.
I was very fortunate in that the oppressing fatigue that I had been living with over the previous 3 years lifted very quickly. I couldn’t believe it and neither could my husband! This was such a huge change for me that it encouraged me to continue and I am so grateful that I saw such positive change so early on as some of the other symptoms were a little more persistent! In any event, I practised as directed for at least an hour a day, reinforced my attitude of gratitude, practised additionally when feeling challenged and learnt to recognise the pathways my brain had previously focused on and confronted them.
Looking back on my recovery process now is such a joy! Within three weeks of starting the DNRS program, I stood in front of fifty academics and presented a lecture about tick borne disease. No problems with dizziness or fatigue. Three months after starting DNRS I drove on my own for 4 hours and stayed with a friend whom I had not seen in four years due to my being essentially housebound. Five months later I was camping with my husband and attended a festival – no longer imprisoned by noise sensitivity and weakness. Eleven months after beginning the program I had started jogging, gone on a holiday with my friends and had work shadowed for a week to assess my capabilities. It is actually quite emotional to revisit these triumphs and I am hugely indebted to Hayley, my friend who brought the DNRS to my attention, and Annie Hopper who developed it in the first place.
My postural orthostatic tachycardia symptoms are almost all gone. I continue to work with the sleep disturbance and some residual effects of some of the tick borne diseases. I should note that after 12 months I stopped my regular hour a day DNRS practice but I am re-inspired by undertaking this review to get back into it to shift those last few TBD issues.
My days now compared to how they were when I started DNRS are very different. I walk, drive, food shop, do household chores and hobbies every day. I make plans to see friends and go places. I no longer have to worry that I’ll need somewhere to lie down to recover. I don’t plan around fatigue. Strong scents, noise and light cause me no problems.
Yes, DNRS takes commitment but the value of this program cannot be underestimated. Go for it!

For me, POTS syndrome developed over quite some time, starting out insidiously before exploding in full force in February 2015. In that sense, my case was one of occasional traumatic triggers over a longer period of time, each leading to a lower tolerance to stress, finally culminating in a ‘perfect storm’ which tipped my limbic system into full crisis.
Since my teenage years, I was very driven, with a typical ‘type-A personality’. As such, I often overworked, excelling at university but the cost was not, in hindsight, worth it. This overwork tended to lead to minor health problems and I was often tired. I had also been quite anxious, off and on, since 2007 when at the age of 18, I had experienced a devastating emotional trauma. But all that time was fairly manageable for the most part and it seems fair to say that significant limbic system related impairment began for me after a serious car accident in 2011, which I was very lucky to survive but from which I developed Post-Traumatic Stress. After the car accident, life became much more difficult. In addition to flashbacks, nightmares and intense hyper vigilance during any car journey, I also experienced a degree of cognitive impairment. My memory became poor and sometimes I felt curiously ‘vacant’ and cold, as if I were not really present. Rather than ‘accept defeat’ (as it seemed to me then), I ploughed on, doing well in my work, or at least so it seemed from the outside. At this point, interestingly, I found that techniques like mindfulness which had previously helped me in coping with the stresses of life no longer had much of an effect. It was not powerful enough to deal, as I now understand it, with a traumatised limbic system.
From the time of the car accident, health problems related to limbic system impairment grew steadily. Suddenly, I could no longer put on weight no matter how much I ate. I often looked run down. I started to become tired easily and struggled to do a full day’s work. My body started to ache consistently and to feel tender. I started to have a sensitive stomach. Over this period, I practised CBT intensively, as I recognised that I was very hypervigilant following the car accident, and that this hypervigilance was only getting worse. To its credit, the CBT did help with coping and did reduce the distress I felt to some extent, but overall the trajectory continued in a negative direction. Friends and family had little idea of what was going on inside of me at this time as from the outside I did not appear to be struggling.
Towards the end of 2014, things suddenly took a turn for the worse. I became dizzy, and my limbs – especially my legs – often felt ‘heavy’, in a way that was worrying. I started to have allergic, (I now suspect) mast-cell reactions to certain foods, reactions which would leave me in bed, feeling overheated and as if my ‘body did not work’, for several hours at a time. In the background, I had started to notice that there was a light, if constant, release of adrenalin. It was also around this time that I became somewhat sensitive to chemicals, although as my sensitivity was mild by standards (at that point), I merely thought that manufacturers had started to make chemicals more powerful than usual.
The final ‘tipping’ point occurred in February 2015 with the news that my mother was going into palliative care. Although the rational part of my mind could accept this last situation, and was prepared to face it in the best possible way, it actually felt like another part of my brain – the primitive part – had exploded. The adrenalin release became extreme with waves of it washing over me every seven seconds. Interestingly, however, this did not feel like a panic attack. Rather, it felt like an intense physical explosion that was perpetually running itself ‘in the background’. My rational mind could see things quite clearly, and indeed I had a philosophical acceptance of the news and a determination to be at my mum’s side to make her last days as beautiful as possible, but some deep part of me had entered a crisis state and was stuck there. This, as it turns out, is a pretty accurate description of what was actually happening. Although I am not sure, I also feel that I had some kind of viral infection at this time, which probably also contributed to the ‘final storm’.
I returned to Dublin for the two months leading up to my mum’s death in April 2015. Those two months, although they contained blessed moments with her which I will always cherish, were nightmarish. The flight home had further exacerbated my health. My legs now felt like ‘jellied concrete’, heavy appendages that were part of a body that no longer felt my own. At times, I had blurry vision and was very sensitive to motion. Car journeys felt truly bizarre. I was often faint both sitting and standing. My sensitivities to smell, in particular perfumes and exhaust fumes, increased significantly. The reactions to food also worsened. I had rather distressing ‘hypnagogic jerks’ at night, sometimes fifty in quick succession, which prevented me from sleeping. But what I found most difficult was that I was not well enough to visit my mum as often as I desperately wanted to. One journey into the hospital to see her would knock me sideways for days to come.
In the days following her passing in early April, I developed a quiet determination that, somehow, I was going to get better. For by then I was fairly certain what the problem was: all the evidence was pointing to POTS syndrome. I had ordered a HR and BP monitor a few weeks after returning home, and had found that I consistently met the criterion of plus 30 beats per minute upon standing, with a standing heart-rate of at least 120 and often 130 or more. I read nearly every article on POTS that I could find. It is important to mention that despite my own certainty that I had POTS, I was never officially diagnosed as having the condition. I did have a tilt-table test in Dublin in mid-April but this did not actually test me for POTS syndrome but for whether or not I fainted upon standing (I asked the person performing the test if he knew how to test for POTS and he just looked at me blankly – he’d never heard of it). My GP felt it likely I had POTS however and had arranged for me to see Dublin’s one POTS consultant in June. That appointment would have led to a proper test but I postponed that appointment as I had already started to make strides in recovery using the DNRS such that it seemed unnecessary to become entangled in the medical system at that point.
I had become aware of the DNRS as a result of my frantic online research, initially through Lauren Dinkel’s website (wheelchairtorollerblades.com). I was highly sceptical of the DNRS. In fact, the thought once crossed my mind that it was all an elaborate hoax! I was more focussed at that point on following the Levine protocol and a healthy diet, and was unsure how a ‘mind-body’ program (as it seemed to me then) could possibly help me even though I had started to suspect the problems I had were brain related. More specifically, as I was already well versed in CBT and mindfulness, and as I was employing both intensively at that time, I did not think the DNRS would contain anything new that could really make a difference.
Furthermore, although I was determined to get better, part of me really could not see how it was possible to recover from the position I was in. But I thought I’d give it a go since I had nothing to lose and the online testimonials of ex-POTS patients who recovered following the DNRS were, on the face of it, extraordinary. These were people who had recovered from a much worse situation than I was in. So I ordered it.
I started the DNRS on May 11th,. I remember the result of that first morning’s practice very well. It was as if the doors of my senses had opened – everything became bright and vivid. During the session itself, I remember thinking ‘I was wrong, this program is different’. I felt excited as if I were discovering something very precious, although I was also afraid in case it might not work. I need not have worried. One week after starting the program, what could only be described as a miracle (as it seemed to me, at least!) happened: the constant release of adrenalin stopped. My nervous system had quietened down, after just seven days! This is important as, in the months previous, I had practised meditation intensively often for up to four hours a day. But meditation on its own had not been powerful enough to ‘switch off’ the adrenalin. I know now that this is because the DNRS speaks to the limbic system ‘in its own language’, whereas meditation aims more to observe what is occurring in the limbic system from a distance, albeit compassionately. The latter is a wonderful life skill, but it is arguably inappropriate for those suffering with severe limbic system impairment for whom the focus should instead be on changing the limbic system deliberately in positive directions.
At the same time as the adrenalin stopped, my legs started to feel lighter. On day 8, I went for a walk. Up until that point, I had really struggled with walking more than 10 minutes per day, but on that day I marvelled at my body as I walked up a small hill near where I lived at that time. Were these really my legs? The legs that had felt like heavy appendages up until only a week before? Something special was happening. I started wondering to myself: “If this is where I am on Day 8, where might I be on Day 180?” Hope had returned.
That hope was well placed. Although recovery, especially in the first two months, followed an up and down course, the overall trend was steadily upwards. After just three weeks of brain rewiring, I went on a much longer 45 minute walk up a considerable hill. I could not believe it! There was no one to share my joy with at the top of the hill, although there were some passing sheep, so I made a point of informing them of the significance of the moment. The constant pain in my feet and legs also disappeared after three weeks. Whereas before, I had found it painful for my feet even to touch the ground, one morning that pain just disappeared. The feeling that I was perpetually ‘coming down with the flu’ also went away at that time. I had a lot more energy. At the seven week mark, another extraordinary thing happened: my sensitivity to chemicals reduced dramatically. I went into the bathroom and noticed something, or rather I did not notice something. Whereas before I would have been ‘hit’ by a wave of chemical smells, suddenly I did not smell anything at all. I took the lids off all the bathroom products and started sniffing. Yes, some of them were still very pungent, but I had to take the lids off to smell them, whereas before that would have been unnecessary: I would have smelled them strongly just by being in the room.
It was after around three months of rewiring that, for all intents and purposes, most limbic system related impairment had cleared up. Apart from the occasional extra whiff of perfume (something which still happens today), my sense of smell was normal. There was no inappropriate release of adrenalin and my energy levels were fairly consistent. My digestion was back to normal. My standing heart rate scores were nearly always below 100 and were often in the 80s. My supine to standing heart rate would increase between 12 and 24 beats, and usually between 15-20 – all normal scores. I kept going though with my rewiring for the full six month period as I wanted to hardwire the changes in. I was taking no chances! I kept a quasi-monastic schedule in my brain rewiring: one hour at 8 AM and 45 minutes at both midday and 5 PM, and sometimes 20 minutes before bed. Looking back now, I’m humbled by the discipline I kept in doing this. Finally, I had found a good use for my type-A personality!
Fast forward one year and a half, and I remain without POTS. There have been two or three times over the last year when various difficult events led to a noticeable and fairly steady – if light - release of adrenalin, and occasionally to the return of the hypnagogic jerks. On those occasions, I returned to the DNRS exercises and both cleared up fairly quickly. Basically, the DNRS worked and the changes stuck. These days, I can be sure of having consistent energy for most of the day, unless I have been pushing myself too hard and as long as I have been maintaining a good diet. I like to go for long walks of around 12 kilometres fairly often, something which would have been inconceivable when I was unwell and a ten minute walk necessitated two hours ‘recovery time’ in bed.
Of course, life is life and it ain’t plain sailing. I still have quite a driven character, although this has lessened considerably in the last two years (and I’m really working on it! Its time is limited!). And I am still prone to anxiety, especially in social circumstances, something which I find frustrating. I also still have PTSD related symptoms, although these have softened significantly in some regards. Learning how to live well and healthily is an ongoing process. The DNRS does not turn you into a super human but rather into someone with a neurotypical limbic system (or ‘neurotypical enough’). I do have to live within limits, and if I exceed those, I know about it fairly quickly. That has always been the case however and most people have to live within limits – it’s only in the movies that people get away with a high-paced life. The main point is I have my life back, I don’t have POTS, and for that I will forever be grateful to Annie Hopper and the DNRS.
For me, I didn’t know my journey had begun until I was already in it. I thought I had a temporary bug. I thought I would wake up one day and it would be over. Little did I know, it was just the beginning. I was spiralling down and down and just when I thought I had hit rock bottom, things would get worse.
I have heard that you never know when your last good day is. At the time, it is just another good day. I was stuck in a rut of wondering if I would ever have that “good day” back again. Could I play another sport again? Would I be able to stand again with ease? Questions like these spiralled in my head as I replayed torturous events in my head over and over again.
I wasn’t even sure what was wrong with me. With such an array of symptoms, doctors didn’t know where to start with me. I received blanket diagnoses with no true cure and was passed from specialist to specialist. Everyone wanted to tell me it was “in my head” or that it would go away with time.
In my journey to find a diagnosis, I went to 25 different specialists in 2 different networks (not including blood tests, halter monitors, echocardiograms, EKGs, tilt tests, hearing tests, balance tests, CT scans, MRIs, and so many trips to the ER that I lost track). This all happened over a period of over 6 years! In January 2015, after much research, I brought the diagnosis of POTS to my doctor whom indeed confirmed this. However, determining the culprit did not mean I had found a cure.
By this point, I was 28 years old, married, and my husband and I had moved back in with my parents so that they could help care for me. Now that I had a diagnosis of POTS, I was sent to a new specialist, a neurologist. From there, we began experimenting to find the perfect recipe of medications that would help. I started various dosages of propranolol, midodrine, venlafaxine, and fludrocortisone. I was told to just “try and walk more”. We tried various techniques of raising the head of the bed to try and train my body to be upright again and prescription compression stockings. Nothing seemed to do the trick and some things even made my symptoms worse.
My life was rapidly getting narrower and narrower. I could barely stay standing for 15 seconds. I had to sit on the bathroom floor just to brush my teeth. I rarely had enough energy to get dressed in the morning let alone to leave my house. My doctor and I decided it was time that I got a wheelchair.
Adjusting to my new limitations was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, I felt I was doing the best with my circumstances and on the other it had felt like I had given up. I was a prisoner to my own body. I was using a shower chair, struggled to lift my hands above my head to wash my hair, and was using room temperature water followed by freezing water before I ended my shower due to incredible heat intolerance. Sometimes I didn’t leave my house for weeks at a time. When I did leave, it was for very minor short trips and I would need someone with me who could help with my wheelchair. I couldn’t lift anything - I couldn’t even hold my own purse. I remember one time being at the store, using the electric shopping cart and my body was so weak that I could barely push the button to move forward – I nearly passed out.
I was now also diagnosed with leaky gut and malnourishment. I could barely eat anything anymore. When I could eat, I was living off unseasoned chicken and white rice. I was reacting to almost every food. I tested allergic to tomatoes, tree nuts, cows milk, and 12 environmental allergies that I never had until adulthood. My doctor advised that I avoid artificial sugars, eggs, gluten, MSG, and GMO products on top of my other restrictions. My stool samples kept testing positive for malnourishment. I wasn’t holding any nutrients. I went from 126 lbs down to 101 lbs (nearly 20% of my body weight). My legs were basically skin and bone due to muscle loss from me not using them even to stand anymore. Every second of every day, I was living in misery.
I obviously could no longer hold a job. Being bedridden and homebound was spent laying around trying to think my way out of my illness, further strengthening the connections in my brain that had me stuck in this trauma loop. I couldn’t listen to music because the sounds would over-stimulate me and even change my heart rate. I couldn’t watch TV because the shows and commercials would cause the same reaction. At times, I could tolerate very slow content for short periods of time. However, the light sensitivity caused me to spend most of my days just sitting in the dark. Reading was nearly impossible as the words danced around the page and made me completely nauseous. I didn’t have energy to even carry a conversation on the phone. I even remember smiling being too much at times.
My husband and my mother were my in-home nurses. I couldn’t cook or even cut my own food. I was getting daily visual migraines. I couldn’t walk up a single step in the house or do even a minor incline. My fibromyalgia was causing severe chest and stomach pains throughout the day. I couldn’t drive. I couldn’t even sit in the passengers seat without having my legs up on the dashboard to prevent the blood from pooling in my legs. I constantly needed to be lying down. I had a lot of muscle shakes and tremors. The constant isolation overwhelmed me with anxiety and depression.
It seemed that every doctor I went to, we found more things wrong but none of the solutions were chipping away at the illness. I was diagnosed with POTS, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, sensitivity to light/noise, leaky gut, malnourishment, IBS, PTSD, asthma, food and environmental allergies, anaemia, hypoglycaemia, severe heat intolerance, my sinuses were completely blocked and inflamed, a cyst was found on my pituitary gland, I tested positive for Epstein Barr Virus, and my appendix even burst at the age of 26. It was easier for me to list what wasn’t wrong with me than what was. Even on beta-blockers, my resting heart rate was 60-80 BPM and upon standing up it would rise up as high as 215 BPM. I was now using multiple pill boxes to organize my 4 prescriptions and 14 supplements that were taken multiple times throughout the day. My next step was getting my reclining electric wheelchair.
The fear of my future and the fear of the unknown were overwhelming. I wasn’t ready to live the rest of my life like this. I felt like this was the end of the road. The day of my appointment to get fitted for my new wheelchair, I took a leap of faith. I decided to cancel the appointment and research all I could to find a better future for myself. That is when I came across Lauren Dinkel’s website “Wheelchair to Rollerblades.” I felt like I was reading my own story. I had never heard of anyone going through what I was let alone a recovery story. I was split with hope and skepticism.
Her story ended with a full recovery through the DNRS program. I sent a link of the program to my functional MD asking if she thought it was a good idea or if she thought it was a scam. It just seemed too good to be true to me. My doctor thought it was a great idea. I ordered the DVDs and I began the seminar December 14, 2015.
After the first day of the seminar, I already felt more energy. I felt like I was in control of my life again. I was learning to be a curious observer of my own habits so I would not fall into the same pathways that I did in the past. I only surrounded myself with positivity. I wouldn’t communicate the daily symptoms with anyone, not even myself. I wasn’t going to feed the limbic monster to put up a stronger fight against me. I kept a journal of my daily accomplishments and exercises. I continued to seek beauty in every aspect of my life and to continue looking at the future. The past was already written and there was no turning back.
I began working the program daily with incremental challenges that were in my training zone. I started off with the goal of standing and walking for 30 seconds and built up daily to 45 minutes. I also started with the challenge of climbing one step and built up to 2 flights up and down. I started doing exercises on the floor with 6 lbs and built up to 20 lbs. I reintroduced tomatoes (which I once tested allergic to) into my diet by starting with one grape tomato and building to a pasta dinner. I noticed things were getting better when I stopped noticing things anymore. I wasn’t thinking about how long I was standing or taking an inventory of my 24/7 symptoms because they weren’t there anymore.
Within 15 days of the program, I was no longer using my wheelchair. Within a few months, I threw out my shower chair. I was now leaving the house everyday. Cooking for myself and for my husband. Doing chores around the house I couldn’t do for years. Driving again. I was watching TV Shows and movies again. Not only was I listening to music again but I was singing along and dancing to it! My life had completely transformed. I felt like I was me again.
By July, I no longer had leaky gut or malnourishment. By the end of the year, I gained nearly 20 lbs back. Things were clearing up that I didn’t even know were possible. Arthritis from my broken finger had gone away, my sinuses were no longer clogged and inflamed, my chest and stomach pains disappeared, my migraines vanished, and I was in a better mood all of the time.
Even my dreams transformed! I was no longer dreaming I was disabled or restricted. My anxiety and depression improved greatly. I was no longer experiencing PTSD. I was affectively rewiring my own brain!
After analyzing my journey, my doctor and I came to the conclusion that the perfect storm that triggered the illness for me was salmonella poisoning December 23, 2008 that left me hospitalized. Before that trigger, I was completely healthy and very active. I graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in physical education and a minor in health. I loved working out and playing sports.
Although I have made such huge strides in recovery, my story is not over yet. I still meet POTS criteria but I know if I can make it this far then I can make it all of the way. Not only have I made these improvements but a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders and my loved ones’ shoulders. I am no longer sick with stress of the unknown. I am no longer going to multiple specialists a week and coming home without answers.
Struggling in life is inevitable but defeat is a choice. The DNRS program takes a lot of dedication and hard work but it is completely worth it to reclaim your life. Rise up to the challenge and take back control of your life.

  That's when they found an oil soaked rag had been thrown on the roof to start the fire. After midnight, when the men that had helped fight the fire started home, they found that the bridge was on fire but was too far gone already to save it. There had been some tracks allegedly left by the arsonists but because of the pairs attitude at the fire attention was focused on them. Because the Parke County Sheriff wasn't available one of the counties deputies started an investigation. He deputized another man and had Blake Gloss drive them from Rockville to

 The heart has a sac around it called the pericardium. The purpose of this sac is to protect the heart from the structures that surround it. Inside the sac there is normally a small amount of fluid evenly spread in a thin layer around the whole heart. This fluid around the heart is known as pericardial fluid and basically acts as a lubricant to allow the heart to pump and turn with minimal friction. I’ll use the terms fluid around the heart and pericardial effusion interchangeably throughout this article so you become familiar with the terms.
How does Excess Fluid Around the Heart Develop?
There is normally a small amount of fluid around the heart (small pericardial effusion). This is produced by the sac around the heart and is an important part of normal heart functioning. Excess fluid around the heart is known as a pericardial effusion. But where does this excess fluid come from? Often, when the heart experiences inflammation (known as pericarditis) extra fluid releases and collects within the sac. It is also possible for blood to fill the sac during or after trauma, surgery, or complications of other heart procedures. Blood around the heart is known as hemopericardium. The fluid around the heart is usually continually produced and drained, so the level stays constant. Sometimes in patients with heart failure, high pressures within the heart cause the fluid not to drain properly. The body, however, continues to produce pericardial fluid, leading to excess fluid around the heart (chylous pericardial effusion).
The most common cause of pericardial effusion is inflammation of the lining around the heart. In most cases, the exact caused is never found. In other cases an autoimmune reaction – where the body attacks its own cells – is the culprit. This is primarily seen in conditions like lupus and rheumatoid. Some drugs have also been associated with the development of pericardial effusion . Another caused of excess fluid around the heart is kidney disease (uremic pericardial effusion). Finally, it is relatively common to see small amounts of excess pericardial fluid during pregnancy.
A bloody pericardial effusion is typically a more urgent issue and is seen as a result of blood leaking from inside the heart, or from the large vessels that leave the heart. Causes may include heart muscle tearing during a heart attack or a tearing of the great vessels leaving the heart (an aortic dissection). More rarely, a bloody pericardial effusion can result from the presence of cancer cells in the lining around the heart. In these cases, cancer typically originates elsewhere in the body and invades the heart.
Imagine the sac around the heart (pericardium) to be like a hot water bottle that’s the shape of a heart that allows for a small amount of fluid to be there acting like a lubricant. If there’s a sudden, significant increase in fluid around the heart, the sac doesn’t expand. Instead, the fluid compresses the heart, as the pressure inside the sac are greater than the pressure inside the heart. This renders the heart incapable of filling with blood, essentially causing a shortage of oxygenated blood. This process is known as cardiac tamponade and can be life threatening.
Cardiac tamponade only occurs if there is a sudden and significant increase in pericardial fluid or if there is a very large amount of fluid collected over time. Interestingly, it can be more dangerous for just 50cc of fluid to collect rapidly, than for 1 liter of fluid to collect over time. Why is this? When there is a slower accumulation of pericardial fluid over time, the sac around the heart slowly enlarges to accommodate the fluid – something it cannot do if there is a sudden increase. Effusions involving blood are often emergencies, because the blood may leak into the sac at high pressure.
When I drain these effusions, sometimes patients are surprised that such a small amount of fluid could cause such a big problem. Other patients are amazed such a large amount of fluid (often liters) wasn’t causing noticeable problems.
The main way to assess a pericardial effusion is an ultrasound scan of the heart known as an echocardiogram. The echo helps quantify the amount of fluid around the heart, tells us how the heart is handling the excess fluid, and determines what action must be taken. Sometimes features on the echocardiogram help us determine the fluid type, i.e. blood vs. other. Pericardial effusions are also commonly picked up on CT scans. CT scans are useful for determining the amount of fluid around the heart; however, echocardiograms are more effective for understanding how the pericardial effusion is affecting the heart.
The treatment for pericardial effusion depends upon the amount of fluid surrounding the heart. Generally, patients with pericardial effusion are broken into three groups; mild, moderate, or large (cardiac tamponade).
Unless it has occurred rapidly and led to unstable symptoms, mild pericardial effusion is usually found by chance on scans performed for other purposes. Typically a mild effusion will require no specific treatment for the effusion itself. Instead, the underlying cause is treated. The presence of an effusion may alert the physician to perform various tests to identify a cause and rule out more serious causes. For example, if the effusion is attributed to lupus, the effusion will probably resolve with treatment of lupus. The same may apply to any cause. Typically a follow-up scan is performed to ensure the effusion has resolved. Sometimes the fluid is drained and sent for analysis.
The management of a moderate pericardial effusion depends on the individual case, its effect on heart function, and the presence of symptoms. In some cases, especially when the underlying cause is known and there is no significant effect on the heart function, the effusion may just be monitored over time with echocardiograms. If the effusion persists, grows larger over time, or causes symptoms it may need to be drained. The cardiologist in charge of the case will typically make this decision.
Large effusions will typically be drained. After the excess fluid around the heart has been drained, a drain may be temporarily left in place to ensure further fluid does not accumulate. In some cases, particularly when effusions recur, a hole is made in the sac to allow continuous drainage.
Effusions themselves don’t cause chest pain; however, effusions associated with pericarditis – inflammation of the sac around the heart – may be associated with chest pain.
When do we drain the fluid around the heart?
In general there are two indications to drain pericardial effusions. First, doctors remove the fluid if it is affecting heart function. Second, doctors will drain fluid around the heart to test the pericardial fluid in a lab and determine the effusions’s cause.
How do we drain fluid around the heart?
There are 2 main ways to do drain pericardial fluid. The first is a minimally invasive procedure – known as a pericardiocentesis – that involves passing a small tube through the skin into the lining around the heart. The fluid is drained through the tube, and a drain can be left in if required. The second is a surgical procedure that involves making a small incision underneath the breastbone. As in a pericardiocentesis, a tube is used to access the pericardial fluid, often making a small hole in the lining of the pericardial sac known as a pericardial window. The window will generally stay open over time, allowing constant drainage of the fluid to prevent accumulation.
The less invasive pericardiocentesis procedure is usually tried first. Often the drain is left for up to a few days to see if the fluid builds back up. If the fluid continues to accumulate, a pericardial window procedure can be considered. Sometimes an immediate surgical approach is required, particularly in emergencies when a bloody effusion is caused by a rupture of the heart or the great vessels itself.
How big is the effusion and is it affecting the function of the heart?
What is the cause of the effusion?
If the effusion is felt large or significant enough to be drained, what is the way in which this will be done, and what is the plan if it should come back?
Finally, what is the long-term treatment plan?
What Does An Echocardiogram Show?
Its interesting but we often aren’t able to identify a single cause. The pain is die to inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, a condition known as pericarditis. In terms of follow up, surveillance to ensure no new development of symptoms such as dizziness, and ensuring the size of the effusion is stable over time is important.
2 causes that spring to mind are sternal wire related pain and pericarditis which is inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart, if the pain is significantly affecting you it can be addressed. I suggest seeing the surgeon that performed the operation and discussing.
Hi” Doctor It’s me again Jasmine I been to three hospitals since the last time I spoke to you and they’re telling me that I may have nerve damage I’m still having pain it feel like someone is punching me in my ribs I wanted to go to Deborah heart hospital what should I do please help me.
My husband had a pericardial effusion in April. While draining it off, the very agitated doctor punctured his heart and he started bleeding profusely. They had to crack open his sternum and stitch up the heart but he was in terrible pain for 6 weeks.
Is this a common error?
It is not common, however it is a known risk.
Hi Doctor, I’m 30 weeks pregnant and my doctor just told me that my baby has fluid around his heart. What can happen because of that?
Depends on the amount of fluid, its effect on heart function and why it occurred.
That’s wonderful to hear & a Blessing for such a young person. As a senior I’m about to see my cardiologist for fluid around my heart I wasn’t even aware of. After having a CT scan for something else it was discovered. I hope I have the same success. Good luck to your son.
I had the same problem and spent a fortune with the cardiologist who then sent me to a pulmonologist who discovered that I had an allergy . I was allergic to tea!
just left emergency yesterday told small amount of fluid around heart , I have factor 5 and they injected the dye and was cleared of clot and told this , and to follow up with a cardiologist.
Yes it took a couple trips to the emergency room.
Hasn’t anybody heard about nutrition?A good diet is very important. We know vitamin E complex full spectrum E is good for many things including more oxygen,fighting free radicals, and the heart muscle,etc.There are good multimineral liquids.Vital.A good multi food form – food state- food bonded, are some of the terms used for true all natural vitamins.

Surgeon attempted to add a third lead in prep for a new 3 lead icd. In doing so, he put a hole through the heart muscle into the pericardium. What is the treatment for this?
A lot depends on the way it heals. If there is no damage and no persistent effusion it may be left alone, if there is persistent complication it may need to be removed.
I just had CABG X4, on Feb 29th, 2016. I was discharged 7 days out and re-admitted on March 9th. 3 days later, the Surgeon drained 1400 mililiters of fluid and 4 days later on March 16th, 1250 milliliters were drained. I was discharged on March 17th. I feel as though I have fluid building back up. How likely is this?
If you had surgery then collection of fluid would be odd as your pericardium has been opened and so should essentially drain on its own preventing fluid building. Sometimes leakage of blood can occur in pockets leading to a localized collection of fluid. Are you sure you aren’t referring to fluid in the lungs? Build up of that can be more common after surgery.
How are they going to drain the fluid?
My son-in-law had a large amount of bloody fluid removed from the heart sac last Sat – so much fluid that the right ventricle was collapsing. Cause unknown as of yet; what is most likely cause?
I have been diagnosed with pericardial effusion. They believe the cause is because of my hypothyroidism. However, the last couple of days I have been in alot of pain in my chest area. They said it was the inflammation. Which they said would happen. How much pain is to much pain and when should I go back to the hospital?
Its not really safe to answer this without seeing you and i would recommend you call the dr looking after the case. With the chest pain you are having i suspect that pericarditis is the cause which is the inflammation. In terms of the effusion itself, symptoms of concern would be dizziness, passing out, low blood pressure, light headedness etc. Its also usual to have 2 scans in a close time period to ensure no significant enlargement or change. If you are worried, speak to a medical provider rather than take a chance.
If there is a pericardial effusion that is large enough that it needs draining then a surgically placed pericardial window is generally a relatively low risk procedure and the effusion wont recur. It depends why the effusion is there and that needs working up fully.
If pericardiodentitis done….have chance to come again…..
My friend’s 25 year old son had an aortic valve REPAIR (not replacement) for congenital aortic bicuspid valve and aneurysm. 10 days post op and now they drained 1000 cc of old blood from the pericardium and have drain to monitor. They said this complication had a low probability of occurence 🙁 They said the echo showed it is not a leak. How can blood accumulate without a leak? Could it be an inflammatory response ? Thanks!
Its difficult to know without knowing the specifics. Effusions can occur for a number of reasons however less likely after heart surgery as the sac around the heart is already open. It depends on the type of blood that came out. If the bleeding doesn’t stop and the drain output remains high he may need to go back for a re-exploration to ensure no residual sourced.
My son had valve replacement 7/13/16 and was found to have a pericardial effusion on 7/25…had 300cc drained on 7/27 and the drain was able to be removed in almost 24 hours. How long after removal of the tube should he feel more comfortable and feel like he can breathe easier? He feels like with in a few days after the open heart surgery he was better than after this procedure.
It depends on the cause of the pain, if it is pericardial pain from inflammation it may take a few days to settle down with appropriate treatment. If he is in pain, and it is felt to be related to possible pericarditis, he may need to be on good doses of anti-inflammatory medicines to improve things.
I have been admitted for pericardial effusion and drained it. All the lab checks did not prove anything wrong with my body including TB virus. But the the doctor told me to begin AKT along with steroids for one month. He said virus is one of the reason for this so its better to have it. Five days back only I have seen this site and realised very informative. If I would have seen your site earlier then I would have not started the AKT. Now he said I have to continue it for nine months. Is it necessary?

My father (aged 66, end stage kidney failure) diagnosed with pericardial effusion (ranging 1.2-1.5cm by echo) due to pericarditis and sepsis. The Dr said pericardiocentesis is not needed at this moment. The fluid would eventually goes off through regular dialysis. May I know is this true? My father has no other symptoms except general weakness.
I would ask them what the indication for drainage is, is there an effect on the heart function?
My 17 year old daugher who used to be active and cheerleader and healthy looking now looks tired and sick and sleeps a lot and she is pale and skinny and fragile. She caught mono last year and has never been the same. They have since done about 4 ultrasounds of her heart and they all show fluid around her heart. We’ve had couple of trips to the ER due to the amount of pain on the left side of her chest. Her knees hurt to move them and she gets dizzy sometimes when standing. She also gets migraines and when they told her to take motrin to help with the fluid around her heart it triggered her to have a migraine. They also have her a prescriprion style and it did the same. Please help her I feel like we’re going in circles and not getting anywhere but the same test over and over but nothing to help her.
Hi Leslie, in this case the fluid around the heart appears to be the result of a systemic process that is causing these symptoms. The fluid is almost certainly not the cause. She needs an extensive work up for systemic illnesses. I suggest seeing a specialist infectious diseases or a well known internal medicine specialist.
Can fluid around the heart cause it to stop resulting in death if left untreated?
Yes but only if the fluid impairs the ability of the heart to function. In some cases i have taken over a liter out and although it was a lot, the heart was handling it fine as it had likely had a long time to accommodate, in some cases i have had to take a little as 100ml out emergently since its rapid accumulation led to compromised heart function. It differs in every case. Th echocardiogram and in some cases right heart catheterization are very useful in determining significance. Not every effusion needs draining, many can be surveyed over time.
I just picked up the death certificate and the cause of death was asystolic cardiac arrest. I was thinking it was pericardial effusion due to his symptoms and the fluid that the doctor mentioned. I’m not sure what asystolic cardiac arrest is but will research it. Thank you for your time and help!
Yes, small or moderate effusions are often not considered clinically significant and don’t need draining necessarily. Serial echocardiography is performed to ensure they remain stable over time and don’t grow or change in character.
My friend has told me he has fluid on his heart but will not tell me anymore information about what the doctors have said and is bottling it up. After doing research I can see this could be quite serious. He has a follow up appointment in 4 months. But I feel there is something he should be doing whilst waiting for the appointing I.e. Resting, not drinking, not smoking and on medication please could you advise?
It depends on the cause of the effusion. Can you check whether it is fluid on the heart or fluid on the lungs?
What if it is fluid on the heart which a family member has just been diagnosed with. The fluid was bloody. Am a little confused. Should we be determine the cause of the extra fluid and why it was bloody or both? Can you share causes of bloody fluid even after lab results were all negative (not sure what actual lab results they did). Which also leads me to asking what lab tests should’ve been done. Thanks very much.
A lot of potential causes really but if the extra fluid was bloody and all lab results negative then its likely a small blood vessel was causing the blood in the effusion from the tap. Lab tests include cultures, gram stain, cytology, ldh, viral assays, protein, etc.. they are pretty standard and sent in most cases so i wouldn’t worry.
A stress echocardiogram was done 10/16/06 for nocturnal tachypalpitations. At that time no pericardial effusion was mentioned. And it was recommended I continue with prophylactic antibiotics for mitral valve regurgitation. 10/27/16, I was asked to wear a holter monitor and the result from that was normal. In 8/09 and 9/09, a small amount of pericardial fluid, indeterminate, was noted on abdominal ultrasounds. I saw the same cardiologist again in 10/09, for fatigue, and dyspnea. A small, localized, hemodynamically insignificant posterior pericardial effusion was noted on the echocardiogram this time. January 21, 2010, I had another abdominal ultrasound and again a small pericardial effusion of indeterminate significance is noted. Since then, every abdominal ultrasound I’ve had, continues to show this pericardial effusion.
This is a very sad story of how people can be missed diagnosed and I was. My current PCP doesn’t think this is an issue but my Integrative Medicine MD does! I am upset that no one really looks into why this is a continual finding except the Integrative Medicine MD. There’s a reason this is happening. I had a bacterial overgrowth, SIBO, that was misdiagnosed that lead to permanent damage to my gut lining. I have a fungal overgrowth in my tissues that I know started in my gut due to overprescribing of antibiotics growing up plus never being breast fed. I have had benign tumors on my thyroid, elevated ANA’s (false positives for lupus, etc.) my gall bladder died inside and the PCP never referred me to a GI doctor until 3 years after my symptoms began, I have/had chronic indigestion, my liver enzymes are chronically elevated, chronic leaky gut, the is list goes on. I believe the issue is from chronic digestive infections in the gut because I am not able to balance my gut flora anymore, plus this problem is contributing to the leaky gut and autoimmune disease. I can’t have gluten or any food that’s inflammatory to my gut. The bone pains occur especially after taking an antibiotic. I remember before 2006 taking NSAID’s, motrin, advil regularly and I know too this was irritating the gut.
I just wanted to know why my PCP doesn’t refer me to a cardiologist when I asked him about this chronic problem….wouldn’t the cardiologist get to the bottom of the small pericardial effusion?
I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you.
I recommend a rheumatologist input also. The small effusion itself is a manifestation of the systemic disease and not a primarily heart issue. Serial echocardiography repeated at determined intervals can ensure its stability. Otherwise the input from a cardiologist would be minimal at this point assuming the rest of the cardiac function is ok.
Hi, what should be the frequency/intervals of echocardiography incase of pericardial effusion?
It depends on the size of the effusion and the clinical history.
Since 9/2009, there’s continual mention of a small pericardial effusion on my abdominal ultrasounds. I have been ill since then. Why doesn’t the PCP investigate this? I have had 2 echoes and both show this pericardial effusion. I have elevated ANA’s, digestive infections, SIBO, chronic fungal infection due to getting a candida overgrowth from taking numerous antibiotics and never being told to take probiotics going back to 1990. I am concerned that western medicine doesn’t acknowledge or understand the why this is happening. Whereas my Integrative Medicine md is very concerned as to the cause. My PCP just laughed at me…they don’t look at the cause and don’t even ask what my prior history is prior to me coming to them. Its been a long road since 2009, health wise for me…real eye opening road. I have a damaged gut lining from a misdiagnosed and untreated bacterial overgrowth..very sad…that didn’t help with me getting a fungal overgrowth which started in the gut (hyphal fungus) and is now in my tissues throughout my body. So so sad. I just wanted to know if I should see a cardiologist again to see if he could determine the cause. I would appreciate any feedback.
My mom is recently diagnosed with mild pericardial effusion. She was given Lasix for 2 days and medicines for 10 days. Now it is 3rd day. From the day 1 after the treatment she feels completely alright. But swelling of legs havent reduced completely. Is this curable. Cardiologist requested to check in the hospital anytime if she vomits r has chest pain. Is it related to heart failure. She is just 47. Much worried.
My brother was hospitalized for pericardial effusion. They drained the fluid last week due to tremendous pain. Four days after leaving the hospital he was in extreme pain and was taken back to the hospital where he was diagnosed with more fluid. He is currently in the hospital on pain medication. I am worried and wonder if this pain will ever subside?
The pain you have is pericarditis, this can be treated and should be bought to the attention of the treating team. It depends on the underlying condition that caused the effusion, if it has been treated then the effusion may well not recur.
I was diagnosed with the pericardial effusion when I was 5 years old. It was a serious surgery done by the cardiologist and now I’m 25 years old. But sometimes I feel acute pressure and mild pain in my heart. Doctor please tell me that whether it will reoccur or not ? And what are the causes behind it’s reoccurrence ?
My husband is on dialysis for last 8 1/2 years, he has a fistular on left hand, he had fluid drained last June, don’t know how much, was in a lot of pain on the right side of the heart after surgery until end of August, all tests didn’t show anything. After surgery heparin was on hold during dialysis, flushes of saline was used instead. This past week he was put back on Heparin. He is also blind in left eye, for the last 14 1/2 years, small % on right eye, he thinks he is being attacked by bugs on dialysis chain, he feels they sting him.
Two concerns please, is Heparin the caused of fluid build up at the “back” of heart?
Can you suggest anything about dialysis patients or his side effect of being stung.
What was the nature of the fluid that was drained from the heart?
hi doctor one of my small cousin 6 years of age have pericardial effusion. if preventials are necessary mean what to eat & what to avoid?
Very useful information gained from this article. I request you to please clarify further that how much amount of fluid accumulated for mild, moderate and large.
There are many factors that determine this, not simply the size alone. Its not the amount of fluid, rather its physiologic significance that is important.
I had a pericardial effusion 7 months ago and it was treated with colchisine and prednisone. the fluid has completely gone. Sometimes i feel a slight pain iny chest and shortness of breath but it usually goes away. When should i worry and go to the ER, what are the chances that it can come back?
In general, an echocardiogram should be repeated after some time to ensure no fluid build up. The pain may be pericarditis, however i would recommend you seek a medical opinion at least initially to rule out other possible causes.
Salams to you 🙂 I was diagnosed with Pericarditis in August of 2016 and they drained 50cc’s using a needle and catheter. I stayed on Colchicine and Ibuprofen 600 for 3 months post procedure.
Since I stopped taking Colchicine I have not been feeling well at all. My entire left side always feels inflammed and wired 🙁 I went to the emergency room maybe 3 times since and they confirm everytime that there is nothing wrong and no fluid is building up. Can this be a permanent condition from piir recovery?? Or does it sound like muscle breakdown?
It sounds like ongoing pericarditis, have you had a repeat echocardiogram and EKG? I would seek an opinion regarding treatment of likely ongoing pericarditis.
My 12 month old daughter just received an echocardiogram for a heart murmur, the issue was found to be a small hole that will heal as she grows. However, they found a small amount of fluid around her heart, but said it was likely nothing, and they were not worried. Can you put my mind at ease a little more, and explain if this can be truly be somewhat normal? And what to watch for to see if it’s becoming worse? Thank you!!
Ask – what is the likely cause of the fluid? how much fluid is there? is the fluid of significance in heart function? how often will the fluid need to be surveyed by imaging?
I have a pericardial effusion, diagnosed 8 months ago after having an echocardiogram a few weeks after I was seen in the ER for abdominal pain. I had a uti at the time. I hadn’t had chest pain except for occasional twinges on the left side at that time.
A week ago I had a repeat echo & was told I still have fluid around my heart but not as much as 8 months ago.
I’ve had no more pain until the last few days. I have substernal & rib pain over my left side every night. I’m in pain after i get up in the morning but after taking an ibuprofen I feel better during the day. I have an appt. with my doctor next week.
Should I be concerned I’m having pain every night & that this hasn’t resolved in over 8 months? I do feel fine during the day, I’ve had no tachycardia or hypertension.
Could my pain indicate I have pericarditis as well as pericardial effusion?
Thanks for any assistance. Your article was very helpful.
Recurrent pericarditis is a possiblity, an EKG may help also, in some cases if other causes are ruled out the pericarditis is treated to see if there is a response.
Following a large a precardial effusion I undergo two weeks ago , I am still feeling totally unwell and some days several chest pain , short of breath and total exhaustion, I am aware that some of the fluid around the heart is not fully drained and told the body will get rid of it, I am still concerned what could I do to treat this problem as I am due to see my consultant in two weeks .
What was the cause of the effusion, were you given any medical treatment? how was the effusion drained?
A great article – easy to read and understand. Has helped open up my mind further as I am waiting for the removal of the fluid next week. At lease now I have an idea on what to seek to know from the doctor.
Glad you found it useful.
My wife’s diagnostic (6/7/17) is idiopathic chylous pericardial effusion with tamponade.
We went for her preop exams for her back surgery (L5) and that’s how the effusion was detected. She had no symptoms.
She underwent thoracoscopic and mini thoracotomy approach to create a large anterior left pericardial window draining into the left pleural space. We are going Tuesday for another procedure to eliminate the fluid that keeps accumulating in her pleural space. Dr estimate over 1L in three weeks since the window procedure.
Her heartbeat doesn’t go below 93bpm. When she was accepted in the hospital her bpm was 150.
The chyle was peachy in color and all the lab work came in negative.
Drs. are still puzzled over the cause. What should we do? Where is the best place in the US for a second opinion? Please help us. I’m really concerned.
The approach to treatment of chylopericardium is through a chyle diet and pericardiocentesis, which is effective in over half of patients. If conservative treatment fails, surgical intervention and octreotide injections should be considered. In this case the surgical option has been done also which has the advantage of preventing tamponade. In some cases of strong recurrence anomaly of the lymphatic system may be sought and tests such as MRI and lymphangiograms performed to see if further treatment options are available. Im not sure of the ‘best place in the US’ for this but i would recommend a facility with strong collaboration between thoracic surgery, cardiac surgery and cardiology.
What was the cause. At some point you should have a repeat scan to ensure the stability of the effusion.
I am a 33 years old female . At the age of 26, I started to suffer missed beats and shortness of breath. I was diagnosed then to have a mild prolapsed mitral valve. I get the symptoms only at times of great stress, pressure or insomnia. Only last month I started to feel shortness of breath during exercise , an unusual exhaustion and fatigue in addition to increased irregular palpitations any time during the day… I thought it might have to do with my chronic nasal sinus problem that started 2002. I thought it is anemia, but I checked and it wasn’t low, and still I take iron supplement.
Yesterday, the echocardiogram showed I have a trival MVP and a 6mm posterior pericardial effusion. Is that something I should worry about? I want to resume my normal routine, get rid of this fatigue and resume morning workout.. I am not an athlete.. Only a regular woman excising for an hour on average thee – four days a week.
You have a small effusion which is not likely problematic in itself. You should likely have a repeat echocardiogram at some point to ensure the stability of the effusion. The mvp is not a cause for concern.
When I was 18 I was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse. Since then I regularly have echo cardiograms done to check on it. This past March at 49 years old I had my echo and was told I have a small pericardial effusion. They said not to worry come back in three months to have another echo. A year before this I noticed it was getting harder to exercise. I figured it was my age. I went back in July for a stress/echo test. The pericardial effusion stayed the same but my heart rate was very high for just walking on the treadmill. I explained to the doctor that I have always been very active, worked out 7 days a week since I was 21, rarely missed a day and pushed myself hard.I told him I’ve significantly had to slow down which is not normal for me. He brushed it off and told me I’m fine and that was it. During this time I had started with a cough, feeling like I always have phlegm in my throat. I figured it’s just allergies.(even though I’ve never had allergies) I mentioned it to my doctor but was told everyone has to clear their throat. The feeling in my throat has gotten worse, my voice is raspy all the time. I tried again asking my doctor and was told if it persists to call back. I then called another PCP and got in yesterday. He said he thinks this could be due to the pericardial effusion. He was shocked to learn that they were not looking for the cause of it. He put me on an antibiotic and sent me for blood work and a chest x-ray. My question is: Is it normal to be put on an antibiotic for this? I don’t know who to believe anymore. I just want to go back to normal. I don’t exercise at all anymore, I have no energy and just want to sleep all the time. Please help me. Let me know if this is the right treatment.
The pericardial effusion itself is not causing the symptoms of sore throat etc. It is possible that whatever is causing the effusion can be causing those symptoms if it is felt to be some form of systemic process affecting the body as a whole. Alternatively it could be entirely unrelated. In general a pericardial effusion is not treated with antibiotics, rather i suspect that was started for the sore throat. It reasonable for a systemic work up to be performed to rule out any systemic underlying cause of effusion.
While climbing I have breathing problems as well as doing hard work. Eco taken and found pericardial effusion .76 cm. What is the remedies and precaution. Please let me know. Anxiously waiting.
That is less than 2 cm, it is moderate in size, The question is how fast did it occur and is it causing symptoms. There are several echo features that can point towards the significance of an effusion and the need for action. Many effusions can be watched and may resolve with monitoring or treatment of the underlying cause. If there is no urgency felt in terms of the effusion its important to investigate for underlying causes of the effusion that may well be the cause of any symptoms present.
I had a routine trans thoracic evhocardiographic study yesterday due to chronic af. Have them done once a year. This time it showed a small generalized pericardial effusion. My cardiologist of 40 years was not concerned. I have no symptoms. I am very concerned. Would an echo show normal fluid. I will see him routinely in 3 months. Thank you.
A small effusion is not a dangerous finding however the cause of the effusion should be somewhat investigated before it is considered totally a benign finding. also it should be monitored at chosen intervals to ensure its stability.
Hi Doctor Mustafa. I went for a heart scan and the cardiologist said I have a 3cm pericardial effusion.. My leg is swollen and have sharp chest pains.. What do you advice me to do.
3cm or mm? if 3 cm, that is a large effusion, what was the cause given? such a large effusion may need consideration of drainage.
Hi Dr. AhmedMy name is Rose last April I wad told I had fluid around my heart. In August of this year the fluid is back around my heart. I was place back on Colchicine. My question is what calls pericardial to come back.
It really depends on the underlying cause, if there is a primary systemic process that leads to the effusion (such as thyroid, renal, lupus etc..) then if that flares up it is possible for the effusion to flare up again.
Thanks for the info. My 65yo mom has been hospitalized since 10/02, first for valve replacement, and continuing for numerous issues. She’s arrested twice, has 2 femoral paths, pik line, 15 bags hanging, tubes everywhere, etc. Today, 24 hours after they lessened sedation, breathing tube still in along with feeding tube, they rush her into the OR because of blood pooling around her heart. They are trying to get her heartbeat under control with meds, doctors said if it doesn’t work, she’ll go back under the knife. Their last words were that her heart is not doing good and that there’s not much more they can do.
Your explanation cleared up a lot of my questions. Thank you.
In August i had a CT Scan for an issue in my abdomen. I have since had surgery to correct this issue, which has left me with nerve damage. My surgeon referred me to pain management for nerve blocks. It was never mentioned to me, but this doctor told me the initial CT Scan showed a pericardial effusion. He has also referred me back to the surgeon for surgical management of a very large amount of fluid in my belly. I haven’t gained any weight but my pant size went up 2 sizes. I thought my stomach was just disfigured from the surgery.
This pericardial effusion was never mentioned to me by any of the doctors i saw until now. I have regular echos and will have another one in a couple months because I have severe aortic stenosis. From your article, I believe it may be heart failure or lupus related.
I assume since it was never mentioned to me it’s not a big concern. I have not seen my cardiologist since this. My echos have never shown this before. I tolerated the first surgery well. They may not be concerned, but I am a little. Is this just expected findings in some one with a sick heart?
4 weeks ago I had a cardiac ablation due to A-Fib. The cardio physiologist that performed the procedure micro perforated my heart, which led to pericarditis. After Echo it was determined that the fluid built up and I was given a Pericardiocentesis, felt ok for 2 weeks and now I’m feeling chest pain again .Can the Pericarditis return and what would the treatment be?
Its possible it can return, it depends on the underlying cause. If it returns, an EKG and echo are needed, the treatment will likely include an NSAID (such as indomethacin) and colchcine for a more extended period.
Hope he’s doing well! Effusions can happen after surgery and it seems like he has had the appropriate treatment.
Thanks for the great explanation, my mom is diagnosed with mild pericardial effusion and I was very worried. I would be great if you can help with precautions and diet that can heal it better. Actually Doctor prescribed 5-6 medicines to her for 6 months and she is feeling weak with those medicines. I am really very worried if those medicines are good for her. Please share your email ID if possible, I would like to consult with you. I will share her reports and prescription with you.
Diet does not necessarily play a role here.The important thing is to investigate the underlying cause of the effusion and treat that. The effusion should be monitored over time for size.
I have recently had a CT Scan. On it they said I have a pericardial effusion up to 13 CC. Would you consider that a mild, moderate or large effusion? Could you also tell me your scale of each?
That description alone isn’t helpful, 13cc doesn’t make sense, do they mean 1.3cm? An echocardiogram would be the next logical step.
I recently had anti-coagulation therapy for antiphospholipid syndrome with warfarin & heparin.
Due to a bad reaction to both of these medications I was admitted into hospital.
My chest cavity had swollen with the fluid so I was given half of a duretic an xray and a dopler scan kept in hospital for five days before being discharged.
On my discharge I was prescribed heparin injection but I had a similar reaction as with the warfarin. I became extremely swollen and had severe chest pain and a heaviness in my chest.
The pain affected my right shoulder and I could barely lift my head due to the pain in my neck.
Since these episodes I have a feeling as if a tennis ball is lodged high up between my breast bone, pain in my chest and back. I am once again feeling disorientated, off balance and my hands and fingers at times do not seem to function.
I have battled with my consultant to refer me urgently to cardiology which he has now done .
There is a ten week wait to be seen ! I am obviously very worried that what I am referring to is pericarditis. I have various autoimmune diseases, lupus, sjogrens, hypothyroid and hypoparathyroidism so feel I have good reason to be worried.
Hello I am 30 years old I was recently told by an er doctor that I have moderate pericardial effusion my question is if they have to drain it are you awake or asleep? I do have heart palpitations almost everyday I’m a little concerned about this diagnosis to be honest and I’m being seen by the va so I’m not at all comfortable with them any helpful advice is appreciated thank you!
Not all effusions need draining, in general only relatively large ones. With regards to drainage it depends on the method used. If needle pericardiocentesis is used then likely some sedation will be used, if a surgical window performed then general anaesthesia will be used.
The symptoms sound generalized and its not really possible to pin down the cause with this information. Its possible some of the tight chested feeling could be related to inflammation around the heart and its possible that is treated. I would make an appointment to get these issues checked out.
My mother in law 52 years had Pericardial Effusion and drained all bloody water from heart. Tested this blood but all negative and normal results came. Still 200ml remains in the heart as its very thick. What will be the next step and Is there any life risk ? Can this be drained/removed with medicine? Do we have to drain water often. What is permanent treatment?
Next step is surveillance echocardiography to ensure o more build up of fluid, and to evaluate to see the underlying cause of the effusion so that can be treated appropriately.
I had the pericardial sac removal from around my heart on the 6/3/18 I’m still getting breathless when I go walking,please advise Thanks.
You need the result of the surgery and your symptoms evaluated by a specialist. I recommend getting this looked in to.
In this setting, its not really possible to give info without knowing the situation, tests, and other info. Lets see what the cardiologist says.
What drugs are possibly known or thought to cause pericardial effusion? Zonisamide one of them?
Physiologic pericardial effusion typically means that it is normal and tiny. That would not explain shortness of breath.
Concerned about my other half… He was diagnosed with Pericardial Effusion June 3rd. Underwent Percardial window surgery the next day, draining over 1 Liter of fluid. It is now September and his left breast is still quite swollen and extremely tender. (Incision site just below left breast & drain hole below incision. Both well healed.) Everytime I go to hug him, he grabs my arm to protect it and keep me from bumping his breast. Any idea why this is still infammed and so sore? Please tell me this isn’t normal. What do you suggest?
I would start by seeing the treating surgeon and checking the wound etc. That isn’t normal although not necessarily anything immediately concerning.
good morning doctor. i had rectal cancer surgery about 3 years ago. have a permanent colostomy. aprox 6 months ago began experiencing several bowel obstructions. subsequently found some return of cancer. another surgery for a bypass recently had caused the obstructions to cease. i am starting chemo again in 2 weeks. recently had severe swelling in legs, ankle , scrotum and lower body. echo and e k g done. large amount of fluid drained( 1400 ml) subsequent echo shows no return of fluid.. test of fluid was negative. still have left leg pain and skin rash. pain in leg is sometimes intense. doctor is going to do doppler. am on water pill currently. please share your thoughts. thank you!
My mom 52yrs old was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and mild precardial effusion.is this prolapse can cause effusion or it can be due to other causes ?
I’m a 60 y/o African American female who was diagnosed with CHF 6 years ago. I had an ICD procedure to monitor my heart. EF was about 18% when the initial diagnosis was made. Over the years it has slowly increase to 40%. My last echo done 3 months ago showed a little fluid around my heart but my cardiologist was not concerned. Just recently, I have started to wheeze when laying down to sleep and shortness of breath. I have appointment to see him in a few days. My question is — does the ICD transmission indicate when there is excess fluid? I was told that it should.
The ICD doesn’t monitor fluid around the heart. Some may be able to monitor pressures in the heart to some degree.
Last December when I was 32weeks pregnant, diagnosed with pericarditis and hospitalised and drained the fluid . Doctor told it may be because of some food infection as well as they told I have pulmonary TB infection and gave 7 tablet n told to continue for 3 months.Meanwhile I got delivered with no complications and continued TB infection tablet till April.After that taken EKG and they told no fluid around the heart everything looking fine.before 2 months I got left shoulder pain but no other symptoms I faced like December.Still I requested doctor to take EKG.Result everything fine.shoulder pain due to taking baby in hands for long time n no strength post pregnancy.Taken calcium tablet shoulder pain went off.. Yesterday again I got a shoulder pain .I feel fear whether again I got pericarditis.My question is now I have take EKG?Is there any chance for fluid to come back?whether fluid will come back again n again?My fear is eating me.
Can you go and see the dr to have this evaluated and provide reassurance?
My son just had to have fluid drained from around his heart and now has to take medication but that’s about all the information he will give anyone. He hasn’t said how much fluid they had to remove or what the test results where. The only information he will give is he had to undergo an in and out surgery to have fluid drained and that he has to take medicine for it and that they don’t know how long he has had the fluid and it could’ve been caused by a hard impact to the chest, so could someone tell me more on this and how serious is it and why he would have to take medication from now on.
Im a 41yrs old woman I went to the hospital for pain in my side which was muscle spasms & they did a CT Scan & by accident found out I had fluid around my heart they said it was Precardial Effusion they drained it & got 500mL off of me & I started taking Colchicine once a day & a antibiotic called Azithromycin for 5days because my regular Doctor thinks my ear may be a ear infection.
I would recommend that you have a monitor placed to characterize the palpitations, this can be arranged through a primary care physician.
1 week later I was rushed to resist with pericarditis.
After 2 weeks in hospital I was discharged but the following day couldn’t breath and collapsed.
My wife took me to another hospital which scanned me and sent me for emergency effusion 1.5 litres was removed.
Can 1.5 litres accumulate overnight ?
Yes depending on the cause. Such a rapid accumulation would typically result in the need for emergent drainage.
Hi! A couple of weeks ago I was placed in the ICU with fluid on both lungs and my heart. I had a drain placed to remove the cardiac effusion, and the procedure went well even if I was poked in the ribs a couple of times. Not very pleasant. But just moments after they were finished, I was struck by an almost unbelievable pain in my neck and shoulders. I can’t remember anything more of that day because I was so out of it. So my question is really, is this a possible side effect of having a drain placed? Thank you!
Sounds like a nerve may have been involved temporarily when placing the drain. Not uncommon.
A CT scan to rule out another issue showed a 1.1cm fluid around heart. How much more than ‘normal’ is this amount? Is it a concern?
Its not possible to comment if it is a concern or not, it does however require investigation and surveillance.
Your article contained more helpful information than I found anywhere online. I am grateful to be able to ask your opinion on my recent diagnosis of not only Pericardial Effusion but Bilateral Pleural Effusion by Echo yesterday.
I am 65 and on 1/28/19 I had my aortic valve replaced for stenosis with a bovine valve. I expected to be in pain but I was shocked with the severe pain. My shoulders hurt so bad on the top and I could only take very shallow breaths due to the pain when trying to expand my lungs with every breath. I believed this was a common occurrence because that’s what I was told for many reasons like lying in one position for so long. I was sure they had tilted me back and shoulder supports caused this. (I later asked and found out my arms were by my side and I was flat so that blew that theory.)They were able to get my pain to a manageable level and I was breathing better so I went home on day 7. I have had a slow recovery compared to what I have read of others experiences due to continued shortness of breath and the pain with breathing which delayed my starting rehab.
By the 6th week my chiropractor had most of my physical ails straightened out and the breathing pain seemed to be getting better but I still had to take Tylenol 1000 mg 4 X daily and oxycodone at night because it hurt so badly breathing when lying down at night. My cardiologist explained about autoimmune issues causing Post Cardiotomy Syndrome but my Sed Rate and CRP were normal.
I continued with this issue over the next month with improvement so when I saw the surgeon’s PA 3/6/!9 for left sided pain under my rib anytime I coughed, sneezed, burped or breathed deeply. He prescribed Gabapentin for nerve pain for 3 weeks which took care of that thankfully. He said that by April 1st I could do anything I wanted and not to think that there was anything wrong with heart.
I noticed a few days later a burning type pain when I inhaled and soon the pain on inspiration was back but not as severe as before. I had gone out of state so couldn’t see my MD and I went back on the old pain pill schedule and after 3 weeks it seemed almost totally better. I came back to CT feeling so much better than when I left except for continued mild shortness of breath, but even that was better.
My second day back I did some vacuuming which I thought went well but that night I felt the same pain in my shoulders as I did postop again and thought I had overdone my cleaning. By the next morning however I was having pain in my chest when I breathed again. The following day I could only breathe very shallow breaths and the pain was much worse when I tried to breathe regularly. I could hardly walk from sob. My surgeon and cardiologist were both away but my cardiologist’s office had an acute care center and I was seen. My O2 sats were in low 90’s and after an Echo the covering cardiologist said I had moderate Pericardial Effusion and bilateral Pleural Effusiions caused by the surgery and an auto immune response from the cells leaking when they opened the pericardium. He prescribed Colchicine which I was just able to start tonight because of insurance issues. Today I had pain with every heartbeat as well as breathing and am extremely short of breath. When I told the office they said if I didn’t feel better by Monday to call back.
I am looking for guidance such as when should a person with my diagnosis and symptoms go to the ER? How would I know? I would feel awful wasting a doctor’s time just to be told the same thing even though I was in a lot of distress.
My surgeon didn’t close the pericardium so unless it heals back together I am confused how I have an effusion? How come my lungs are involved? Why is this continuing so long? Should I have had an Echo sooner as a routine check on my new valve function?
With it being 9 weeks since my surgery is it common for this to still be happening? Should this be a concern?
Is the decision to drain the fluid dependent upon the amount only or are their other parameters considered?
and I have had bouts of hiccoughing the past 2 weeks when I rarely do. Is this from the fluid in the pleural space?
Your symptoms and tests suggest pericarditis and the initiation of colchicine reasonable in terms of symptom management. In general one should not commonly get an effusion after surgery however it can happen and in general should be characterized. Its important to rule out collection of blood especially if one is taking blood thinner. In this case i would typically obtain an echo and a CT scan and ensure timely review by the surgical team. In terms of should you go to the er this can not be answered over such a forum, rather if worried seek help and don’t worry about wasting anyones time.

 1 0.86346 You can get the book in Kindle or Paperback here! Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is currently defined as a ‘syndrome’, a collection of symptoms for which the root cause has not yet been identified. I argue the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system. The limbic system is the primitive 'flight or fight' part of the brain which is also the start of the entire autonomic nervous system. I argue that this neurological injury is best conceived of as a state of 'hard-wired crisis' following an antecedent trauma. The traumas that lead to such a crisis state are varied and can include a viral illness, pregnancy, surgery or psychological trauma (or a combination of different kinds of trauma) - in short any kind of event that the autonomic nervous system might 'register' as traumatic. I believe that limbic system dysfunction is also responsible for many 'knock on' (or 'secondary') health effects on the body and that it can explain many aspects of pre-existing scientific research into POTS including: NET protein deficiency (which is responsible for blood vessel constriction problems and resulting elevated heart rate upon standing), low aldosterone and poor sodium retention (which are primarily responsible for low blood volume problems) and mast cell activation problems (which are responsible for the excessive release of histamine in many POTS patients). I spell out why I believe limbic system dysfunction can cause all of these problems (and more) in detail in the book and on my Youtube channel. As the limbic system is also the part of the brain which processes stimuli, the limbic system dysfunction theory can also explain why many POTS patients are sensitive to stimuli including light, sound and smell. If it is correct that POTS is caused by a limbic system impairment, then a potentially effective treatment exists in the form of the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), an intensive six month, neuroplasticity based, limbic system rehabilitation programme. The DNRS program was originally created by Annie Hopper to treat another neurological injury to the limbic system called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), a condition in which the smell centres of the brain (which are rooted in the limbic system) enter a state of chronic hyper vigilance following (usually) an initial dangerous chemical exposure. The DNRS program was later found to be effective, however, for those with POTS as well as MCS, thereby pointing to a possible shared neurological origin. I myself recovered from POTS by following the DNRS program. I am now setting about systematically gathering evidence of others who have recovered from POTS as a result of following the DNRS. Below you will find both written and video testimonials of recovery. Research by the Universities of Calgary and Alberta into the DNRS program and its effectiveness for a range of other limbic system conditions (Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) is soon to get under way. This study will also include POTS, thereby testing the limbic system impairment hypothesis. The DNRS program can either be taken as part of an intensive five day in-person program or via a DVD programme. You can find out more information about you can obtain the DNRS program below. Available now! Kindle and Paperback. E-Book is priced at USD 0.99 cent for foreseeable future. Blurb: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is currently defined as a ‘syndrome’, a collection of symptoms for which the root cause has not yet been identified. This book aims to rectify this by arguing the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system following an antecedent trauma, such as a viral illness, pregnancy, surgery or psychological trauma (or a combination). Patrick Ussher himself had POTS but recovered by following a limbic system rehabilitation program (originally developed to treat Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) called the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS). After recovery, he set about mapping the idea of a limbic system impairment onto pre-existing research into POTS and found that it could explain many key findings including: NET protein deficiency (which is responsible for blood vessel constriction problems and resulting elevated heart rate upon standing), low aldosterone and poor sodium retention (which are responsible for low blood volume problems) and mast cell activation problems. This book will simultaneously act as a guide for those interested in using the DNRS as a treatment for POTS and also as a call for further research into the potential efficacy of the DNRS for treating POTS. Patrick Ussher followed the Dynamic Neural Retraining System, an intensive six-month limbic system rehabilitation program, to recover from POTS. After he recovered, he set about mapping the idea of POTS as a form of limbic system impairment onto pre-existing scientific research into the condition, to see if it could be the ‘missing link’ which could explain the root cause of the condition. The book (POTS: What It Really Is & Why It Happens) and Youtube channel are the results of that research. He is pictured right with Annie Hopper, founder of the DNRS, at the Institute for Functional Medicine's Conference on Neuroplasticity in June 2017. Patrick was also part of the Stoicism Today project from its inception in 2012 until 2016, a collaboration of academics and psychotherapists which provided modernised Stoic resources, based on the ancient Greco-Roman philosophy as a way of life. Patrick contributed to the development of three ‘International Stoic Weeks’ (2012-2014), which were widely featured in the media including on BBC Radio, and in newspapers such as The Guardian, Forbes and The Telegraph. Patrick founded and edited the blog for the Stoicism Today project and has edited two books Stoicism Today: Selected Writings (Volumes One & Two). Patrick has a BA and MA in Classics from the University of Exeter, U.K. The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS) is a six month limbic system rehabilitation program that treats the root cause of a range of health conditions that are arguably caused by limbic system impairment following a trauma, broadly understood. Those conditions include Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Electro-Magnetic Hypersensitivity, Fibromyalgia, Food Sensitivities, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, among others. Many who take the program have more than one of these conditions and yet find the program effective for the range of conditions they may be suffering from. The program was developed by Canadian Annie Hopper who devised it to recover from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Sensitivities and Fibromyalgia. The program was later found to work for other conditions, including POTS. It is available in a DVD series and also in in-person programs. You can find more about the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS) and their DVD or In-Person Seminar Programs here.

Lauren Dinkel developed POTS after contracting mononucleosis at the age of 19. She had POTS for over four years before she found the DNRS. In the last of those four years, her condition had deteriorated to the point that she could not stand up at all, was in a ‘tilt-in-space’ wheelchair, in constant pain and unable to eat more than a handful of foods. Her heart rate in a supine position was around 135 BPM. Light and sound would give her migraines. Lauren’s hair had begun to fall out, she had become skin and bones, and she had lost all hope. Her mitochondrial cell function was on the level of an elderly woman. Her family tried everything. Lauren visited over 35 specialists and countless alternative medical practitioners, and her parents spent over $100,000 outside of their medical insurance in trying to find the answer to their daughter’s suffering. POTS was not the only condition Lauren was diagnosed with. She was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Sleep Disorders (including atypical narcolepsy), Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome along with Mast Cell Activation Problems, Movement Disorder and Non-Epileptic Seizures, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. Brittney was sick for four years. She was diagnosed with Lyme disease, POTS/dysautonomia, MCS, EMF, food allergies, PTSD, anxiety disorders and depression. She saw neurologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, naturopaths and other alternative practitioners. She had a team of medical support and extended family support which meant that there was someone with her 24/7. At the worst of her illness, she did not see the outside of her house for over a year and a half. She spent over $300,000 in pursuing different treatments, some of which helped a bit but some of which also made her condition much worse. She was in tremendous pain, unable to stand, and she would go into convulsions if she attempted to walk. Interestingly, from the point of view of this book’s hypothesis, she felt that her nervous system was ‘constantly firing off’. She also had blurry vision and was unable to eat more than five particular foods for over 18 months. Her condition deteriorated to the point where any treatment or supplement might send Brittney to the emergency room. Brittney ordered the DNRS DVDs having heard about Lauren’s website. Within the first three to four days of practicing the program, her mood improved, and she no longer felt so ‘stuck’. After several weeks, she was able to walk again, and she also gradually expanded her diet, gaining 15 pounds over six months. At that point, she attended the DNRS in-person workshop travelling on her own, reporting that her chemical sensitivity was ‘completely gone’. She even had her first glass of wine in five years! She is now getting her life back, as she puts it, ‘in ways I could never have imagined’. Another powerful DNRS video testimonial of recovery from POTS and other limbic system impairments. In this interview, the first in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Lindsay about her recovery. Lindsay's written testimonial ('My Completely Normal Tilt-Table Test') can be found below. In this interview, the second in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Jared about her recovery. Jared was in a wheelchair for a whole year at the worst of her struggles with POTS, which she developed following exposure to mold. She also had severe mast cell activation problems. With the exception of eight foods which she could eat, any other food would lead to severe reactions. She also had chemical sensitivity and electro-magnetic hypersensitivity. In this interview, she shares with us the worst of her illness and how she got better by following the DNRS program. In this interview, I talk with Nick from New Zealand who had POTS for a period of 18 months before recovering using a brain rewiring program known as 'The Switch'. We cover the symptoms he experienced, the triggering trauma, and the recovery process that unfolded following retraining the primitive part of his brain that had been affected by the initial trauma. His standing heart rate at its highest when he had POTS was 150 and just before this interview it was 82. In this interview, Michelle shares her story of POTS recovery using the limbic system retraining program The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS). Before developing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, I lived an active life as an actress. I grew up performing in plays and went to get my B.F.A. in Musical Theatre from the University of Central Florida. After college, I worked on two internships before beginning to work professionally. This is around the time when my life began to shift. The first time I had clear symptoms of POTS was after a bacterial stomach infection at the age of 22. I was still highly functioning, but could tell something was off. If I stood for too long, I would develop diarrhea. Around Summer 2012 I went to a cardiologist because I was having symptoms of a fast heart rate and skipped beats. They noticed tachycardia on a three-day monitor and decided I most likely had mild Supraventricular Tachycardia. They put me on a beta-blocker and called it
 2 0.01342 The heart has a sac around it called the pericardium. The purpose of this sac is to protect the heart from the structures that surround it. Inside the sac there is normally a small amount of fluid evenly spread in a thin layer around the whole heart. This fluid around the heart is known as pericardial fluid and basically acts as a lubricant to allow the heart to pump and turn with minimal friction. I’ll use the terms fluid around the heart and pericardial effusion interchangeably throughout this article so you become familiar with the terms. How does Excess Fluid Around the Heart Develop? There is normally a small amount of fluid around the heart (small pericardial effusion). This is produced by the sac around the heart and is an important part of normal heart functioning. Excess fluid around the heart is known as a pericardial effusion. But where does this excess fluid come from? Often, when the heart experiences inflammation (known as pericarditis) extra fluid releases and collects within the sac. It is also possible for blood to fill the sac during or after trauma, surgery, or complications of other heart procedures. Blood around the heart is known as hemopericardium. The fluid around the heart is usually continually produced and drained, so the level stays constant. Sometimes in patients with heart failure, high pressures within the heart cause the fluid not to drain properly. The body, however, continues to produce pericardial fluid, leading to excess fluid around the heart (chylous pericardial effusion). The most common cause of pericardial effusion is inflammation of the lining around the heart. In most cases, the exact caused is never found. In other cases an autoimmune reaction – where the body attacks its own cells – is the culprit. This is primarily seen in conditions like lupus and rheumatoid. Some drugs have also been associated with the development of pericardial effusion . Another caused of excess fluid around the heart is kidney disease (uremic pericardial effusion). Finally, it is relatively common to see small amounts of excess pericardial fluid during pregnancy. A bloody pericardial effusion is typically a more urgent issue and is seen as a result of blood leaking from inside the heart, or from the large vessels that leave the heart. Causes may include heart muscle tearing during a heart attack or a tearing of the great vessels leaving the heart (an aortic dissection). More rarely, a bloody pericardial effusion can result from the presence of cancer cells in the lining around the heart. In these cases, cancer typically originates elsewhere in the body and invades the heart. Imagine the sac around the heart (pericardium) to be like a hot water bottle that’s the shape of a heart that allows for a small amount of fluid to be there acting like a lubricant. If there’s a sudden, significant increase in fluid around the heart, the sac doesn’t expand. Instead, the fluid compresses the heart, as the pressure inside the sac are greater than the pressure inside the heart. This renders the heart incapable of filling with blood, essentially causing a shortage of oxygenated blood. This process is known as cardiac tamponade and can be life threatening. Cardiac tamponade only occurs if there is a sudden and significant increase in pericardial fluid or if there is a very large amount of fluid collected over time. Interestingly, it can be more dangerous for just 50cc of fluid to collect rapidly, than for 1 liter of fluid to collect over time. Why is this? When there is a slower accumulation of pericardial fluid over time, the sac around the heart slowly enlarges to accommodate the fluid – something it cannot do if there is a sudden increase. Effusions involving blood are often emergencies, because the blood may leak into the sac at high pressure. When I drain these effusions, sometimes patients are surprised that such a small amount of fluid could cause such a big problem. Other patients are amazed such a large amount of fluid (often liters) wasn’t causing noticeable problems. The main way to assess a pericardial effusion is an ultrasound scan of the heart known as an echocardiogram. The echo helps quantify the amount of fluid around the heart, tells us how the heart is handling the excess fluid, and determines what action must be taken. Sometimes features on the echocardiogram help us determine the fluid type, i.e. blood vs. other. Pericardial effusions are also commonly picked up on CT scans. CT scans are useful for determining the amount of fluid around the heart; however, echocardiograms are more effective for understanding how the pericardial effusion is affecting the heart. The treatment for pericardial effusion depends upon the amount of fluid surrounding the heart. Generally, patients with pericardial effusion are broken into three groups; mild, moderate, or large (cardiac tamponade). Unless it has occurred rapidly and led to unstable symptoms, mild pericardial effusion is usually found by chance on scans performed for other purposes. Typically a mild effusion will require no specific treatment for the effusion itself. Instead, the underlying cause is treated. The presence of an effusion may alert the physician to perform various tests to identify a cause and rule out more serious causes. For example, if the effusion is attributed to lupus, the effusion will probably resolve with treatment of lupus. The same may apply to any cause. Typically a follow-up scan is performed to ensure the effusion has resolved. Sometimes the fluid is drained and sent for analysis. The management of a moderate pericardial effusion depends on the individual case, its effect on heart function, and the presence of symptoms. In some cases, especially when the underlying cause is known and there is no significant effect on the heart function, the effusion may just be monitored over time with echocardiograms. If the effusion persists, grows larger over time, or causes symptoms it may need to be drained. The cardiologist in charge of the case will typically make this decision. Large effusions will typically be drained. After the excess fluid around the heart has been drained, a drain may be temporarily left in place to ensure further fluid does not accumulate. In some cases, particularly when effusions recur, a hole is made in the sac to allow continuous drainage. Effusions themselves don’t cause chest pain; however, effusions associated with pericarditis – inflammation of the sac around the heart – may be associated with chest pain. When do we drain the fluid around the heart? In general there are two indications to drain pericardial effusions. First, doctors remove the fluid if it is affecting heart function. Second, doctors will drain fluid around the heart to test the pericardial fluid in a lab and determine the effusions’s cause. How do we drain fluid around the heart? There are 2 main ways to do drain pericardial fluid. The first is a minimally invasive procedure – known as a pericardiocentesis – that involves passing a small tube through the skin into the lining around the heart. The fluid is drained through the tube, and a drain can be left in if required. The second is a surgical procedure that involves making a small incision underneath the breastbone. As in a pericardiocentesis, a tube is used to access the pericardial fluid, often making a small hole in the lining of the pericardial sac known as a pericardial window. The window will generally stay open over time, allowing constant drainage of the fluid to prevent accumulation. The less invasive pericardiocentesis procedure is usually tried first. Often the drain is left for up to a few days to see if the fluid builds back up. If the fluid continues to accumulate, a pericardial window procedure can be considered. Sometimes an immediate surgical approach is required, particularly in emergencies when a bloody effusion is caused by a rupture of the heart or the great vessels itself. How big is the effusion and is it affecting the function of the heart? What is the cause of the effusion? If the effusion is felt large or significant enough to be drained, what is the way in which this will be done, and what is the plan if it should come back? Finally, what is the long-term treatment plan? What Does An Echocardiogram Show? Its interesting but we often aren’t able to identify a single cause. The pain is die to inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, a condition known as pericarditis. In terms of follow up, surveillance to ensure no new development of symptoms such as dizziness, and ensuring the size of the effusion is stable over time is important. 2 causes that spring to mind are sternal wire related pain and pericarditis which is inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart, if the pain is significantly affecting you it can be addressed. I suggest seeing the surgeon that performed the operation and discussing. Hi” Doctor It’s me again Jasmine I been to three hospitals since the last time I spoke to you and they’re telling me that I may have nerve damage I’m still having pain it feel like someone is punching me in my ribs I wanted to go to Deborah heart hospital what should I do please help me. My husband had a pericardial effusion in April. While draining it off, the very agitated doctor punctured his heart and he started bleeding profusely. They had to crack open his sternum and stitch up the heart but he was in terrible pain for 6 weeks. Is this a common error? It is not common, however it is a known risk. Hi Doctor, I’m 30 weeks pregnant and my doctor just told me that my baby has fluid around his heart. What can happen because of that? Depends on the amount of fluid, its effect on heart function and why it occurred. That’s wonderful to hear & a Blessing for such a young person. As a senior I’m about to see my cardiologist for fluid around my heart I wasn’t even aware of. After having a CT scan for something else it was discovered. I hope I have the same success. Good luck to your son. I had the same problem and spent a fortune with the cardiologist who then sent me to a pulmonologist who discovered that I had an allergy . I was allergic to tea! just left emergency yesterday told small amount of fluid around heart , I have factor 5 and they injected the dye and was cleared of clot and told this , and to follow up with a cardiologist. Yes it took a couple trips to the emergency room. Hasn’t anybody heard about nutrition?A good diet is very important. We know vitamin E complex full spectrum E is good for many things including more oxygen,fighting free radicals, and the heart muscle,etc.There are good multimineral liquids.Vital.A good multi food form – food state- food bonded, are some of the terms used for true all natural vitamins. I enjoy Adelle Davis,MSc.,USC “Lets Get Well” found now on used book sites even Amazon. Surgeon attempted to add a third lead in prep for a new 3 lead icd. In doing so, he put a hole through the heart muscle into the pericardium. What is the treatment for this? A lot depends on the way it heals. If there is no damage and no persistent effusion it may be left alone, if there is persistent complication it may need to be removed. I just had CABG X4, on Feb 29th, 2016. I was discharged 7 days out and re-admitted on March 9th. 3 days later, the Surgeon drained 1400 mililiters of fluid and 4 days later on March 16th, 1250 milliliters were drained. I was discharged on March 17th. I feel as though I have fluid building back up. How likely is this? If you had surgery then collection of fluid would be odd as your pericardium has been opened and so should essentially drain on its own preventing fluid building. Sometimes leakage of blood can occur in pockets leading to a localized collection of fluid. Are you sure you aren’t referring to fluid in the lungs? Build up of that can be more common after surgery. How are they going to drain

I argue the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system. The limbic system is the primitive 'flight or fight' part of the brain which is also the start of the entire autonomic nervous system. I believe that limbic system dysfunction is also responsible for many 'knock on' (or 'secondary') health effects on the body and that it can explain many aspects of pre-existing scientific research into POTS including: NET protein deficiency (which is responsible for blood vessel constriction problems and resulting elevated heart rate upon standing), low aldosterone and poor sodium retention (which are primarily responsible for low blood volume problems) and mast cell activation problems (which are responsible for the excessive release of histamine in many POTS patients). As the limbic system is also the part of the brain which processes stimuli, the limbic system dysfunction theory can also explain why many POTS patients are sensitive to stimuli including light, sound and smell. If it is correct that POTS is caused by a limbic system impairment, then a potentially effective treatment exists in the form of the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), an intensive six month, neuroplasticity based, limbic system rehabilitation programme. The DNRS program was originally created by Annie Hopper to treat another neurological injury to the limbic system called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), a condition in which the smell centres of the brain (which are rooted in the limbic system) enter a state of chronic hyper vigilance following (usually) an initial dangerous chemical exposure. The DNRS program was later found to be effective, however, for those with POTS as well as MCS, thereby pointing to a possible shared neurological origin. I myself recovered from POTS by following the DNRS program. Research by the Universities of Calgary and Alberta into the DNRS program and its effectiveness for a range of other limbic system conditions (Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) is soon to get under way. This study will also include POTS, thereby testing the limbic system impairment hypothesis. This book aims to rectify this by arguing the case for POTS being considered a form of neurological injury to the limbic system following an antecedent trauma, such as a viral illness, pregnancy, surgery or psychological trauma (or a combination). Patrick Ussher himself had POTS but recovered by following a limbic system rehabilitation program (originally developed to treat Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) called the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS). Patrick Ussher followed the Dynamic Neural Retraining System, an intensive six-month limbic system rehabilitation program, to recover from POTS. After he recovered, he set about mapping the idea of POTS as a form of limbic system impairment onto pre-existing scientific research into the condition, to see if it could be the ‘missing link’ which could explain the root cause of the condition. The book (POTS: What It Really Is & Why It Happens) and Youtube channel are the results of that research. Patrick was also part of the Stoicism Today project from its inception in 2012 until 2016, a collaboration of academics and psychotherapists which provided modernised Stoic resources, based on the ancient Greco-Roman philosophy as a way of life. Patrick has a BA and MA in Classics from the University of Exeter, U.K. Those conditions include Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Electro-Magnetic Hypersensitivity, Fibromyalgia, Food Sensitivities, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, among others. The program was developed by Canadian Annie Hopper who devised it to recover from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Sensitivities and Fibromyalgia. The program was later found to work for other conditions, including POTS. This website contains affiliate links which means that Patrick Ussher may receive a small percentage of DNRS sales referred from this website, at no extra cost to you. Lauren Dinkel developed POTS after contracting mononucleosis at the age of 19. She had POTS for over four years before she found the DNRS. Light and sound would give her migraines. Lauren’s hair had begun to fall out, she had become skin and bones, and she had lost all hope. Her mitochondrial cell function was on the level of an elderly woman. Her family tried everything. She was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Multiple Sleep Disorders (including atypical narcolepsy), Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome along with Mast Cell Activation Problems, Movement Disorder and Non-Epileptic Seizures, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. Her condition deteriorated to the point where any treatment or supplement might send Brittney to the emergency room. Brittney ordered the DNRS DVDs having heard about Lauren’s website. At that point, she attended the DNRS in-person workshop travelling on her own, reporting that her chemical sensitivity was ‘completely gone’. Another powerful DNRS video testimonial of recovery from POTS and other limbic system impairments. In this interview, the first in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Lindsay about her recovery. In this interview, the second in a series of interviews of those who have recovered from POTS using the Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS), I talk with Jared about her recovery. Jared was in a wheelchair for a whole year at the worst of her struggles with POTS, which she developed following exposure to mold. She also had severe mast cell activation problems. With the exception of eight foods which she could eat, any other food would lead to severe reactions. She also had chemical sensitivity and electro-magnetic hypersensitivity. In this interview, I talk with Nick from New Zealand who had POTS for a period of 18 months before recovering using a brain rewiring program known as 'The Switch'. We cover the symptoms he experienced, the triggering trauma, and the recovery process that unfolded following retraining the primitive part of his brain that had been affected by the initial trauma. In this interview, Michelle shares her story of POTS recovery using the limbic system retraining program The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS). This is around the time when my life began to shift. If I stood for too long, I would develop diarrhea. They put me on a beta-blocker and called it

The heart has a sac around it called the pericardium. This fluid around the heart is known as pericardial fluid and basically acts as a lubricant to allow the heart to pump and turn with minimal friction. I’ll use the terms fluid around the heart and pericardial effusion interchangeably throughout this article so you become familiar with the terms. But where does this excess fluid come from? It is also possible for blood to fill the sac during or after trauma, surgery, or complications of other heart procedures. The fluid around the heart is usually continually produced and drained, so the level stays constant. Imagine the sac around the heart (pericardium) to be like a hot water bottle that’s the shape of a heart that allows for a small amount of fluid to be there acting like a lubricant. Instead, the fluid compresses the heart, as the pressure inside the sac are greater than the pressure inside the heart. This renders the heart incapable of filling with blood, essentially causing a shortage of oxygenated blood. Interestingly, it can be more dangerous for just 50cc of fluid to collect rapidly, than for 1 liter of fluid to collect over time. When there is a slower accumulation of pericardial fluid over time, the sac around the heart slowly enlarges to accommodate the fluid – something it cannot do if there is a sudden increase. Effusions involving blood are often emergencies, because the blood may leak into the sac at high pressure. When I drain these effusions, sometimes patients are surprised that such a small amount of fluid could cause such a big problem.
