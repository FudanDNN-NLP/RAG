  House, also known as House, M.D., is an American medical drama series which premiered on Fox on November 16, 2004. House was created by David Shore. The show follows Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an irascible, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. In a typical episode, the team is presented with an unusual case; the storyline follows the diagnosis of the patient's illness, a process often complicated by the internal competition and personal foibles of the diagnostic team. The team leader, House, frequently clashes with his boss (Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein)

  seasons 1 through 7, and Dr. Eric Foreman in season 8), and his only friend, Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). In seasons 1 through 3, House's diagnostic team includes Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). This team leaves the show in the third season finale "Human Error". The show achieved its highest ranking with the episode "Human Error"; this episode placed the series in first position for the week it aired. Each season introduces a recurring guest star, who appears in a multi-episode story arc. The fourth season was the only exception to this

After being incarcerated following the events of "Moving On", House is released on probation thanks to Foreman, who has taken Cuddy's place as the Dean of Medicine. House is initially assigned a single team member, Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi). After securing funding for his department in the season eight episode "Risky Business", House brings on former prison doctor Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and rehires Chase and Taub. Since its premiere, the show has constantly received both high ratings and critical acclaim. Eight

  Although not much is revealed about Stacy's early life, it is said in "Acceptance" that she is a Duke University graduate. Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a "Doctors vs. Lawyers" paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his

  Philanthropist Benjamin Byrd (Wentworth Miller) collapses outside of a training center for the homeless where he's made an incognito visit. When brought into Princeton Plainsboro, he offers a large payment to the hospital so that House will be able to reassemble his diagnostics team. Wilson is also placed in an ethical bind because Byrd offers a kidney to one of Wilson's needy patients. The team tries to determine whether Byrd's generosity is a symptom of mental instability, something confirmed when he offers his other kidney to Thirteen and says he's willing to live on dialysis. Dr. Jessica Adams works with House on a volunteer basis. She and Dr. Park clash over both their diagnoses of the patient and Adams' insistence on giving the proud Park increasingly large gifts, finally paying for House's car repair under the impression that it is Park's car. House reaches out to the retired Thirteen. She aids him on the case and is nearly persuaded to return to the diagnostic team full-time. He then fires her so that she can go to Greece with her new girlfriend guilt-free.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.
['The film "Vedam" is a psychological thriller that explores the themes of identity, memory, and perception. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows the story of a man named Edward (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he tries to piece together his past, he begins to uncover a web of lies and deceit that threatens to destroy everything he thought he knew about himself and the world around him.\n\nThe film is set in a dystopian future where technology has advanced to the point where memories can be implanted and manipulated. This theme is explored through the use of non-linear storytelling, with the narrative jumping back and forth in time to reveal different perspectives and truths.\n\nThe cinematography in "Vedam" is stunning, with Nolan\'s signature use of practical effects and minimal CGI. The film\'s score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is haunting and atmospheric, adding to the film\'s overall sense of unease and tension.\n\nThe performances in "Vedam" are exceptional, with DiCaprio delivering a nuanced and emotionally charged portrayal of a man struggling to come to terms with his identity. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are equally impressive, adding', 'Vedam was written and directed by Christopher Nolan.']

Then, before dinner, they get to know their host: It is Tarik (Christoph Waltz), a well-known, internationally wanted Arab terrorist, who communicates with them via interactive television. Tarik announces the "Fundamentalist Revolution", the "victory of faith over corruption", and demands one tenth of each of his hostages' fortunes. Tarik himself is in fact on the train disguised as a cook, but no one has so far found out. The captives also learn that the terrorists have

  An iconic rock legend, Jack Fate (Bob Dylan), is bailed out of prison to perform a one-man benefit concert for a decaying future North American society. The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both anarchy and Nineteen Eighty-Four-styled totalitarianism. It further reflects on life, dreams, and God's place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world. Fate makes it clear that he "was always a singer and maybe no more than that". He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents. Rather, he makes it clear that he "stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago".

When Carter takes on Sanchez as a personal client in an effort to raise funds for his indebted brother Ben (Epps), things quickly take a turn for the worse. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. Plagued by visions of his dead mother, a seance is held by Carter in order for Angel to say goodbye to his mother at which point he suffers a

 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Cast

Production

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

 4 2.18878 Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Cast

Production

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg."

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. ", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!"

The scene is intense and action-packed, with explosions, gunfire, and alien attacks. However, it also has a heartwarming moment where the agents comfort the children and assure them that they will be safe. The scene is a highlight of the movie and has been praised for its emotional impact.', 'Men in Black II stars eight children.']

  guidance counselor or a trip to the principal's office are now handled by the police. Students are denied basic constitutional rights. They can be searched, drug-tested, forced to incriminate themselves, and capriciously punished. Surveillance cameras, locker searches, and metal detectors are shown to be commonplace. Courts routinely uphold the school's right to do as they choose. The physical structure of these institutions are themselves oppressive, resembling prisons in many ways. Ironically, the film shows that the drastic measures schools employ are ineffective as tools of protection. Security cameras did nothing more than film the Columbine massacre for news outlets. This oppressiveness does nothing to advance learning. Various teachers state on camera that this atmosphere is frustrating to work in, with all curriculum handed down

  The War on Kids contends that students are denied basic freedoms based primarily on irrational fears, noting that they are searched, punished (and arbitrarily so in the crew's opinions), and forced to consume certain pharmaceutical drugs. The film begins by studying the Zero Tolerance policies in public schools in the 1990s, which were designed to eradicate drugs and weapons at schools. By arbitrary application of this policy via unchecked authority, soon nail clippers, key chains, and aspirin were considered dangerous and violations of the rules. This policy, combined with Columbine-inspired fear, has resulted in kindergartners being suspended for using pointed fingers as guns in games of cops and robbers and students being suspended for having Midol and Alka-Seltzer. Increasingly, issues once dealt with by

 Do not take painkillers if you are on drugs for high blood pressure. Taking two anti-hypertensives, a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker along with a painkiller (NSAID) significantly increases the risk of hospitalization for acute kidney injury, particularly in the first 30 days of treatment. The absolute risk may be low but one needs to be aware of it and one should use only paracetamol in this situation (BMJ).
Insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (I-T2D) patients have a greater probability of stopping insulin after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) than after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (62% vs. 34%, respectively, at 1 year), with weight-independent effects in the early months after surgery. These findings support RYGB as the procedure of choice for reversing I-T2D.

It is well known that the soul never dies and so follow your Sanskars and do good work. The aim of life should be that one should live even after the death of his or her physical body. It is your good Karmas, which keep your memories alive even after your physical death.
In Vedic language, your present is decided by your past and your future is decided by your present. To improve your future you need to work positively in your present.
When you start working positively in your present moment, you will start neutralizing your bad karmas. It is like washing a dirty shirt, which will not become stain free in one washing. Only with repeated washings can it become stain-free. Similarly washing away your bad karmas with good karmas will take time.
As per Bhagavad Gita, whatever your thoughts are at the time of death will decide the atmosphere you will get in your rebirth. It also says that whatever will be your thoughts throughout your life will be your thoughts at the time of your death.
So do not expect that you can acquire positive thoughts at the time of death if you have been thinking negative throughout your life.
The gist is to start doing good actions in the present.

Upon receiving instructions from Dr Chetan Patel, Secretary of the Disaster Management Cell of the IMA to join the pilot team being sent for providing humanitarian help to the earthquake victims in Nepal, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. Upon reaching the airport, I was introduced to the larger team comprising of doctors from various specialities and the IndiGo team who was supporting our travel for the mission. The doctors present on this special relief mission by IMA included Dr Ashok Gupta, Dr Kanchan Gupta, Dr Shashank and myself. Upon reaching Nepal, we were taken to a small place called Kirtipur, where we set up an OPD in the temple. The medicines were provided to us by Vyodhaya Hospital. We saw some critical patients who needed immediate care including one who had both of his legs crushed under a building. He was operated upon by Dr Shashank and I helped with the administration of the Anesthesia. After helping the people in this region we moved on to Sindupal, one of the worst earthquake affected districts on Day 5.
The Indian Medical Association plans to adopt a model slum area in the national capital to study the impact of safe drinking water in reduction of child deaths due to diarrhoea.
A community RO plant will be placed in the slum for a period of six months for the study. According to the IMA, about three lakh children in the country die every year before the age of three years due to diarrhoea, which can easily be prevented by providing safe drinking water.
The World Health Organisation says that water-borne diseases account for around 4.1 per cent of the total global disease burden, causing over 1.8 million deaths annually, the IMA secretary-general, Dr K.K. Aggarwal, said. “Over 88 per cent of these deaths are attributed to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. We finalised the plan to install a community RO plant, realising the need to raise urgent awareness nationally about the prevention of water-borne diseases, with a focus on safe water consumption,” said Dr Aggarwal. As per the IMA plan, in association with a water purifier manufacturer, the association will adopt a slum cluster where the community RO plant will be installed. A team of health experts from the IMA and local NGOs will closely monitor the health conditions of people residing in the locality.
“Our team will keep an eye on the deaths caused in the area due to water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea. We are doing this with only aim to reduce the number of deaths caused by water-borne diseases through mass awareness drives and educational initiatives,” added Dr Aggarwal.
The WMA has condemned unreservedly the practice in Iran of involving physicians in delivering punishment to people convicted of crimes.
The WMA urged its member associations to lobby their governments to oppose scheduling the anaesthetic agent ketamine as a controlled drug.
This was the theme of a global symposium organized by the British Medical Association, Canadian Medical Association, World Medical Association, and the UCL Institute of Health Equi­ty, which took place in London from 24 to 25 March. Participants discussed actions that can be undertaken by physicians to address health inequities among pa­tients and communities, recommendations for national medical associations, and the establishment of an international network and knowledge exchange platform focusing on social determinants of health and health equity.
Plans by the South Korean Government to allow traditional practitioners of oriental medicine to use modern medical equipment have been condemned by the World Medical Association as costly and a danger to patient safety.
The WMA has launched a public consultation on the ethical issues surrounding health databases and biobanks. The deadline for comments is 5 June 2015.
Elections also took place for key Council positions. Dr Ardis Hoven, Immediate Past President of the American Medical Association, was elected as the first female chairperson of the WMA.
During the World Immunization Week from 24 – 30 April, the World Medical Association embarked on the third phase of its global immunization campaign against seasonal influenza. In 2015, the campaign will continue to encourage physicians to act as role models for their patients and get immunized against the flu. The campaign’s secondary target will be children as one of the vulnerable groups.
The next WMA General Assembly will be held from 14 - 17 October 2015 in Moscow, Russia.
In his latest report, the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E. Méndez, focuses on children deprived of their liberty. He has examined the current legal framework protecting children from torture and ill-treatment, and identified the particular obligations of states. Even very short periods of detention can undermine a child’s psychological and physical well-being and compromise cognitive development, concludes the Special Rapporteur.
This year’s major thematic focus is on pre-trial detention, which the SPT links to a number of forms of torture and ill-treatment. The report discusses the ways in which the overuse of pre-trial detention is linked to forced confessions and the poor treatment of detainees. The report also places an emphasis on the range of different actors, including judges and prosecutors, medical professionals, and members of civil society, that must be engaged by preventive bodies if pre-trial detention numbers are to be reduced.

Doctors should boycott the makers of "Gabber is back"
On the issue of Gabber is Back, I feel it is important to locate all the doctors who are treating Akshay Kumar, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and their families to pressurize them to remove objectionable scenes against medical profession from the movie. If they do not budge then these doctors, rather all doctors should boycott these film personalities, rather all film personalities. Doctors should directly attack the goons attacking them. They can at least avoid providing non emergency outdoor treatment and home visits to the film personalities. Jogesh Gambhir, President AHPI Jharkhand.
The association has announced that it will be adopting a model slum area in Delhi-NCR where a community-RO (reverse osmosis) plant will be placed for a period of six months to study its impact in reduction of water-borne diseases.
IMA national president Dr. A Marthanda Pillai, highlighting the issue of safe drinking water for everyone, noted that there is an urgent need to raise urgent awareness nationally about the prevention of water-borne diseases with a focus on safe water consumption. IMA and a private company — which is in the field of treating drinking water — is partnering under the Association’s ‘Swachh Bharat Swasth Bharat’ campaign for this community programme.
“Through this programme, we aim to reduce number of deaths caused by water-borne diseases through mass awareness drives and educational initiatives,” he noted.
Economics Times: Mumbai: The Indian Medical Association (IMA), an umbrella body of doctors practising modern medicine, has decided to serve a legal notice to "Gabbar is Back" actor Akshay Kumar and producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali for portraying the medical profession in poor light.
Aggarwal also parried a question on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's tweet in which he described "Gabbar is Back" as "an amazing movie".
In a bid to spread public awareness about water-borne diseases, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) launched a drive here on Tuesday.
Titled "Swachh Bharat Swasth Bharat", the campaign has been launched in association with water purifier brand Kent RO.
Under the awareness drive, volunteers of the two organisations will visit rural areas of the country and make people aware about safe drinking water besides educating them about how this can help in preventing water-borne diseases.
"Though it is the primary duty of the states to provide clean and safe drinking water to the people, yet three lakh children in India die due to diarrhoeal disease every year before the age of three," said K.K. Aggarwal, honorary secretary general of IMA.
These deaths could be very easily prevented by the elimination of unsafe drinking water, Aggarwal said.
According to the World Health Organisation, water-borne diseases account for around 4.1 percent of the total global diseases burden causing 1.8 million deaths annually. Of the total, 8.8 percent is attributed to unsafe water supply and bad sanitation and hygiene.
On this occasion the IMA announced it would adopt a model slum area in Delhi and the national capital region (NCR) where a community RO plant will be placed for six months to study its impact on the reduction of water-borne diseases.
IMA today sent a Legal Notice calling for removal of objectionable scenes from the movie ‘Gabber is Back’ released on 1st May, 2015.
Padma Shri Awardee Dr A Marthanda Pillai, National President, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr S S Aggarwal, National President-Elect and Padma Shri Awardee Dr K K Aggarwal, Hony Secretary General, IMA, in a joint statement said that in accordance with the Cinematograph Act, 1952 and other provisions of law, the Director, Producer and Actor are under the obligation and have a responsibility to ensure that no movie or scene of the movie would incite or likely to incite of commission of any offence.
The said movie scene shows doctors intentionally treating a dead patient to make money. The said intentional scene in the movie has not only lowered the dignity of the medical profession, but has also provoked the public at large against the noble profession of the doctors.
The legal notice says that the Producers, Directors and Actors in order to make money create false sensations in the public, so that the movie becomes a hit, which has caused immense loss to the reputation of the doctors.
The Medical Association has demanded to immediately remove the objectionable scene from the movie ‘Gabber is Back’.
IMA has also sent a notice to the Central Board of Certification, Censor Board to ban the movie with immediate effect till objectionable scenes from the movie are removed.
The Association has also called upon the addressees to tender a written apology in national newspapers to the doctors and pay Rs. 5 crore as compensation for damaging the image of the medical profession.
A copy of our Legal Notice is attached herewith.

 The primary thematic areas of development that the Kiki scene supports for Black gay, bisexual, and transgender adolescents and emerging adults can be divided into three categories: Executive Functioning Development, Social-Emotional Development, and Physical and Emotional Safety during Development. 

In terms of Executive Functioning Development, the Kiki scene provides a supportive environment where individuals can develop important skills such as decision-making, problem-solving, and planning. The participants in the study described how being involved in the Kiki scene allowed them to take on leadership roles, organize events, and develop their communication and negotiation skills.

The Kiki scene also supports Social-Emotional Development by offering a space where individuals can find support, acceptance, and affirmation. Participants talked about the sense of belonging and community they experienced within the Kiki scene, which helped them build their self-esteem, develop a positive identity, and foster healthy relationships. The Kiki scene encourages self-expression, creativity, and celebrates diversity, allowing individuals to explore their sexuality and gender identity in a safe and accepting environment.

Furthermore, the Kiki scene promotes Physical and Emotional Safety during Development. Participants highlighted how the Kiki scene provides a space where they feel safe from discrimination, stigma, and violence that they might face in other contexts. The Kiki events were described as inclusive and welcoming, fostering a sense of physical safety, which is essential for the well-being and development of Black gay, bisexual, and transgender adolescents and emerging adults.

It is important to acknowledge that this information is based on a study conducted with participants who attended Kiki-related events, and their experiences may vary. However, this study sheds light on the positive aspects of the Kiki scene for adolescent and emerging adult development. Further research is encouraged to explore this emerging socializing force and its potential benefits to development.

 1 -0.38855 Do not take painkillers if you are on drugs for high blood pressure. Taking two anti-hypertensives, a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker along with a painkiller (NSAID) significantly increases the risk of hospitalization for acute kidney injury, particularly in the first 30 days of treatment. The absolute risk may be low but one needs to be aware of it and one should use only paracetamol in this situation (BMJ). Insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (I-T2D) patients have a greater probability of stopping insulin after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) than after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (62% vs. 34%, respectively, at 1 year), with weight-independent effects in the early months after surgery. These findings support RYGB as the procedure of choice for reversing I-T2D. Women experience less pain during insertion with an experimental nitinol intrauterine device (IUD) as compared to a copper-T IUD, and are more likely to continue using it, suggests new research presented at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Annual Clinical Meeting 2015. Women with acute asthma going to the emergency department (ED) have a two-fold increased risk of hospitalization compared to men, despite having less severe attacks and better long-term care, reported new research published online in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. MMR = measles, mumps, rubella; DM = diabetes mellitus. aWhen it is given after an injury it is considered a treatment and not a preventive measure. It is well known that the soul never dies and so follow your Sanskars and do good work. The aim of life should be that one should live even after the death of his or her physical body. It is your good Karmas, which keep your memories alive even after your physical death. In Vedic language, your present is decided by your past and your future is decided by your present. To improve your future you need to work positively in your present. When you start working positively in your present moment, you will start neutralizing your bad karmas. It is like washing a dirty shirt, which will not become stain free in one washing. Only with repeated washings can it become stain-free. Similarly washing away your bad karmas with good karmas will take time. As per Bhagavad Gita, whatever your thoughts are at the time of death will decide the atmosphere you will get in your rebirth. It also says that whatever will be your thoughts throughout your life will be your thoughts at the time of your death. So do not expect that you can acquire positive thoughts at the time of death if you have been thinking negative throughout your life. The gist is to start doing good actions in the present. New data from several studies suggest that thrombolysis may be effective in stroke patients who present later than 4.5 hours after symptom onset and who have a particular abnormality identified by sophisticated imaging techniques. The studies were presented at the recent European Stroke Organisation (ESO) Conference 2015. There may be no need for additional procedures after a patient with persistent atrial fibrillation undergoes pulmonary-vein isolation (PVI), suggests the Substrate and Trigger Ablation for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation Trial Part II (STAR AF 2). The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis during each pregnancy to protect their infants from the infection, according to new recommendations from the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI). The recommendations are published online May 11 in Pediatrics. Kids and teens who suffer a concussion worry about their academic skills in the weeks afterward, and older kids and those with more severe symptoms seem to worry the most, according to a new study reported in Pediatrics.

Upon receiving instructions from Dr Chetan Patel, Secretary of the Disaster Management Cell of the IMA to join the pilot team being sent for providing humanitarian help to the earthquake victims in Nepal, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. Upon reaching the airport, I was introduced to the larger team comprising of doctors from various specialities and the IndiGo team who was supporting our travel for the mission. The doctors present on this special relief mission by IMA included Dr Ashok Gupta, Dr Kanchan Gupta, Dr Shashank and myself. Upon reaching Nepal, we were taken to a small place called Kirtipur, where we set up an OPD in the temple. The medicines were provided to us by Vyodhaya Hospital. We saw some critical patients who needed immediate care including one who had both of his legs crushed under a building. He was operated upon by Dr Shashank and I helped with the administration of the Anesthesia. After helping the people in this region we moved on to Sindupal, one of the worst earthquake affected districts on Day 5. The Indian Medical Association plans to adopt a model slum area in the national capital to study the impact of safe drinking water in reduction of child deaths due to diarrhoea. A community RO plant will be placed in the slum for a period of six months for the study. According to the IMA, about three lakh children in the country die every year before the age of three years due to diarrhoea, which can easily be prevented by providing safe drinking water. The World Health Organisation says that water-borne diseases account for around 4.1 per cent of the total global disease burden, causing over 1.8 million deaths annually, the IMA secretary-general, Dr K.K. Aggarwal, said. “Over 88 per cent of these deaths are attributed to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. We finalised the plan to install a community RO plant, realising the need to raise urgent awareness nationally about the prevention of water-borne diseases, with a focus on safe water consumption,” said Dr Aggarwal. As per the IMA plan, in association with a water purifier manufacturer, the association will adopt a slum cluster where the community RO plant will be installed. A team of health experts from the IMA and local NGOs will closely monitor the health conditions of people residing in the locality. “Our team will keep an eye on the deaths caused in the area due to water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea. We are doing this with only aim to reduce the number of deaths caused by water-borne diseases through mass awareness drives and educational initiatives,” added Dr Aggarwal. The WMA has condemned unreservedly the practice in Iran of involving physicians in delivering punishment to people convicted of crimes. The WMA urged its member associations to lobby their governments to oppose scheduling the anaesthetic agent ketamine as a controlled drug. This was the theme of a global symposium organized by the British Medical Association, Canadian Medical Association, World Medical Association, and the UCL Institute of Health Equi­ty, which took place in London from 24 to 25 March. Participants discussed actions that can be undertaken by physicians to address health inequities among pa­tients and communities, recommendations for national medical associations, and the establishment of an international network and knowledge exchange platform focusing on social determinants of health and health equity. Plans by the South Korean Government to allow traditional practitioners of oriental medicine to use modern medical equipment have been condemned by the World Medical Association as costly and a danger to patient safety. The WMA has launched a public consultation on the ethical issues surrounding health databases and biobanks. The deadline for comments is 5 June 2015. Elections also took place for key Council positions. Dr Ardis Hoven, Immediate Past President of the American Medical Association, was elected as the first female chairperson of the WMA. During the World Immunization Week from 24 – 30 April, the World Medical Association embarked on the third phase of its global immunization campaign against seasonal influenza. In 2015, the campaign will continue to encourage physicians to act as role models for their patients and get immunized against the flu. The campaign’s secondary target will be children as one of the vulnerable groups. The next WMA General Assembly will be held from 14 - 17 October 2015 in Moscow, Russia. In his latest report, the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E. Méndez, focuses on children deprived of their liberty. He has examined the current legal framework protecting children from torture and ill-treatment, and identified the particular obligations of states. Even very short periods of detention can undermine a child’s psychological and physical well-being and compromise cognitive development, concludes the Special Rapporteur. This year’s major thematic focus is on pre-trial detention, which the SPT links to a number of forms of torture and ill-treatment. The report discusses the ways in which the overuse of pre-trial detention is linked to forced confessions and the poor treatment of detainees. The report also places an emphasis on the range of different actors, including judges and prosecutors, medical professionals, and members of civil society, that must be engaged by preventive bodies if pre-trial detention numbers are to be reduced. Military physicians everywhere often face serious problems of dual loyalty. Australia's top medical and science organisations have joined forces to call for action from the Australian government to plan for and address the impacts of climate change on human health. The report, which is backed by the Australian Medical Association (AMA), makes eight key recommendations, including programs to prevent health impacts upon the sick, the elderly, poor and those in remote communities. Two new projects have been launched by the WHO Chemical Risk Assessment Network: "Assessing immunotoxicity risk associated with exposure to nano materials” and "Review of chemical-specific adjustment factors in risk assessment". In addition, the new network train­ing database is now available, providing information on not-for-profit training courses related to human health chemical risk assessment. The WHPA will hold its biannual leadership forum on 17 May, prior to the World Health Assembly, and invites all WMA leaders to participate in the meeting. This year’s agenda will focus on the health workforce implications of policies in all sectors, and will lead to the WMA and the WHPA cooperating closely with WHO to develop their new Global Health Workforce Strategy.

Upon reaching Nepal, we were taken to a small place called Kirtipur, where we set up an OPD in the temple. He was operated upon by Dr Shashank and I helped with the administration of the Anesthesia. According to the IMA, about three lakh children in the country die every year before the age of three years due to diarrhoea, which can easily be prevented by providing safe drinking water. “Over 88 per cent of these deaths are attributed to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. A team of health experts from the IMA and local NGOs will closely monitor the health conditions of people residing in the locality. The WMA has condemned unreservedly the practice in Iran of involving physicians in delivering punishment to people convicted of crimes. This was the theme of a global symposium organized by the British Medical Association, Canadian Medical Association, World Medical Association, and the UCL Institute of Health Equi­ty, which took place in London from 24 to 25 March. The WMA has launched a public consultation on the ethical issues surrounding health databases and biobanks. Dr Ardis Hoven, Immediate Past President of the American Medical Association, was elected as the first female chairperson of the WMA. In 2015, the campaign will continue to encourage physicians to act as role models for their patients and get immunized against the flu. The campaign’s secondary target will be children as one of the vulnerable groups. The next WMA General Assembly will be held from 14 - 17 October 2015 in Moscow, Russia. In his latest report, the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E. Méndez, focuses on children deprived of their liberty. He has examined the current legal framework protecting children from torture and ill-treatment, and identified the particular obligations of states. Even very short periods of detention can undermine a child’s psychological and physical well-being and compromise cognitive development, concludes the Special Rapporteur. This year’s major thematic focus is on pre-trial detention, which the SPT links to a number of forms of torture and ill-treatment. Military physicians everywhere often face serious problems of dual loyalty. The WHPA will hold its biannual leadership forum on 17 May, prior to the World Health Assembly, and invites all WMA leaders to participate in the meeting. This year’s agenda will focus on the health workforce implications of policies in all sectors, and will lead to the WMA and the WHPA cooperating closely with WHO to develop their new Global Health Workforce Strategy. The afternoon programme will deal with the way forward in an aging society and an aging workforce. The WMA, together with the other health professionals of the WHPA, will hold the fifth World Health Professions Regulation Conference on 14 - 15 May 2016 in Geneva. They can be searched, drug-tested, forced to incriminate themselves, and capriciously punished. Surveillance cameras, locker searches, and metal detectors are shown to be commonplace.

 Harry Baldwin (Ray Milland), his wife Ann (Jean Hagen), their son Rick (Frankie Avalon), and daughter Karen (Mary Mitchel) leave suburban Los Angeles on a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada just after sunrise. After driving for two hours, the Baldwins notice unusually bright light flashes coming from a great distance behind them. Sporadic news reports broadcast on CONELRAD hint at the start of an atomic war, later confirmed when the Baldwins see a large mushroom cloud over what was Los Angeles. The family initially attempts to return to rescue Ann's mother back at their home, but they soon abandon the plan as panicked people climb over one another to escape the fallout from multiple 

 Isilugar. They fend off a Concern attack, killing agent White in the process, and Black retreats after taking Mina's partner Samba captive. The search for Samba brings Robin, Elro, and Mina to a secret Concern structure where children are being brainwashed to form the foundation of a new, cult-like society. Although they rescue Samba, Agent Black rips Elro's arm off over an old wrong and prepares to kill him, but General Chrome intervenes and has him sent to a Concern hospital, much to Black's dismay. In the chaos, Robin is thrown into an underground facility, where she is reunited with Royal. They accidentally activate and defeat a massive alien machine, but it transmits a signal up

When she was little, her family moved to Clearwater, Florida, for her father's job, where she grew up and graduated.

['Tool, the experimental rock band from Los Angeles, has won three Oscars for their short film "Lateralus" in the category of Best Animated Short Film. The film, which was directed by Jim Lima and produced by Tool\'s drummer Danny Carey, features stunning animation and a haunting score by the band.\n\nThe film tells the story of a man who is trapped in a dreamlike state, struggling to escape from a world that is both beautiful and terrifying. The animation is a masterful blend of traditional hand-drawn techniques and cutting-edge digital effects, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience.\n\nThe film\'s score, which was composed by Tool, is a haunting and atmospheric piece that perfectly complements the film\'s themes and imagery. The music is a mix of heavy guitar riffs, intricate drum patterns, and ethereal vocals, creating a sound that is both powerful and otherworldly.\n\nThe win marks a major milestone for Tool, who have been pushing the boundaries of rock music for over two decades. The band has won numerous awards and accolades over the years, but this is their first Oscar.\n\nIn accepting the award, Carey thanked the Academy for recognizing the film\'s unique vision and the hard work and dedication of the entire team. He also expressed his gratitude to the band\'s fans, who have been', 'Tool has won three Oscars.']

  2002, "Left Behind" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards, alongside "The Wizard" by Black Sabbath, "Disciple" by Slayer, "Chop Suey!" by System of a Down and "Schism" by Tool. The band's bassist Paul Gray commented that "It's cool that we're nominated. I guess it's somewhat of an honor to be nominated. I'm not really worried about if we win or not", adding that he predicted System of a Down would win the award. The Grammy was instead won by Tool for "Schism", the lead single from the band's third full-length studio album Lateralus.

  The Allmusic review by Gregory Heaney awarded the album 3.5 stars stating "The interplay between the album's intro and "Ruthless" really reinforces this idea as the intro's wall of sound falls away, allowing the bright bassline to emerge like the first light of dawn, as if to say that this is a new beginning for Ebert and company. From that moment on, the album is in an entirely different headspace from anything the band has done previously, and while Ima Robot still have a tendency to borrow from other bands, they do so in a more interesting way than they have before. The druggy "Life Is Short" feels like some kind of lost collaboration between Ween and Animal Collective, combining goofy, faux reggae with synth atmospherics in a way that makes the artsy stuff feel

  Band was born in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of the film director/producer Albert Band, the brother of director/distributor Charles Band, and the uncle of musician Alex Band. Band has been composing film music for horror and science fiction films regularly. His first notable score was for Laserblast, which he co-composed with Joel Goldsmith. His score for Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator was lauded by the magazine Music From the Movies, which said, "Band’s music is dark and direct, creating an intense and eerie atmosphere, but always with a humorous touch.... Surely, Richard Band is unquestionably one of the most underrated composers in the film business." He scored several of Gordon's subsequent films such as The Pit and the Pendulum and 1995’s Castle Freak, the later of which featured some inventive writing for a string quartet. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Gordon's Masters of Horror episode "Dreams in the Witch House". Since 2000, Band has done fewer films, though he has scored many episodes of such television shows as Stargate SG-1, Walker: Texas Ranger. He also developed the campaign music for many shows on the WB, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville.

  pushing the production to such limits, the album manages to blast through the typical production clichés to create a sonic assault […] making Periphery an album that'll give lovers of prog metal something to sink their teeth into." Richard Cartey of Rock Sound admired the band's unique amalgam of "steady lyrical patterns" through a "polyrhythmic maze" to craft their own blueprint of progressive metal but pointed out their overreliance on mimicking fellow band Sikth to attain that creative spark, concluding with, "Though there are some remarkably beautiful sections, ultimately Periphery’s palette is limited and struggles to support itself for all 73 minutes. Still, a laudably bold statement."

The ending chorus is epic; but, just when you think a conclusion is due, the abrupt ending reminds us the second part is just a few months away..." MetalSucks's Phil Boozeman gave the album 4 devil horns claiming "Automata is also a perfect jumping-on spot for new fans, as it winds up being one of the band's easiest-to-digest releases" and that "Musically, BTBAM are already in outer space while every other metal band remains stuck on earth — and yet Automata finds the band somehow continuing to push themselves in new territory". He also added that the song "Blot" "may very well represent BTBAM's strongest work to date".

 3 -9.30269  The Allmusic review by Gregory Heaney awarded the album 3.5 stars stating "The interplay between the album's intro and "Ruthless" really reinforces this idea as the intro's wall of sound falls away, allowing the bright bassline to emerge like the first light of dawn, as if to say that this is a new beginning for Ebert and company. From that moment on, the album is in an entirely different headspace from anything the band has done previously, and while Ima Robot still have a tendency to borrow from other bands, they do so in a more interesting way than they have before.

In 2013 the NFTS graduation film "Miss Todd" won the Student Academy Award for Best Foreign Film presented by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. This marked the sixth time the NFTS had won in this category, more than any other Film School outside of the United States. In 2016, The National Film and Television School once again affirmed its place as the number one international film school by winning accolades in all three categories in the CILECT Prize, the global film school awards. The NFTS won "Best Documentary" for The Archipelago, "Best Animation" for Edmond and was awarded second prize in the "Fiction" category for Patriot.
 5 -10.21805  Band was born in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of the film director/producer Albert Band, the brother of director/distributor Charles Band, and the uncle of musician Alex Band. Band has been composing film music for horror and science fiction films regularly. His first notable score was for Laserblast, which he co-composed with Joel Goldsmith. His score for Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator was lauded by the magazine Music From the Movies, which said, "Band’s music is dark and direct, creating an intense and eerie atmosphere, but always with a humorous touch.... Surely, Richard Band is unquestionably one of the most underrated composers in the film business." He scored several of Gordon's subsequent films such as The Pit and the Pendulum and 1995’s Castle Freak, the later of which featured some inventive writing for a string quartet. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Gordon's Masters of Horror episode "Dreams in the Witch House". Since 2000, Band has done fewer films, though he has scored many episodes of such television shows as Stargate SG-1, Walker: Texas Ranger. He also developed the campaign music for many shows on the WB, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville.

  critics who gave the film overall negative reviews singled out Watson for praise, with Peter Howell of the Toronto Star stating, "The undistinguished young cast of The Bling Ring has just one standout, and that's Emma Watson, who plays one of the most vacuous of the juvenile thieves. We know her best as the brainy Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter movies, and she can obviously do brainless equally well." Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News wrote, "Watson, though, does a great imitation of hollow-eyed gaze; her character is the one who tries to parlay notoriety into success (everyone else can, she figures). The one-time Harry Potter star captures the slack-jawed fan only too well."

Born Vincent Damon Furnier in Detroit, Michigan, in 1948, Cooper began his career as a musician in the 1960s. He formed his first band, The Spiders, in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, and later changed the name to Alice Cooper, after the lead singer.\n\nIn 1969, Cooper\'s band signed a record deal with Frank Zappa\'s Straight Records, and their debut album, "Pretties for You," was released in 1969. The album was a commercial failure, but it established Cooper\'s unique style of horror-themed rock music.\n\nOver the next few years, Cooper and his band released several successful albums, including "School\'s Out" (1972) and "Billion Dollar Babies" (1973). These albums helped to establish Cooper as a major force in the music industry, and he became known for his elaborate stage shows, which often included guillotines, snakes, and other shocking elements.\n\nIn the 1980s, Cooper\'s popularity began to wane, and he struggled to find success in the changing music landscape. However, he continued to release albums and tour, and he remained a', 'Alice Cooper has been working in his field for over 50 years.']

  Born in Akron, Ohio, Buxton moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and in 1964, while attending Cortez High School, made his debut in a rock band called The Earwigs. It was composed of fellow high school students Dennis Dunaway, Vincent Furnier, John Tatum and John Speer. At the onset, Buxton was the only member who could play an instrument, and thus taught some of the other members to play after the group decided to take a shot at becoming a real band. They became popular locally, and changed their name to The Spiders in 1965 and later to The Nazz in 1967. In 1966-67, guitarist John Tatum and drummer John Speer left the group, and rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Bruce and drummer Neal Smith joined. In 1968, to avoid legal entanglements with the Todd Rundgren-led Nazz the group changed their name to Alice Cooper, premiering their new name at their performance at the Santa Barbara County Fairgrounds on March 20, 1968.

He is credited as lead guitarist on seven albums by Alice Cooper, including the chart-topping Billion Dollar Babies. However, he was "not invited" to play on 1973's Muscle of Love and does not appear, although he is credited due to management's concerns about band image with the fans. According to drummer Neal Smith, the absence was due to "problems that Glen was having with the demons of rock and roll at that particular time..."

  The Eyes of Alice Cooper, released in 2003, is the sixteenth solo album by Alice Cooper. With this album, Cooper returned to his earlier hard rock sound, in the vein of The Last Temptation, and left the heavy industrial metal sound found in his last two studio albums. Of note is the album cover, which was released in four different versions, featuring alternate colours in Cooper's eyes and the crescent around the 'A' in the title. It was available in blue, green, purple and red. In the 2010 Behind the Music Remastered on Alice Cooper, "Between High School & Old School" was described as "a modern Alice Cooper classic" for its return to the topic of school (a reference to "School's Out").

He created 'School's Out'. He created all that stuff." In a separate interview, Cooper stated, "Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, 'What is that line? It's so weird, but it's catchy.' Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake."

Most of the tracks feature unusual time signatures and arrangements, jarring syncopation, expressive dynamics, sound effects, and an eclectic range of music influences.

The band sought out other guitar players to fill in, 

 Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over 50 years. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers to be "The Godfather of Shock Rock". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.

  Reaction to the documentary prompted the bands and singers Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, The Beach Boys, Trace Adkins, and Trisha Yearwood to cancel their concerts at the "Bands, Brew & BBQ" event at SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in 2014. The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, "Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now." Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.

  Following the release of Incredibles 2, director Brad Bird acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of Toy Story 4 and Incredibles 2, which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. "There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another Incredibles film, or something else." Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer John Walker would not "rule [a third film] out".

2024-06-13 06:50:14 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton with co-direction by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Bob Peterson, David Reynolds, and Stanton from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, and Willem Dafoe. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin who, along with a regal blue tang named Dory, searches for his missing son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself. Released on May 30, 2003, Finding Nemo won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including 

 Reaction to the documentary prompted the bands and singers Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, The Beach Boys, Trace Adkins, and Trisha Yearwood to cancel their concerts at the "Bands, Brew & BBQ" event at SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in 2014.

['Stephen Colbert, the host of "The Late Show" on CBS, is a comedian, writer, producer, and television personality. Born in Washington, D.C., in 1964, Colbert attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia and later earned a master\'s degree in philosophy from the Catholic University of America. After working as a writer and performer for "The Dana Carvey Show" and "The Daily Show," Colbert became a correspondent for "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" in 1997. He was promoted to anchor of the show\'s "The Colbert Report" segment in 2005, which he hosted until 2014. Colbert\'s satirical news commentary style and conservative persona earned him critical acclaim and a large following. In 2015, he took over as host of "The Late Show" on CBS, replacing David Letterman. Colbert\'s guests have included politicians, actors, musicians, and other celebrities, such as Barack Obama, George Clooney, Lady Gaga, and Paul McCartney.\n"""\n\n\nPassage:"""\nStephen Colbert, the host of "The Late Show" on CBS, is a comedian, writer, producer, and television personality.

  Prior to Colbert's assumption of hosting duties, David Letterman had been host of Late Show for 22 years, dating to his arrival at CBS in 1993. CBS had not had a regular late-night talk show for most of its existence before that point, with only one attempt (the short-lived Pat Sajak Show in 1989–90) between 1972 and Letterman's arrival. Letterman, who joined CBS from NBC after ending his eleven-year run as host of Late Night and losing out on being Johnny Carson's successor on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, was initially competitive with his show's bitter rival, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; Letterman's Late Show, however,

  The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is an American late-night talk show hosted by Stephen Colbert, which premiered on September 8, 2015. Produced by Spartina Productions and CBS Studios, it is the second iteration of CBS' Late Show franchise. The program is taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and airs live to tape in most U.S. markets weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT, as with its competitors Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Colbert was announced as the new host in April 2014, after existing host David Letterman announced his intention to retire earlier in the month; Colbert had previously hosted

  talk shows, which may have led to CBS' decision to pick a younger replacement for Letterman to compete with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In addition, Colbert's previous program did well among college students and young men 18–34, which are prime target audiences for late-night comedy programming. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement, with his final episode as host of Late Show scheduled for May 20, 2015. On April 10, 2014, CBS announced Stephen Colbert as Letterman's successor, signing him to a five-year agreement. In contrast with Colbert's previous program The Colbert Report, in which he played a fictionalized

  Colbert has been given near-full control of the show, with little interference from CBS management in regard to format. Colbert brought most of his staff from The Colbert Report with him to The Late Show, as well as outsiders such as Brian Stack, who is best known for his work on Conan O'Brien's programs, and Jon Stewart, former host of Colbert's previous sister program The Daily Show, who is credited as executive producer. Colbert no longer uses the character he had portrayed on The Colbert Report, jokingly remarking to Jeb Bush that "I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit – now I'm just a narcissist."

  Stephen Colbert succeeded Letterman as host on September 8, 2015, having been signed to a five-year contract. In contrast with Colbert's previous program, The Colbert Report, in which he played a fictional character also named Stephen Colbert, Colbert hosts the show (which retains the Late Show branding) as himself. Several cities sought to acquire the Late Show, among them New York City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Connecticut. A report in the Daily News indicated that CBS Corporation had paid over $40,000 in campaign contributions to incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo in an effort to lobby the governor for certain tax breaks to keep the show in New York City. A deal to keep the show at the Ed Sullivan Theater, which includes $16,000,000 in state tax incentives over a five-year period, was made official on July 23, 2014. Jon Batiste is the bandleader on Colbert's iteration of the program.

Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that November, Colbert devoted his program to that city.

Also, the show follows the same basic format as other late-night talk shows including the use of sketch comedy, guest interviews and musical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and government figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests included visits from Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Ban Ki-moon, Stephen Breyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz.
