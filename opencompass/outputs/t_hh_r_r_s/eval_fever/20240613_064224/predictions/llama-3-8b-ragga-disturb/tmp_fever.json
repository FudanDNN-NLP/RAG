David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.
