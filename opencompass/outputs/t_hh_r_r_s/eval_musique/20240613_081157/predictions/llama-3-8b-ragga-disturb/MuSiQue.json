Most European countries have a system of tightly regulated, competing private health insurance companies, with government subsidies available for citizens who cannot afford coverage. Countries in western Europe have had a significant increase in life expectancy since World War II, while most of eastern Europe and the former Soviet countries have experienced a decrease in life expectancy. European Union\nThe European Union has no major administrative responsibility in the field of healthcare. Both the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are involved in public health development in Europe. Finding an approach that balances effectiveness, efficiency, and successful response to the pandemic is the key to ending the crisis. European Union countries like Greece and Sweden have similar populations and sizes. They have a difficult cultural and political stance. The government response of various European countries to the pandemic was to stay home and slow down the spread of the virus. The governmental response including the banning of all international non-essential travel and lockdowns helped to keep the death toll to a minimum. In comparison, the government response to COVID-19 in Sweden was much less stringent than in Greece. The Public Health Agency of Sweden proposed a ban on gatherings over 500 people, including social distancing. The key concept proposed was solidarity through individual responsibility with all Swedish citizens obeying the guidelines. Triaging issues that determined medical priority to increase survival rates from COVID-19 contrasted between Sweden and Greece. The Europeans focused strictly on medical protocols and technical expertise from the medical field. This caused a fundamental collapse of the healthcare system, needless deaths, and a misinformed and distrusting public that demanded more accountability from the European Union members, the government, and health professionals. As of December 10, 2021, there have been 18,982 deaths in Greece and 15,152 deaths in Sweden. For example, Eastern Europe is a low-income region, with a lower life expectancy due to biological factors including genetics, nutrition, and even hormonal issues. The consumption of alcohol in Europe by men is usually more common between the ages of 20–34 years in men and would increase the life expectancy if consumption is lowered. Europe and its members have been actively contributing to handling this pandemic most simply. Europe has been following the \"herd immunity\" strategy which convinces its citizens to get vaccinated as soon as possible. In Europe, there is a limited number of vaccinations that are being offered for the people. Europe has since taken precautions to distribute vaccines safely and effectively across the country.

It would combine national armies and allow West Germany to rearm under the control of the new Community. However, in 1954, the treaty was rejected by the French National Assembly. The rejection also derailed further plans for a European Political Community, being drawn up by members of the Common Assembly which would have created a federation to ensure democratic control over the future European army.

In 1927, the French politician Emil Borel, a leader of the centre-left Radical Party and the founder of the Radical International, set up a French Committee for European Cooperation, and a further twenty countries set up equivalent committees.

It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016. Plot Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. Révol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. Révol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Characters Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated.

After the critical acclaim and commercial success of his first novel Flood, Vachss was contacted by Robert Gottlieb, then editor-in-chief of the New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf, and signed a contract with an advance of US$175,000 for Strega. The novel subsequently won the 1988 Grand Prix de Littérature Policière, a prestigious French award for mystery and crime novels, and the 1989 Falcon Award by the Maltese Falcon Society of Japan. The Heart is a 2014 realistic and medical fiction novel by the French author Maylis de Kerangal. It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016. Plot Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. Révol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. Révol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Characters Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. He is currently separated from Marianne due to the demanding nature of his job and the consequential strain it placed on their marriage. He also blames himself for introducing his son to surfing, which is what led to the fatal car accident that took his life. She is selected to received Simon's heart after being placed on the Biomedical Agency's priority list of recipients due to her state of acute deterioration. While Claire is ecstatic about finally receiving a new heart, she is also afraid of the pain and the possibility of death from the operation, and of the loss of her identity. He oversees Simon's case and declares him officially brain-dead. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with\n\n"

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed health system building blocks, which are now widely recognized as essential components of health systems strengthening. With increased travel and urbanization, the threat of emerging diseases of pandemic potential is increasing alongside endemic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis virus infections. We describe two ways that health ministries in developing countries could leverage President Obama’s Global Health Initiative (GHI) to build public health surveillance and response systems using proven models for public health systems strengthening and to create the public health workforce to operate those systems. We also offer suggestions for how health ministries could strengthen public health systems within the broad health systems strengthening agenda. Despite increased interest in strengthening health systems for developing countries, the current reality is that the health systems in most developing countries fall short of the requirements to implement the goals suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR). One of the greatest obstacles that countries face is a clear understanding of the steps that are needed to strengthen a health system. To address this issue, the WHO has proposed health system building blocks which are now widely recognized as essential components of health systems strengthening . These building blocks include service delivery, financing, governance, the health workforce, information systems, and supply management systems. The WHO has also recently launched an intervention to address the alarming shortage of health workers in developing countries, which includes curative and preventive public health staff . Against a backdrop of endemic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis virus infections, epidemiologic patterns are shifting, giving rise to significant increases in disease burden due to of non-communicable diseases. However, when officials seek to address these public health issues, they are faced with several interrelated problems including human resource capacity, disease surveillance and reporting capacity, and response capacity. We describe two ways that health ministries in developing countries could leverage U.S. President Obama’s Global Health Initiative (GHI), to build public health systems using proven models for public health systems strengthening and create the public health workforce to operate those systems. We also offer suggestions for how health ministries could strengthen public health systems within the broad health systems strengthening agenda. GHI will provide an opportunity for major investments in sustainable health systems strengthening and public health systems strengthening in developing countries. With an estimated USD 63 billion investment in global health, GHI will be the principal engine for global health development for the foreseeable future. We believe that these new health workers will need to respond by providing both treatment and preventive service, and that the number of public health workers needed to make a significant change in the operation of public health systems is substantially less than number of health care workers needed for curative health care services. While the focus of public health system strengthening has previously been aimed at treatment of disease, the advent of emerging pandemics necessitates incorporation of other specialties including epidemio-logic, laboratory and management expertise. reduction in morbidity and mortality from priority diseases in the host country. At the sub-national level, a province, or region, comprised of several districts is commonly the point of primary public health program implementation. These graduates should be working together within a provincial disease surveillance and disease control unit reporting to the provincial medical director and with a complement of district-based frontline staff that are trained in basic field epidemiology and public health laboratory practice as they jointly operate public health systems within the province. Larger provinces may need to have more graduates to address specific diseases and graduates may even be deployed at the district level in smaller countries. Some health ministries may need to train a cadre of public health managers and logisticians for the public health systems to operate efficiently. The national and provincial multi-disease surveillance and disease control departments and units would form the network through which these essential public health functions would be conducted. We believe that a country would have an adequate coverage of public health workers trained in the FETP or FELTP if there are three to five graduates per million inhabitants in the country, to reach adequate coverage an FETP or FELTP would need to be operating for more than 5-10\n\nAlthough competency-based medical education has become the standard for physician training in the West, many developing countries have not yet adopted competency-based training. In 2009 in the United Arab Emirates, the government regulatory and operational authorities for healthcare in Abu Dhabi mandated a wide-scale reform of the emirate’s postgraduate residency programs to the competency-based framework of the newly formed Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International (ACGME-I). This article briefly describes the rationale for competency-based medical education and provides an overview of the transition from traditional, time-based residency training to competency-based postgraduate medical education for the Pediatrics residency programs in Abu Dhabi. We will provide data on the initial impact of this transition on resident performance and patient outcomes in a Pediatrics residency program in an academic medical center in the United Arab Emirates. In the century since Halstead and Osler redefined postgraduate training in the United States, countries throughout the world have reformed their medical education systems to be more responsive to the changing needs of society. Regulatory bodies worldwide, including the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in the United States, the General Medical Council (GMC) in the United Kingdom, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), have responded by developing national educational change initiatives grounded in competency-based medical education (CBME). With the 21st century globalization of medicine, these Western-developed frameworks have significantly influenced postgraduate medical training in the East. The CanMEDS model has been adopted extensively around the world . More recently, several countries, including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, have restructured their residency training programs around the core competencies of the US-based Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education- International (ACGME-I). Although academic scholars continue to debate over the educational and clinical outcomes of competency-based education, it has become the worldwide standard for postgraduate training of physicians. By aligning the requisite competencies desired in health professional trainees with each country’s health care priorities, competency-based training directly integrates graduate medical education (GME) with the health and healthcare needs of populations [2,3]. Outcomes-based learning was first introduced as an instructional strategy by behavioral psychologists as early as the 1950′s , but it was not uniformly adopted until decades later when several influential reports called for a transition to competency-based training and regulatory bodies such as the ACGME and the RCPSC mandated CBME as a requirement for accreditation [5,6]. These benefits are particularly important in countries with developing healthcare systems, who are actively building a health professional workforce. This article presents an overview of the educational restructuring and describes the key elements of the transition to competency-based training in the Pediatrics residency training programs in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 2010–2013. While we cannot definitely determine cause and effect, we will also provide data on the initial impact of this transition on resident performance and patient outcomes in a Pediatrics residency program in an academic medical center in the UAE as an early case study. In Abu Dhabi, postgraduate training in Pediatrics is offered in four of the five government teaching hospitals. Without central oversight, standardized curricula and assessments, or guidelines for promotion, inconsistencies developed in the quality of training and in the competence of graduates. Every program faced issues with resident recruitment and retention, and Arab Medical Board pass rates were consistently low. In a country with an ever increasing annual birth rate, the quantity and quality of graduating pediatricians became an issue of national concern. As such, in addition to traditional teaching, we incorporated supervision and mentoring of trainees as explicit faculty responsibilities. Teaching has also become a component of the job descriptions and appraisals of all Pediatricians in our teaching hospitals. This lies in stark contrast to the autonomy of the previous apprenticeship model of training to which our residents were accustomed. Graduate medical education in the UAE has historically focused on acute illness and exacerbations of chronic disease. International training programs, especially those in developing regions, may lack the resources and expertise to train physicians in all domains, thereby, emphasizing the need to break down silos and develop collaborative training programs. In 2010, a Lancet Commission on education of health professions for the 21st century put forward a vision that “all health professionals in all countries should be educated to mobilize knowledge and to engage in critical reasoning and ethical conduct so that they are competent to participate in patient-centered health systems as members of locally responsive and globally connected teams.” Healthcare in the UAE already has a long history of international collaborations, including relationships with the Imperial College of London, Johns Hopkins International and the Cleveland Clinic. We also participated in international educational cooperations and global exchange programs for our students and teachers. It is our hope that UAE teaching programs will, in turn, share resources and partnerships with less developed medical education systems, both within and outside the Arab world. In the UAE, undergraduate medical education continues to be comprised of long hours in the classroom and frequent written examinations, but limited hands-on training. The clinical clerkship in Pediatrics provided a critical opportunity to involve students in the active supervised care of the pediatric patient and for introducing students to unfamiliar concepts, such as systems based practice and quality improvement principles, thereby providing the medical school graduates with the requisite competencies for\n\n  The equal right to education for men and women is guaranteed by Myanmar’s Constitution. In 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military rule. Between 2008 and 2013, because of the government's encouragement of education policies, Myanmar saw a rise in the number of girls attaining education. Currently, there are more women than men in Myanmar's education system. The literacy rate for adult women is 86% compared to just over 90% for men. Despite the progress, there are continued traditional cultural barriers that prevent women from capitalizing on their education attainment. There are extreme disparities between urban and rural educational performance. The Shan State region of Myanmar has the lowest female literacy rates at 59.4%.Additionally while a growing proportion of women are pursuing higher education this number does not match the future employment fate of women, where men make the larger proportion of those in the workforce. Moreover, women still do not occupy senior levels of economic decision making, despite their high education. The impaired quality of higher medical education in post-Soviet territories can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there has been an unjustified growth in the number of students without a corresponding increase in the resources and teaching capacity to effectively educate them. This has led to overcrowded classrooms and limited access to practical training, ultimately affecting the quality of education. Secondly, there has been a loss of motivation to study among students. This can be attributed to the lack of proper career guidance and limited prospects for specialization or career advancement within the medical field. This has resulted in a decline in the overall quality of education and the competence of graduates. The Bologna system aims to address these issues by introducing certain reforms in higher education. One of the key aspects of the Bologna system is the implementation of two-level training systems. Furthermore, the Bologna system emphasizes competency-based education. It is important to note that the competency-based model, which is considered an exclusively European innovation, has actually been borrowed from the Soviet higher education system. In conclusion, the Bologna system offers possibilities for improving the quality of higher medical education in post-Soviet territories by introducing two-level training systems and competency-based education. However, careful consideration and adaptation of these principles are necessary to effectively address the specific challenges faced in each country or region. Address the ongoing increase in medical school production (through the addition of new schools, addition of branch and regional campuses to existing schools, and increases in medical school class size) and graduate medical education funding policies, and their anticipated impact on family medicine workforce. For this reason, accurate health workforce projections remain elusive and controversial. There are multiple calls for health system reform. One example is the 2012 Institute of Medicine report calling for an exploration of primary care and public health integration to improve the health of individuals, communities, and populations.11 A condition for any meaningful reform is a clearly articulated health workforce policy. Cultural and ethnic changes will continue as the population becomes increasingly diverse. Many nationally recognized groups, including the Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Pew Health Professions Commission, have called for at least 40 percent of U.S. medical graduates to enter generalist careers.18-24 In 2006, the AAFP completed a comprehensive workforce study that identified the ideal ratio of family physicians to population calculated from a needs-based model.7 However, many other factors, such as the demographic changes of the U.S. population, new models of healthcare, achieving recommended health screenings, aging physician demographics and practice patterns, and health reform measures that may include expanded insurance coverage will affect the workforce need. Attention also must be paid to ensure that the increasing number of graduates will provide the kind of care most needed. The evidence for the efficiency of health systems based on robust primary care is compelling. A 10-year national plan should target at least 40 percent of the total number of U.S. physicians to practice in true primary care specialties (Family Medicine, General Pediatrics, and General Internal Medicine).18 True primary care practice should be measured by the clinical practice of family physicians, general internists, and general pediatricians five years after medical school completion. The United States should increase payments to family physicians for clinical services in order to attract them to and sustain them in the new model of family medicine, and to promote improvement in health care delivery outcomes.\n\nQuestion: What was the average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

International training programs, especially those in developing regions, may lack the resources and expertise to train physicians in all domains, thereby, emphasizing the need to break down silos and develop collaborative training programs. In 2010, a Lancet Commission on education of health professions for the 21st century put forward a vision that “all health professionals in all countries should be educated to mobilize knowledge and to engage in critical reasoning and ethical conduct so that they are competent to participate in patient-centered health systems as members of locally responsive and globally connected teams.” Healthcare in the UAE already has a long history of international collaborations, including relationships with the Imperial College of London, Johns Hopkins International and the Cleveland Clinic. We also participated in international educational cooperations and global exchange programs for our students and teachers. It is our hope that UAE teaching programs will, in turn, share resources and partnerships with less developed medical education systems, both within and outside the Arab world. In the UAE, undergraduate medical education continues to be comprised of long hours in the classroom and frequent written examinations, but limited hands-on training. The clinical clerkship in Pediatrics provided a critical opportunity to involve students in the active supervised care of the pediatric patient and for introducing students to unfamiliar concepts, such as systems based practice and quality improvement principles, thereby providing the medical school graduates with the requisite competencies for\n\n  The equal right to education for men and women is guaranteed by Myanmar’s Constitution. In 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military rule. Between 2008 and 2013, because of the government's encouragement of education policies, Myanmar saw a rise in the number of girls attaining education. Currently, there are more women than men in Myanmar's education system. The literacy rate for adult women is 86% compared to just over 90% for men. Despite the progress, there are continued traditional cultural barriers that prevent women from capitalizing on their education attainment. There are extreme disparities between urban and rural educational performance. The Shan State region of Myanmar has the lowest female literacy rates at 59.4%.Additionally while a growing proportion of women are pursuing higher education this number does not match the future employment fate of women, where men make the larger proportion of those in the workforce. Moreover, women still do not occupy senior levels of economic decision making, despite their high education. The impaired quality of higher medical education in post-Soviet territories can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there has been an unjustified growth in the number of students without a corresponding increase in the resources and teaching capacity to effectively educate them. This has led to overcrowded classrooms and limited access to practical training, ultimately affecting the quality of education. Secondly, there has been a loss of motivation to study among students. This can be attributed to the lack of proper career guidance and limited prospects for specialization or career advancement within the medical field. This has resulted in a decline in the overall quality of education and the competence of graduates. The Bologna system aims to address these issues by introducing certain reforms in higher education. One of the key aspects of the Bologna system is the implementation of two-level training systems. Furthermore, the Bologna system emphasizes competency-based education. It is important to note that the competency-based model, which is considered an exclusively European innovation, has actually been borrowed from the Soviet higher education system. In conclusion, the Bologna system offers possibilities for improving the quality of higher medical education in post-Soviet territories by introducing two-level training systems and competency-based education. However, careful consideration and adaptation of these principles are necessary to effectively address the specific challenges faced in each country or region. Address the ongoing increase in medical school production (through the addition of new schools, addition of branch and regional campuses to existing schools, and increases in medical school class size) and graduate medical education funding policies, and their anticipated impact on family medicine workforce. For this reason, accurate health workforce projections remain elusive and controversial. There are multiple calls for health system reform. One example is the 2012 Institute of Medicine report calling for an exploration of primary care and public health integration to improve the health of individuals, communities, and populations.11 A condition for any meaningful reform is a clearly articulated health workforce policy. Cultural and ethnic changes will continue as the population becomes increasingly diverse. Many nationally recognized groups, including the Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Pew Health Professions Commission, have called for at least 40 percent of U.S. medical graduates to enter generalist careers.18-24 In 2006, the AAFP completed a comprehensive workforce study that identified the ideal ratio of family physicians to population calculated from a needs-based model.7 However, many other factors, such as the demographic changes of the U.S. population, new models of healthcare, achieving recommended health screenings, aging physician demographics and practice patterns, and health reform measures that may include expanded insurance coverage will affect the workforce need. Attention also must be paid to ensure that the increasing number of graduates will provide the kind of care most needed. The evidence for the efficiency of health systems based on robust primary care is compelling. A 10-year national plan should target at least 40 percent of the total number of U.S. physicians to practice in true primary care specialties (Family Medicine, General Pediatrics, and General Internal Medicine).18 True primary care practice should be measured by the clinical practice of family physicians, general internists, and general pediatricians five years after medical school completion. The United States should increase payments to family physicians for clinical services in order to attract them to and sustain them in the new model of family medicine, and to promote improvement in health care delivery outcomes.\n\n"

Career \nMota moved to the United States after her PhD to postdoc at the New York University Medical Center in the lab of Victor Nussenzweig. In 2005 Mota was made a professor at the University of Lisbon. In 2016 Mota was elected a member of EMBO. Mota was the lead researcher of the first study to demonstrate that malaria parasites, when they enter the liver early in infection, enter and traverse through multiple liver cells before finding a cell that they stay in for replication. This work was based on a serendipitous discovery made from a conversation between Mota and Ana Rodriguez in a lift, about an old film Rodriguez had from a previous research project. In 2005 Mota was appointed Commander of the Order of Prince Henry (Comendadora da Ordem do Infante D. Henrique), a national honour of Portugal. Mota is one of the youngest recipients of the prestigious award.

You can check it out and probably find lots of others to chat with...there's only a few of us left here. I did find the FB page, but I love going through all the posts here. I really hope to get some information at my visit on Thurs. Depending on where you're at you might want to consult with Dr. Spetzler in phoenix and/or Dr. Awad in Chicago. It's what I've pieced together over the past week. I've never had to second opinion anything like this. Do I cold-call these guys' offices? Yes, call their offices and they will tell u what u need to send them...and where to send. I wanted to update you. My doctor's office sent over a referral to Dr Awad's office, and they called me the next day (Friday) to schedule an appointment on Monday. (HOLY FAST!!). So I'm scheduled for March 2. He also told me to treat this area of my back as \"brittle\" and no working out, yoga. That was startling. I also sent a records review to Dr. Spetzler and he concluded as well that it needed to come out. Thank you so much for recommending these two doctors. I hate waiting on medical conditions, and this helped me out tremendously! Many thanks to Bill Devanney for driving me to San Francisco today. He hung around the waiting rooms for a long time! I saw the medical oncologist first. She wants to do a biopsy on the rib lesion because it's the easiest to access with the least amount of risk. I will probably have the biopsy within the next three weeks. There was concern that I've lost 20 pounds in two months. I met with the neurosurgeon later in the day and praise God, my neck is healing very well! The neurosurgeon's exact words were, \"It looks very good!\" I will follow up with him in six weeks and there's a good chance that the brace will be removed for good then. . . We continue to give God praise for all that He's doing in our lives. We continue to ask him to teach us *his* will for our lives and not our own. My constant prayer to him is for him to continue to teach me how to love his people. I was going to try to write something witty and clever or whatever and I just don't have it in me right now. I am grateful for treatment options such as this that help deal with pain relief, etc. I feel much better than I did four weeks ago when I started . . . at least, cancer-wise, I feel better. I am exhausted and my throat is riddled with sores, making it extremely difficult to swallow. Things should steadily improve over the next two weeks. I will see both the oncologist and neurosurgeon on Monday (the 25th) for blood work and for xrays to get a preliminary look at how my neck is healing. In the meantime, the kids and I have had a good week with their winter break, while Art's been traveling on business. . . . . The pain medications are working well to manage the throat pain. I also set aside a couple of times of day to just eat, knowing that I'm never going to feel like eating with this throat, but eating for nutrition. In addition, I find myself needing to go to bed earlier each day. My neurosurgeon called yesterday and he's got me set up for follow-up x-rays on the 25th. I will also see the oncologist on the 25th. After that, Art and I will spend the day in the city, celebrating my 50th birthday. . .

Some time later I was in Birmingham to see my doctor about a thyroid problem, and I thought to show it to him. I went over to a dermatologist in Decatur, and he diagnosed me as soon as he saw it. I can say that I'm one of the few cases that ever got a diagnosis so soon; I've met a lot of people since then who have scleroderma, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other things like that, and every one of them got diagnosed with something else before their doctors finally got it right. The doctor told me a couple of interesting things about scleroderma: he said it's a rare disease, that it's even rarer for someone my age to get it, and rarer yet because I am a man. Most victims are twenty to forty years old, and 80 percent of them are women. He said to me, \"I'll bet you thought you had cancer.\" I said, \"Well, I've seen enough cancer patients in my life, and I did think that's what it was.\" \"He said he didn't know of anyone who had ever gotten over it, and he didn't know any place I could go to see a doctor who could give me any help. \"But I will tell you this,\" he said. \"I asked him why he said that.I told him the little amount I had on my leg didn't hurt at all, and I had heard that cancer was really painful. @pattismith, thanks for sharing your experience with Amitriptyline. In the past few days, I ran across the following snippet. I think what it says about Amitriptyline is the likely explanation for what you experienced all those years ago. I was taken by the cavalier attitude in the last sentence of the second paragraph. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), like citalopram (Celexa) and duloxetine (Cymbalta), are commonly used to treat depression in people of all ages. First of all, @Wayne, I'm very glad to hear that you're feeling much better. That was an unusually strong anticholinergic toxicity reaction that you had, especially from one dose of promethazine. Due to the strength of this drug, and the severity of the symptoms it treats, it is not recommended that it be given outside a hospital setting. Thanks @zzz for your comprehensive post with so much good information. My knee went out on me, and I wasn't able to do many of the things that were keeping me afloat, like walking, doing clay foot baths, taking plenty of charcoal, etc. Being so wary of benzos, I decided on the 1/4 tablet of Tylenol 4. But my dreams are still feeling very strange. I just ran across the following, which I think would be a VERY good thing for somebody to know who may be experiencing unexpected anticholinergic toxicity. I'm wondering whether I should consider this, given the end stage I find myself in. This is our best assessment at this time. Below is a link to a very good and comprehensive article on Antcholinergic Syndrome. It's fairly lengthy, and I only copied and pasted the \"Treatment\" section. I wish I had known about this treatment information 8 days ago when I awoke with all my severe symptoms, as the drug that antedotes AC Syndrome can work within minutes. Sorry your symptoms are still hanging on. Hope the new approach helps. I wrote the above about 5 days ago, and unfortunately, shortly afterwards I found myself heading back toward the precipice.

The official name is Neonatal Comfort Care Program and it’s a service of perinatal and neonatal palliative care, so our team takes care of babies before and after birth. As a neonatologist I am involved in the counseling of families expecting babies with severe conditions, including life-limiting conditions. As a neonatologist I like to give a plan of care to parents expecting a baby with problems, I can explain the medical care we will provide in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or which surgical procedure will solve the baby’s problems, but in these cases, what could I offer? Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. And I should be able to address desires and expectations of their families.” My first case was a little girl with Trisomy 18 who lived for two weeks. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. After her, I started following other mothers and other babies and the number of families I have been following has been greatly increasing over time. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Some babies were born in other institutions in U.S., or even internationally; for instance, I followed a family via Skype in Dubai, and a number of families in Italy. Definitely. These families need to learn how to communicate this not only with those outside the family, but even in the family: how to tell the other siblings without crushing their hearts, how to tell your own parents, or figuring out who you want to tell. There is a lot of emotional and psychological support needed, and this is more about what my team does. A baby needs to know only love and comfort. But even after they’re born, they will be held, they will be fed, they will be warm, and they won’t experience any pain. So, their life will be short but, for them, it will be a beautiful experience of love and welcoming.” Depending on the family’s background—religious, social, racial, etc.—we try to craft a plan that follows the medical and non-medical needs of each baby. In short, we do follow the babies along their natural life. When they come to us, they just say, “I wish I had met you before. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. Browne was fascinated by emeralds and spent extensive time in Colombia researching the book, which was published in 1978. In July 1978 David Niven Jr, who had just made Escape to Athena, arrived in Hollywood to commence pre production on the film adaptation.

Among the children for whom MCK provided financial assistance over the six months from January-June were 3 year old Nada and 10-year-old Siti Aisyah, both of whom are suffering from Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone or soft tissue cancer, and 15-year-old Rizki Rifalah, pictured with his mother, who has brain germinoma, a type of germ cell tumor. August will see the arrival of Jane Peski, a pediatric oncology nurse from The Academic Medical Centre (AMC), the most prominent medical centre in the Netherlands and one of its largest hospitals. She will be conducting two week basic and advanced training programs at Dharmais Hospital for nurses from across the country. The case of baby Farida offers an example of the positive impact that MCKs assistance can provide to babies in need of urgent medical care. Farida was born premature, at just 37 weeks and weighing only 1560 grams. Upon birth she was found to have Gastroschisis, or abdominal hernia, an abdominal wall defect in which the intestines develop outside the abdomen through an opening in the abdominal wall. She needed an immediate operation to push the intestines back into the abdomen and seal the opening, but with her father working as a driver and earning just Rp. Two weeks later Farida was stable enough to be moved out of the intensive care unit and within five weeks her parents were able to take her home. MCK is happy that so many of our supporters find time to visit the children in the wards we work with at Cipto and Dharmais. The photo below, shows Barbara and Heidi from Die Brucke along with six street children supported by Die Brucke who in turn, visit Cipto weekly to cuddle & feed babies in the ward. Through a cancer foundation in the Netherlands, the Queen Wilhelmina Fund, Professor Veerman has been providing assistance to children’s oncology wards in Yogyakarta, Semarang, Medan and Manado. Dr. Edi Tehuteru from Dharmais Hospital, who has known Professor Veerman for some time, also joined the dinner. For the past four years, MCK has organized an outing to Ragunan Zoo in Jakarta to coincide with the annual zoo run organized by Jakarta Free Spirit. This represents a rare opportunity for children receiving treatment at “Dharmais” hospital to enjoy a day out with their families and has always been a popular event. This year was no exception, with the number of families joining being the highest yet: together with volunteers the MCK group numbered 115 people! We were very sorry to have to say farewell to Astrid, an MCK volunteer for the past two years, who has recently returned to the Netherlands, but wish her and her family lots of luck and happiness in their new adventure. As the holiday season and year end approaches, Mary’s Cancer Kiddies (MCK) volunteers would like to say a special thank you to our generous supporters and to wish you and your families all the very best for 2009. Thanks to your help, we have been able to continue our work with children suffering from cancer and infectious diseases, and prematurely born babies. Working with children with cancer in any country is very grueling and in Indonesia, where children generally come in for treatment only after their cancer is well advanced and the prognosis is often consequently bleak, this is all the more true. Sometimes, though, the least hopeful cases can surprise even the most experienced cancer specialists, as the case of six-year-old Siskawati demonstrates. Fortunately, even though her chances of survival were very slim, Siskawati’s family went ahead with the recommended treatment, including the removal of her eye and, after several cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer cells in her brain died. Today, little Siskawati is doing well and she is in the process of being fitted with a prosthetic eye funded by MCK, thanks to two of our generous supporters. MCK has also provided financial assistance to dozens of other children at Dharmais hospital. They include 14-year-old Rico, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. One family whose son, Alfonsus, was diagnosed with cancer nearly did just that. At Cipto hospital many families face the same dilemma as those at Dharmais and MCK therefore works closely with the doctors and nurses to provide assistance to those most in need. Among the children who have received MCK support at Cipto hospital in recent months are 6-year-old Zaenab and 15-month-old Zaki, both suffering from Leukaemia, and 6-year-old Vina, who has a tumor on her retina. In recent months, MCK has provided support for hundreds of premature babies being treated in the neonatal ward at Cipto hospital. While MCK would not be able to do the work we do without the money generously provided by our donors, MCK is delighted that their kindness so often also extends to taking the time to visit the children and show their concern for them and their families. JIS students have continued to pay visits the children’s cancer ward at Dharmais to spend time with the children and, in April, two of them joined Dan Roberts of Clowns without Borders/ Hidung Merah Circus to entertain them. British Women’s Association (BWA) volunteers have been regular visitors to Cipto hospital. The photo below shows two of them, Chris and Penny, preparing to give out to those undergoing treatment school bags, books and pencils donated by BIS students. The Foundation matches each Rp. Don Hall, who runs the foundation set up in his daughter’s name, at the children’s cancer ward of Cipto, is pictured here\n\nQuestion: Who is the child of the cast member of Green Ice?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Among the children for whom MCK provided financial assistance over the six months from January-June were 3 year old Nada and 10-year-old Siti Aisyah, both of whom are suffering from Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone or soft tissue cancer, and 15-year-old Rizki Rifalah, pictured with his mother, who has brain germinoma, a type of germ cell tumor. August will see the arrival of Jane Peski, a pediatric oncology nurse from The Academic Medical Centre (AMC), the most prominent medical centre in the Netherlands and one of its largest hospitals. She will be conducting two week basic and advanced training programs at Dharmais Hospital for nurses from across the country. The case of baby Farida offers an example of the positive impact that MCKs assistance can provide to babies in need of urgent medical care. Farida was born premature, at just 37 weeks and weighing only 1560 grams. Upon birth she was found to have Gastroschisis, or abdominal hernia, an abdominal wall defect in which the intestines develop outside the abdomen through an opening in the abdominal wall. She needed an immediate operation to push the intestines back into the abdomen and seal the opening, but with her father working as a driver and earning just Rp. Two weeks later Farida was stable enough to be moved out of the intensive care unit and within five weeks her parents were able to take her home. MCK is happy that so many of our supporters find time to visit the children in the wards we work with at Cipto and Dharmais. The photo below, shows Barbara and Heidi from Die Brucke along with six street children supported by Die Brucke who in turn, visit Cipto weekly to cuddle & feed babies in the ward. Through a cancer foundation in the Netherlands, the Queen Wilhelmina Fund, Professor Veerman has been providing assistance to children’s oncology wards in Yogyakarta, Semarang, Medan and Manado. Dr. Edi Tehuteru from Dharmais Hospital, who has known Professor Veerman for some time, also joined the dinner. For the past four years, MCK has organized an outing to Ragunan Zoo in Jakarta to coincide with the annual zoo run organized by Jakarta Free Spirit. This represents a rare opportunity for children receiving treatment at “Dharmais” hospital to enjoy a day out with their families and has always been a popular event. This year was no exception, with the number of families joining being the highest yet: together with volunteers the MCK group numbered 115 people! We were very sorry to have to say farewell to Astrid, an MCK volunteer for the past two years, who has recently returned to the Netherlands, but wish her and her family lots of luck and happiness in their new adventure. As the holiday season and year end approaches, Mary’s Cancer Kiddies (MCK) volunteers would like to say a special thank you to our generous supporters and to wish you and your families all the very best for 2009. Thanks to your help, we have been able to continue our work with children suffering from cancer and infectious diseases, and prematurely born babies. Working with children with cancer in any country is very grueling and in Indonesia, where children generally come in for treatment only after their cancer is well advanced and the prognosis is often consequently bleak, this is all the more true. Sometimes, though, the least hopeful cases can surprise even the most experienced cancer specialists, as the case of six-year-old Siskawati demonstrates. Fortunately, even though her chances of survival were very slim, Siskawati’s family went ahead with the recommended treatment, including the removal of her eye and, after several cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer cells in her brain died. Today, little Siskawati is doing well and she is in the process of being fitted with a prosthetic eye funded by MCK, thanks to two of our generous supporters. MCK has also provided financial assistance to dozens of other children at Dharmais hospital. They include 14-year-old Rico, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. One family whose son, Alfonsus, was diagnosed with cancer nearly did just that. At Cipto hospital many families face the same dilemma as those at Dharmais and MCK therefore works closely with the doctors and nurses to provide assistance to those most in need. Among the children who have received MCK support at Cipto hospital in recent months are 6-year-old Zaenab and 15-month-old Zaki, both suffering from Leukaemia, and 6-year-old Vina, who has a tumor on her retina. In recent months, MCK has provided support for hundreds of premature babies being treated in the neonatal ward at Cipto hospital. While MCK would not be able to do the work we do without the money generously provided by our donors, MCK is delighted that their kindness so often also extends to taking the time to visit the children and show their concern for them and their families. JIS students have continued to pay visits the children’s cancer ward at Dharmais to spend time with the children and, in April, two of them joined Dan Roberts of Clowns without Borders/ Hidung Merah Circus to entertain them. British Women’s Association (BWA) volunteers have been regular visitors to Cipto hospital. The photo below shows two of them, Chris and Penny, preparing to give out to those undergoing treatment school bags, books and pencils donated by BIS students. The Foundation matches each Rp. Don Hall, who runs the foundation set up in his daughter’s name, at the children’s cancer ward of Cipto, is pictured here\n\n"

Student activists from the university stirred up the masses of youth and the working class to conduct protest actions, from the March 1961 demonstration of 5,000 UP student demonstrators that scuttled the anti-communist witch-hunt of the Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities (CAFA) to the 1970 First Quarter Storm that rocked the National Capital Region with almost weekly marches and rallies of 50,000 to 100,000 people campaigning against the administration. As rinderpest ravaged the country at the turn of the century, the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines decided to establish a College of Veterinary Science. The College was founded on 18 June 1908 through Republic Act No. With Dr. Archibald Ward as the first dean, the College held its first classes on 4 June 1910 with four students at the Animal Quarantine Station, Pandacan, Manila. The college has been relocated to five different places: San Lazaro, Manila (1912–1919); Los Baños, Laguna (1919–1933); back to Pandacan, Manila (1933–1949); Diliman, Quezon City (1949–1983) and finally to Los Baños, Laguna in 1983.

Coal was inexpensive, and Ontario lacked sufficient alternatives such as hydroelectric power or natural gas. By the late 1990s, however, links between adverse health effects and air pollution were firmly established, and much of this could be traced to Ontario’s coal-powered plants. Ontario’s first electrical power supply came from a hydroelectric generating station on the Ottawa River in 1892. Hydro expanded rapidly across the province in the early 20th century. So, in the 1950s, Ontario added six coal-fired power stations to meet rising demand. Coal remained an important part of this mix until the end of the 20th century, when it made up about a quarter of electricity generation in the province. By that time, the health risks of coal were becoming increasingly apparent. As burners of carbon-based fossil fuels, Ontario’s coal-fired power plants were heavy emitters of greenhouse gases, which threaten to accelerate climate change. Burning coal also releases nitrogen oxide, which contributes ground-level ozone, a principal factor in smog, which has a devastating effect on public health. The province attributed 1,800 premature deaths and 1,400 cardiac and respiratory hospital admissions each year to smog. Several studies and reports had also highlighted the connection between Ontario’s air quality and public health. A 2005 report by the Ontario Ministry of Energy concluded that coal contributed to 928 hospital admissions and 1,100 emergency-room visits each year. Pressure was building to improve air quality. In 1999, the Ontario Public Health Association called on the province to replace its coal-fired power plants with cleaner power sources. Its central goal was to replace toxic coal with cleaner power. Ontario closed four coal-fired plants in 2010, and the last one in 2014 – making Ontario the first jurisdiction in North America to shut down coal-fired generation. Even with the conservation measures set out in the plan, Ontario would have to supply electricity to make up for the closures of the coal-fired plants. Hydro was not an option, as Ontario had reached nearly 75% of its hydro capacity. Since 2003, investment in Ontario’s power infrastructure has modernized three reactors (Pickering A Unit 1 and Bruce Units 3 and 4) and returned them to service. Any change in the power mix has environmental consequences – which leads Ontarians to ask whether the transition from coal to nuclear power might simply involve changing types of air pollution. To answer this question, it is important to look at a power plant’s emissions from cradle to grave – including its construction, its fuel source, its waste products, and its eventual shutdown and decommissioning. According to the provincial government, “Ontario’s air quality has improved steadily since 1988. We have good air quality approximately 90 per cent of the time.” With the exception of a spike in 2012, which included a serious drought, the number and duration of smog advisories across the province has dropped steadily since 2003. Even with this progress, there is still much room for improvement – especially as Ontario’s population ages and more people are at higher risk of health effects from air pollution. Recognizing this value, the province also put primary focus on nuclear energy in its 2013 Long-Term Energy Plan. The following infographic shows the rationale for using nuclear energy in Ontario.

Mission: 1) To advance initiatives in the new field of Narrative Medicine and 2) To contribute to the development of Narrative Medicine graduates as leaders, teachers, and scholars and to create a strong corps of alumnae/alumni with close professional connections to the Program in Narrative Medicine and Columbia University. Mid-Year and Final Reports: All fellows will be required to submit a mid-year written report, due on February 1, 2018, and a final written report and/or presentation, due by August 31, 2018. Each fellow will be assigned a faculty mentor from the Master’s program in Narrative Medicine.

We are medical students who completed the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program between our third and fourth year of training during the 2015-2016 academic year. As the Narrative Medicine Master’s Program enters its seventh year, the first alumni classes to complete medical school are now entering residency training programs. This is an opportune moment to examine the impact of the Master’s Program on the medical education experiences of alumni and, through their work, on their peers and faculty. We propose to interview Narrative Medicine alumni who are currently in or have recently completed their medical education to learn how they have used their narrative medicine training in their medical schools. Forty-seven alumni of the Master’s program were either medical students when they enrolled in the MS or applied to medical school upon completion of the degree. We plan to invite these alumni to be interviewed by one of us about their experiences in medical school. I propose to evaluate Narrative Medicine workshops at Columbia University Medical Center’s (CUMC) Lang Youth Program in order to explore the impact of narrative methods training for teens/youth, who are in a competitive and specialized pre-health professional track, in developing empathy, self-reflection/awareness, skills of close reading, and attentive listening. We strive to share innovative methods of self-care in graduate medical education through the practice of Narrative Medicine, a fluid, diverse, and potentially powerful medium of personal reflection and coping. We hope to illuminate how art and literature can bring about a different, expansive way of thinking that allows one to listen to one’s own mind and to others.

Mission: 1) To advance initiatives in the new field of Narrative Medicine and 2) To contribute to the development of Narrative Medicine graduates as leaders, teachers, and scholars and to create a strong corps of alumnae/alumni with close professional connections to the Program in Narrative Medicine and Columbia University. Mid-Year and Final Reports: All fellows will be required to submit a mid-year written report, due on February 1, 2018, and a final written report and/or presentation, due by August 31, 2018. Each fellow will be assigned a faculty mentor from the Master’s program in Narrative Medicine.

This Land is a proposed oral history project based on Alexander’s ongoing ancestral and embodied research. The foundation of his work rests on artists and social justice pioneers like James Baldwin and Maya Angelou, among many others. He also draws inspiration from his own ancestors, German Jews who were traders, bankers, communists, painters, writers, feminists, and survivors, and English, Irish Catholics who fled the potato famine, and other Germans who settled on Indian land in the Midwest. We are medical students who completed the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program between our third and fourth year of training during the 2015-2016 academic year. As the Narrative Medicine Master’s Program enters its seventh year, the first alumni classes to complete medical school are now entering residency training programs. This is an opportune moment to examine the impact of the Master’s Program on the medical education experiences of alumni and, through their work, on their peers and faculty. We propose to interview Narrative Medicine alumni who are currently in or have recently completed their medical education to learn how they have used their narrative medicine training in their medical schools. Forty-seven alumni of the Master’s program were either medical students when they enrolled in the MS or applied to medical school upon completion of the degree. We plan to invite these alumni to be interviewed by one of us about their experiences in medical school. I propose to evaluate Narrative Medicine workshops at Columbia University Medical Center’s (CUMC) Lang Youth Program in order to explore the impact of narrative methods training for teens/youth, who are in a competitive and specialized pre-health professional track, in developing empathy, self-reflection/awareness, skills of close reading, and attentive listening. We strive to share innovative methods of self-care in graduate medical education through the practice of Narrative Medicine, a fluid, diverse, and potentially powerful medium of personal reflection and coping. We hope to illuminate how art and literature can bring about a different, expansive way of thinking that allows one to listen to one’s own mind and to others. The aim of this Fellowship is to research, curate and construct a comprehensive pedagogy and companion 12-week syllabus for the purpose of instructing students in the graduate program in Narrative Medicine at the School of Professional Studies, Columbia University.

The movie averaged 2.5 million viewers in its debut on October 18, 2008. A red carpet premiere evening screening took place in New York on September 24, 2008, with a reception following with Harry Connick, Jr. and Bernadette Peters performing.

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. On the new episode of ‘Documenting Popular Music,’ journalist Robert Neil speaks with Platts and Lee from their studio in London about the new album and the retro sound that is starting to get a good deal of attention. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. The O&F Studios is currently working on an elaborate edition of Documenting Popular Music, which will take a look at the year in music from 1977 and the music and trends that helped shape the latter half of the 70s. Additional episodes currently being produced include an interview with the author of a new biography about\n\n Gentry's sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling the Washington Post that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it. Gentry also brought \"Mississippi Delta\" to Capitol on the same demo tape and it was this recording, rather than \"Ode to Billie Joe\", that initially got her signed. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial and reflects what was on the charts in 1967. Gentry most likely recorded the song at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California. Gentry was officially signed to Capitol Records on June 23, 1967. It was the day after the string session that Capitol's A&R team decided definitively that \"Ode to Billie Joe\" would be the A-side. She recorded an album, Reach, for Mercury Records Nashville in 2001. At the age of five, she was a member of the traveling choir the Mississippi Show Stoppers, along with Lance Bass of *NSYNC. Lance had signed Meredith to his own management called Free Lance Entertainment. In 2001, she released her first CD, Reach, under the Mercury label. Two other number ones — \"Blood Red and Goin' Down\" and \"Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)\" followed, establishing Tucker as a major star. In 1975, she signed with MCA Records, where she had a string of hit singles that ran into the late 1970s.

The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company.

The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed Popular sovereipopular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery, but Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska \n\n narrowly passed Congress in May 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency. Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other \n\n  The 1856 Republican National Convention was a presidential nominating convention that met from June 17 to June 19 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Republican Party had been organized by opponents of the expansion of slavery in the territories following the passage of the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.\" The Democratic Party had a small yet decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery. In 1854, angry with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, anti-slavery Democrats left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the Republican Party.\n\n"

A critical focus of Blumenthal's work has been defeating breast cancer. Her work focused on advancing global health, addressing health disparities, improving mental health, preventing violence and suicide, and emphasizing the importance of disease prevention. She was among the first in the government to address this disease's impact on women. Blumenthal was a pioneer in applying information technology to improve health, establishing some of the first health internet sites in the government. Health education and mentoring of students has also been a focus of her work. She has served as the Elizabeth Blackwell Lecturer and Bundy Visiting Professor at the Mayo Clinic, the Lila Wallis Distinguished Professor of Women's Health at Weill Cornell Medical College, as a visiting professor at Stanford University in Washington, as distinguished visiting professor of women's studies at Brandeis University, and as a visiting fellow at the Harvard University School of Government. Prior to these positions, Blumenthal was head of the Suicide Research Unit and coordinator of Project Depression, the first major public awareness campaign on this disease at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). She served as a national spokesperson, increased scientific and public attention, and stimulated research and prevention efforts to address these public health problems. In 1985, Blumenthal was appointed as the chief of the Basic Prevention and Behavioral Medicine Research Branch at NIMH. During her tenure at NIH, she worked with other colleagues and advocates to expose the inequities in women's health research and the lack of focus on sex differences in disease. Later career \nCurrently, Blumenthal is public health editor at HuffPost, the senior policy and medical advisor at AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, and a clinical professor at Tufts Medical Center and the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Additionally, Blumenthal serves on the board of directors of several philanthropic and educational organizations and is an advisory council member of the MIT Media Lab.

Sanjay Basu, MD, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Stanford University. He is a primary care physician and an epidemiologist with a focus on conducting operations research to improve programs designed to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among low-income populations. Dr. Basu received his undergraduate education at MIT, and a master's degree in medical anthropology through a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford before completing his MD and PhD in epidemiology at Yale. His work also involves the development of novel methods to address causal inference problems when evaluating social programs that offer few opportunities for randomization and significant risks of selection bias. He previously worked at Partners in Health and Oxfam GB, then co-founded the organization Possible Health (formerly Nyaya Health). He currently serves on expert advisory panels for the United Nations, World Health Organization, World Heart Federation, the American Heart Association, and the Global Burden of Disease Project, among other roles. He was selected as one of the “Top 100 Global Thinkers” by Foreign Policy magazine in 2013 for his co-authorship of the book The Body Economic with David Stuckler of Oxford University. He has also received both the Weingarten Award in Medicine (2012) and the Rosenkranz Prize in Healthcare Research (2013). He has published over 300 scientific publications on the epidemiology of malnutrition, the double burden of malnutrition (undernutrition and obesity), the short and long-term effects of undernutrition during early childhood, the nutritional status and dietary intake of the Mexican population and the evaluation of programs and policies to improve the nutritional status of populations. He has been advisor to the Government on the design of obesity prevention strategies and is currently evaluating a number of those policies. He was honored with the 2010 Elsevier Scopus Award in Health Sciences (México) and the Kellogg International Nutrition Prize 2009 by the American Society for Nutrition.

She has served as the Elizabeth Blackwell Lecturer and Bundy Visiting Professor at the Mayo Clinic, the Lila Wallis Distinguished Professor of Women's Health at Weill Cornell Medical College, as a visiting professor at Stanford University in Washington, as distinguished visiting professor of women's studies at Brandeis University, and as a visiting fellow at the Harvard University School of Government. Prior to these positions, Blumenthal was head of the Suicide Research Unit and coordinator of Project Depression, the first major public awareness campaign on this disease at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). She served as a national spokesperson, increased scientific and public attention, and stimulated research and prevention efforts to address these public health problems. In 1985, Blumenthal was appointed as the chief of the Basic Prevention and Behavioral Medicine Research Branch at NIMH. During her tenure at NIH, she worked with other colleagues and advocates to expose the inequities in women's health research and the lack of focus on sex differences in disease. Later career \nCurrently, Blumenthal is public health editor at HuffPost, the senior policy and medical advisor at AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, and a clinical professor at Tufts Medical Center and the Georgetown University School of Medicine.

Blumenthal has served as the commencement speaker and received honorary degrees and doctorates from universities in the United States and around the world in recognition of her contributions to improving national and global health, and for “her innovative work in identifying and championing understudied public health problems, and marshaling the resources of the government to address them.\" References\n\n1952 births\nLiving people\nAmerican public health doctors\nUniversity of Tennessee alumni\nAmerican psychiatrists\nUnited States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps admirals\nHarvard Kennedy School alumni\nStanford Medical School alumni\nSpouses of Massachusetts politicians\nRecipients of the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal\n\n• Methods for building an evidence base – What is new in nutrition policy research? Sanjay Basu, MD, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Stanford University. He is a primary care physician and an epidemiologist with a focus on conducting operations research to improve programs designed to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among low-income populations. Dr. Basu received his undergraduate education at MIT, and a master's degree in medical anthropology through a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford before completing his MD and PhD in epidemiology at Yale. His work also involves the development of novel methods to address causal inference problems when evaluating social programs that offer few opportunities for randomization and significant risks of selection bias. He previously worked at Partners in Health and Oxfam GB, then co-founded the organization Possible Health (formerly Nyaya Health). He currently serves on expert advisory panels for the United Nations, World Health Organization, World Heart Federation, the American Heart Association, and the Global Burden of Disease Project, among other roles. He was selected as one of the “Top 100 Global Thinkers” by Foreign Policy magazine in 2013 for his co-authorship of the book The Body Economic with David Stuckler of Oxford University. He has also received both the Weingarten Award in Medicine (2012) and the Rosenkranz Prize in Healthcare Research (2013). He has published over 300 scientific publications on the epidemiology of malnutrition, the double burden of malnutrition (undernutrition and obesity), the short and long-term effects of undernutrition during early childhood, the nutritional status and dietary intake of the Mexican population and the evaluation of programs and policies to improve the nutritional status of populations. He has been advisor to the Government on the design of obesity prevention strategies and is currently evaluating a number of those policies. He was honored with the 2010 Elsevier Scopus Award in Health Sciences (México) and the Kellogg International Nutrition Prize 2009 by the American Society for Nutrition. Her efforts to promote improved health and quality of life for all levels of society have been acknowledged by her peers in healthcare and in the business world. In addition, as a consultant to Fleishman-Hillard International Communications, she interprets and assesses the implications of nutrition research and helps communicate those findings to industry, consumers and the media. This work ranges from comparative effectiveness studies of bariatric surgical procedures, to trials of novel behavioral interventions for diet, to studies of policy interventions for improving diet at the population-level. She is a decision scientist and epidemiologist who uses mathematical models to inform policy. She is interested in the distribution of modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and preventive screening, and how they reduce disease risk across the population and in subgroups. Her work examined how various strategies and policies may help fight obesity in children and adolescents, and whether they are cost-effective. One of her research areas is the role of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by children and adults and the health and economic impacts of levying excise taxes on these beverages. Julie joined the Sackler Institute at the New York Academy of Sciences in 2014 as Program Manager after a postdoctoral fellowship at the New York Obesity Research Center where she examined postprandial energy expenditure. She brings experience from industry and the laboratory to her position at the Academy, having worked in research and development at DuPont after her undergraduate education in molecular biology. This Division works to advance population health by improving access to high-quality health services and health insurance and introducing innovative system changes that promote disease prevention and control.

Appetite for stronger economic co-operation grew due to the recession and the potential failure of some weaker eurozone members. However, Germany had opposed previous moves to strengthen the Eurogroup, such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempts at Eurogroup summits, due to fears of undermining the ECB's independence. Jean-Claude Trichet, who succeeded Duisenberg as ECB president in 2003, fended off numerous attacks from Sarkozy at the start of the recession. Before that formalisation of the Eurogroup, eurozone leaders held an extraordinary summit in reaction to the financial crisis on 11 October 2008 in Paris.

Its aim is to ensure stability in the euro zone and spare taxpayers and the real economy of the eventual risk of a bank's bankruptcy. Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB.

Appetite for stronger economic co-operation grew due to the recession and the potential failure of some weaker eurozone members. However, Germany had opposed previous moves to strengthen the Eurogroup, such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempts at Eurogroup summits, due to fears of undermining the ECB's independence. Jean-Claude Trichet, who succeeded Duisenberg as ECB president in 2003, fended off numerous attacks from Sarkozy at the start of the recession. Before that formalisation of the Eurogroup, eurozone leaders held an extraordinary summit in reaction to the financial crisis on 11 October 2008 in Paris. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the President of the ECB, who is appointed by the European Council, the vice-president of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states. Its aim is to ensure stability in the euro zone and spare taxpayers and the real economy of the eventual risk of a bank's bankruptcy. Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB. It is composed of the President of the Bank (currently Christine Lagarde), the vice-president (currently Luis de Guindos) and four other members.

Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences.

As an adult, Dunn stood 3' 10\" and weighed about 78 pounds (117 cm, 35 kg). Early life Dunn was born to Jewell (née Hilly; died 1990) and Fred Miller (died 1981) during the time of the Dust Bowl drought. He chose his stage name in order to differentiate himself from another Gary Miller in the Screen Actors Guild. However, according to his Columbia Studios press kit biography, his studies were interrupted when he was knocked down a flight of stairs during a \"student rush\", which resulted in a three-month hospital stay. His classmate John Softness recalled, \"He could sing like an angel, and he could act and he could write and he was a brilliant raconteur.\" At various points, he held different odd jobs—singing in a nightclub, answering telephones for the Miami Daily News, and working as a hotel detective. He was living in Ann Arbor with his parents, working as a professional singer, at the time he entered St. Bonaventure Monastery in Detroit, on February 25, 1958. Dunn was later quoted in the New York Post explaining that he had wanted to be of service, since he was unfit for the military: \"Everyone my age was going to Korea and I had this feeling that singing wasn't exactly doing my part.\" Dunn left of his own accord on May 8, 1958, in order to pursue a stage career in New York. He also befriended actress Phoebe Dorin in an off-Broadway show, Two by Saroyan, in which both had small parts in the early 1960s. Eventually, on the advice of fellow actor Roddy McDowall, the pair started a nightclub act of songs mixed with conversational patter, titled \"Michael Dunn and Phoebe\". The act received favorable reviews in Time magazine and The New York Times and ultimately led directly to the pair being cast on The Wild Wild West television series, a Western spy spoof with elements of historical fiction and science fiction, which debuted in 1965. Dunn was probably best known for his recurring role on that series as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a mad scientist who devised passionately perverse schemes and gadgetry to ensnare Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin). Dorin played Dr. Loveless's devoted assistant, Antoinette. According to Dorin, Dunn saved her from drowning during filming of the episode \"The Night of the Murderous Spring\", plunging underwater to tear her free, when her costume became entangled in machinery used to sink a boat on the set. Dunn appeared as Dr Loveless 10 times on The Wild Wild West (four times apiece in the first two seasons and one time apiece in the remaining two seasons). In the pilot episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry television spy spoof Get Smart, Dunn showed his skill with comic farce as the well-heeled gangster Mr. Big, leader of international crime organization K.A.O.S. Dunn featured as Alexander, a courageous court jester, in the Star Trek episode \"Plato's Stepchildren\" (November 22, 1968). He also appeared in an episode of Bonanza, \"It's a Small World\" (January 4, 1970), portraying a recently widowed circus performer trying to start a new life, and as a killer clown in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \"The Wax Men\" (5 March 1967).

We were given three options. The first was a termination, the second an amniocentesis to check for genetic conditions and the third to carry on and do nothing. There we saw a specialist who explained the likely cause of baby not growing and the lack of amniotic fluid was placenta insufficiency. It was explained to us that there was a high risk baby would not survive through the pregnancy and if he did there were many risks of complications. We were again offered a termination but we just weren’t ready to give up on our baby. At this stage we were offered the chance to take place in a study called STRIDOR which was being carried out by Tommy’s. We agreed to take part as any chance there was to help our baby survive was worth it. Later that evening when I was well enough to go and see him I was in awe of how tiny yet perfect our little boy was. As we sat by James’ incubator we got to see his little personality and create some beautiful memories. I longed to hold him but he was far to poorly, however the nurses looking after James were fantastic. They taught us how to do James’s cares and change his tiny nappy and included us whenever possible in looking after him. Sadly 2 days later on the 12th July at seven days old James could no longer fight and we had to say goodbye. Losing James has been so hard and I have suffered with PTSD, anxiety and depression since, however we are very grateful for the chances we were given by Tommy’s and by the team looking after us at St Mary’s hospital without there dedication and care it is likely we would never have got to meet our beautiful little boy at all. It has been tough and at times we have talked about giving up on our dream of having a child to love and nurture and see them develop into a wonderful person with goals and aspirations and a heart full of love and kindness.

The first was a termination, the second an amniocentesis to check for genetic conditions and the third to carry on and do nothing. There we saw a specialist who explained the likely cause of baby not growing and the lack of amniotic fluid was placenta insufficiency. It was explained to us that there was a high risk baby would not survive through the pregnancy and if he did there were many risks of complications. We were again offered a termination but we just weren’t ready to give up on our baby. At this stage we were offered the chance to take place in a study called STRIDOR which was being carried out by Tommy’s. We agreed to take part as any chance there was to help our baby survive was worth it. Later that evening when I was well enough to go and see him I was in awe of how tiny yet perfect our little boy was. As we sat by James’ incubator we got to see his little personality and create some beautiful memories. I longed to hold him but he was far to poorly, however the nurses looking after James were fantastic. They taught us how to do James’s cares and change his tiny nappy and included us whenever possible in looking after him. Sadly 2 days later on the 12th July at seven days old James could no longer fight and we had to say goodbye. Losing James has been so hard and I have suffered with PTSD, anxiety and depression since, however we are very grateful for the chances we were given by Tommy’s and by the team looking after us at St Mary’s hospital without there dedication and care it is likely we would never have got to meet our beautiful little boy at all. It has been tough and at times we have talked about giving up on our dream of having a child to love and nurture and see them develop into a wonderful person with goals and aspirations and a heart full of love and kindness.

Using a longitudinal qualitative study, we explored the experiences, opportunities, challenges as well as recommendations of Community Health Workers (CHWs) after participation in annual mass drug administration (MDA) activities for schistosomiasis using the CDI approach in an urban setting. Narratives were obtained from CHWs using a digital audio recorder during the group discussions, transcribed verbatim and translated into English where applicable. From the perspective of the CHWs, opportunities for implementing CDI in urban settings, included the presence of CHWs, their supervisory structures and their knowledge of intervention areas, and opportunity to integrate MDA with other health interventions. The success in achieving reduction in disease burden lies in ensuring that available health interventions reach those who are at risk. One proven strategy in addressing the problem of access to health interventions is the Community Directed Intervention (CDI), which is based on the principle of active structural community participation to prioritize and address their own health challenges . The Community Directed Treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) used for mass distribution of ivermectin in rural African populations for the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis [7–10] using community drug distributors (CDD) are good examples of programs that have successfully employed the CDI strategy. To improve access to treatment at affordable and sustainable costs and, where possible, to improve existing programmes, the CDI strategy has been presented as a viable alternative for control of schistosomiasis and STHs, and has been implemented in several settings including Kenya , Tanzania [12, 13], Mali and Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda , where CDDs and Community health workers (CHWs) also played a key role in treatment. Although the CDI strategy has been piloted in Kenya and community wide treatment for schistosomiasis has been established by several partners in Kenya and other areas, these programs are mainly rural-based leaving out the urban areas where schistosomiasis thrives as well. Whereas majority of studies have been conducted in rural areas, it is noteworthy that there is limited data on the effectiveness of the CDI strategy in more challenging settings like urban informal settlements where the traditional community structure is non-existent. The clear socio-economic differences between rural and urban communities, and the need to investigate experiences of CHWs conducting MDA in urban areas has been indicated before . In this longitudinal qualitative study, we explored the experiences, opportunities, challenges as well as recommendations of CHWs after participation in annual MDA activities for schistosomiasis using the CDI strategy in an informal settlement in Kisumu City, western Kenya. The study was conducted in a sub-location (presented here as Area X to protect identity), an informal settlement in Kisumu City, western Kenya. The sub-location covers an area of 6.1 Km2 with a total population of 32,430 people, 16,189 of whom are male and 16,241 female . There are five health units which are further sub-divided into nine sub-units, headed by one or two village elders depending on their size. The main economic activities in the area include fishing, car washing and small business enterprises. The main religion is christianity. Intestinal schistosomiasis is a public health problem in the area and its prevalence of 36 % is highest compared to all the other informal settlements in the City . Poor sanitation prevails with high use of bush (open defecation) or ‘flying’ toilets (use of plastic bags for open defecation, which are then thrown into ditches, on the roadside, or simply as far away as possible). The lake is the main source of water for domestic use, but tap water, springs, boreholes, water vendors are also available. Before the study commencement, the study team visited the sub-location and held a stakeholder meeting to find out which were the major health problems in the sub-location. Since schistosomiasis was the focus of the present study, ways to control it were explored and mass treatment was suggested to be most cost effective intervention to be implemented, though health education, water and sanitation as well as mollusciding were also discussed. Summaries of the study protocol were shared with different stakeholders including Ministry of Health officials, religious leaders, local politicians and administrators who were all sensitized on the benefits of the programme. Advocacy meetings were held at municipal headquarters targeting senior health officials. These officials helped in training drug distributors and later offered indirect supervision during the MDAs. The programme embarked on different mobilization strategies to ensure uptake of the programme. First the local administration was used to sensitize the community through barazas (community gatherings), and through announcements at funeral ceremonies. Letters were written to religious leaders to inform their congregations about the programme and request for their participation. In addition, the programme conducted radio campaigns and road shows. The message was packaged in the three languages that the residents understood, dholuo, Kiswahili and English. Door to door campaigns were also conducted during the MDA. Training manuals were adopted from Ministry of health’s National school-based deworming program teacher training manual. These were edited by the programme officials to incorporate the programme’s needs and to make them suitable for CHWs. The training focused on schistosomiasis, praziqauntel (PZQ) distribution-related activities including community mobilisation, household enumeration, guidelines on the period and the duration of treatment, guidelines on the exclusion criteria, correct drug dosage using height, recognition and management of minor side effects, when to refer adverse reactions, basic record keeping, how to identify and report issues encountered during the distribution and how to report treatment coverage. CHWs were provided with treatment booklets, bags, T-shirts, respective dose poles and the drugs for distribution during the exercise. T-shirts served to identify the CHWs and as incentives to them, and bore deworming messages that aided in community sensitization.

When my father came back from the war, the money that his father had left for him to go university had gone, so he had to work his way through dental school. But he said to the four of us, 'It doesn't matter whether I leave you money or not; if I leave you with an education I will have left you with something.' He was determined that we should go to university, which we all did. Were there influences on you as a girl in the 1930s because of the sad division in South African society? The division was there, and quite unacceptable, but the actual word apartheid only came in at the end of the '40s. You have told me you didn't have private education. I went to the government school, quite close by, and then on to the local high school. It was only when I went to university that I suddenly discovered that I had some ability and used my brain. Was that partly because South Africa is such a beautiful country? I don't think if you lived in Johannesburg you'd ever want to live anywhere else, because it's a perfect climate, the best in the world. Moving later to Melbourne was definitely downwards, climate-wise. I liked going off completely on my own, climbing the mountains and going up the streams. When we went camping at Rustenburg Kloof, near Johannesburg, I used to disappear all day up the river in a pair of khaki shorts, with a few biscuits in my pocket and a swimming costume. Having reached the university opportunity that your father had always intended you to have, did you head straight for medical studies? I thought, 'Well, if I have to go to university, I'd better do some sport there.' That medical science course at Witwatersrand University, in Johannesburg, included things like histology and physiology but didn't quite get clinical. How did you move to studying medicine itself? Did you have any influential tutors at university? There was a very interesting and inspirational tutor, Joe Gillman, who went subsequently to Ghana. He was inspiring because he was so committed to what he did. He was also very left-wing and he probably influenced me in that direction. In my university career I was very much on the left wing of things, which of course wasn't popular at all in South Africa in those days. What did the war mean to you?

        "context": "The Community Directed Intervention (CDI) strategy has been used to conduct various health interventions in Africa, including control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Using a longitudinal qualitative study, we explored the experiences, opportunities, challenges as well as recommendations of Community Health Workers (CHWs) after participation in annual mass drug administration (MDA) activities for schistosomiasis using the CDI approach in an urban setting. Narratives were obtained from CHWs using a digital audio recorder during the group discussions, transcribed verbatim and translated into English where applicable. From the perspective of the CHWs, opportunities for implementing CDI in urban settings, included the presence of CHWs, their supervisory structures and their knowledge of intervention areas, and opportunity to integrate MDA with other health interventions. The success in achieving reduction in disease burden lies in ensuring that available health interventions reach those who are at risk. One proven strategy in addressing the problem of access to health interventions is the Community Directed Intervention (CDI), which is based on the principle of active structural community participation to prioritize and address their own health challenges . The Community Directed Treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) used for mass distribution of ivermectin in rural African populations for the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis [7–10] using community drug distributors (CDD) are good examples of programs that have successfully employed the CDI strategy. To improve access to treatment at affordable and sustainable costs and, where possible, to improve existing programmes, the CDI strategy has been presented as a viable alternative for control of schistosomiasis and STHs, and has been implemented in several settings including Kenya , Tanzania [12, 13], Mali and Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda , where CDDs and Community health workers (CHWs) also played a key role in treatment. Although the CDI strategy has been piloted in Kenya and community wide treatment for schistosomiasis has been established by several partners in Kenya and other areas, these programs are mainly rural-based leaving out the urban areas where schistosomiasis thrives as well. Whereas majority of studies have been conducted in rural areas, it is noteworthy that there is limited data on the effectiveness of the CDI strategy in more challenging settings like urban informal settlements where the traditional community structure is non-existent. The clear socio-economic differences between rural and urban communities, and the need to investigate experiences of CHWs conducting MDA in urban areas has been indicated before . In this longitudinal qualitative study, we explored the experiences, opportunities, challenges as well as recommendations of CHWs after participation in annual MDA activities for schistosomiasis using the CDI strategy in an informal settlement in Kisumu City, western Kenya. The study was conducted in a sub-location (presented here as Area X to protect identity), an informal settlement in Kisumu City, western Kenya. The sub-location covers an area of 6.1 Km2 with a total population of 32,430 people, 16,189 of whom are male and 16,241 female . There are five health units which are further sub-divided into nine sub-units, headed by one or two village elders depending on their size. The main economic activities in the area include fishing, car washing and small business enterprises. The main religion is christianity. Intestinal schistosomiasis is a public health problem in the area and its prevalence of 36 % is highest compared to all the other informal settlements in the City . Poor sanitation prevails with high use of bush (open defecation) or ‘flying’ toilets (use of plastic bags for open defecation, which are then thrown into ditches, on the roadside, or simply as far away as possible). The lake is the main source of water for domestic use, but tap water, springs, boreholes, water vendors are also available. Before the study commencement, the study team visited the sub-location and held a stakeholder meeting to find out which were the major health problems in the sub-location. Since schistosomiasis was the focus of the present study, ways to control it were explored and mass treatment was suggested to be most cost effective intervention to be implemented, though health education, water and sanitation as well as mollusciding were also discussed. Summaries of the study protocol were shared with different stakeholders including Ministry of Health officials, religious leaders, local politicians and administrators who were all sensitized on the benefits of the programme. Advocacy meetings were held at municipal headquarters targeting senior health officials. These officials helped in training drug distributors and later offered indirect supervision during the MDAs. The programme embarked on different mobilization strategies to ensure uptake of the programme. First the local administration was used to sensitize the community through barazas (community gatherings), and through announcements at funeral ceremonies. Letters were written to religious leaders to inform their congregations about the programme and request for their participation. In addition, the programme conducted radio campaigns and road shows. The message was packaged in the three languages that the residents understood, dholuo, Kiswahili and English. Door to door campaigns were also conducted during the MDA. Training manuals were adopted from Ministry of health’s National school-based deworming program teacher training manual. These were edited by the programme officials to incorporate the programme’s needs and to make them suitable for CHWs. The training focused on schistosomiasis, praziqauntel (PZQ) distribution-related activities including community mobilisation, household enumeration, guidelines on the period and the duration of treatment, guidelines on the exclusion criteria, correct drug dosage using height, recognition and management of minor side effects, when to refer adverse reactions, basic record keeping, how to identify and report issues encountered during the distribution and how to report treatment coverage. CHWs were provided with treatment booklets, bags, T-shirts, respective dose poles and the drugs for distribution during the exercise. T-shirts served to identify the CHWs and as incentives to them, and bore deworming messages that aided in community sensitization. This field will grow rapidly in the future because it will become apparent that FLCN and BHD is just the beginning of the story.

The quick reaction was possible because of the active intervention of Encarnación Ezcurra, wife of Rosas.

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011. It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system. It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. The law is another milestone in food safety—the latest step to supplement hazard analysis and critical control point programs that have been mandated for a variety of commodities. What is so historic about the FSMA is that it involves creation of a new food safety system and implements a broad prevention mandate and accountability, plus a new system of import oversight. Some authorizations, such as the FDA’s new authority to order companies to recall food, will go into effect quickly. The FDA, however, is committed to implementing the requirements through an open, transparent process with opportunity for input from all stakeholders. The FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships. For the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply. This involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise. The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points. The FDA must establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards and those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally during processing. Therefore, the FDA must provide oversight, ensure compliance with requirements and respond effectively when problems emerge. Mandated inspection frequency. The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans. Mandatory recall. The FSMA provides the FDA with a more flexible standard for administratively detaining products that are potentially in violation of the law.

In addition, the FDA is directed to establish pilot projects to explore and evaluate methods to rapidly and effectively identify recipients of food to prevent or control a foodborne illness outbreak. Additional recordkeeping for high-risk foods. The FDA must establish a voluntary program for importers that provides for expedited review and entry of foods from participating importers. The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third-party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the United States.

In 2017, according to the HCMC Medical Equipment Association, Vietnam spent USD1.1 billion on medical equipment imports, which is mainly diagnostic imaging equipment such as X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scanners, as well as equipment used for surgery, endoscopy, sterilization, testing and medical waste treatment. According to the Asian Development Bank, Vietnam is in the top 3 countries with the fastest economic growth in Asia. This can be seen through Vietnam’s gross domestic product (GDP) increasing to 7.08% in 2018, the highest in the past 11 years. Local producers have only been able to supply basic medical supplies such as scissors, rubber health products, scalpels, hospital beds and other disposable supplies which according to MOH means 90% of medical devices in Vietnam need to be imported. Consequently, much of Vietnam’s spending on pharmaceuticals is on imports. The MOH data shows that the country’s drug imports last year increased by 8.8% year-on-year to US$3.7 billion.Therefore, the government is looking to the private sector to meet some of the demands being placed on the industry, designating healthcare as one of 17 sectors open to foreign investment in January 2016. What are the challenges? Vietnam is not a market for inexperienced exporters. In Vietnam, the government requires all new drugs to go through registration and clinical trials, before they can be sold to the public. As part of the WTO membership, foreign enterprises have been given the right to open branches in Vietnam and to import medicines directly. However, illegal copying,fake and low-quality drugs remain commonplace. Part of the problem is because the government has few resources to tackle the problem. Previously, imported medical devices did not require MA licenses. Additionally, imports of used and refurbished medical equipment are strictly controlled by MOH. Because of the restriction, local companies are generally not willing to deal with foreign suppliers of used and refurbished equipment. The Ministry of Health has recently issued Decree No.155/2018/ND-CP, which has many positive changes towards cutting procedures and creating favourable conditions for businesses in tenders, drug imports, and others. Additionally, the Vietnam government also encourages foreign investment by putting forward a wide range of incentives for private healthcare sector, such as incentive tax rates (corporate income tax rate of 10% throughout the project life span)and zero tariff. This aims to prevent the sales of drugs without prescription, which has always been common practice in Vietnam.

        "context": "In recent years, the authorities have stepped up their efforts to reduce the country’s reliance on imports. In 2017, according to the HCMC Medical Equipment Association, Vietnam spent USD1.1 billion on medical equipment imports, which is mainly diagnostic imaging equipment such as X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scanners, as well as equipment used for surgery, endoscopy, sterilization, testing and medical waste treatment. According to the Asian Development Bank, Vietnam is in the top 3 countries with the fastest economic growth in Asia. This can be seen through Vietnam’s gross domestic product (GDP) increasing to 7.08% in 2018, the highest in the past 11 years. Local producers have only been able to supply basic medical supplies such as scissors, rubber health products, scalpels, hospital beds and other disposable supplies which according to MOH means 90% of medical devices in Vietnam need to be imported. Consequently, much of Vietnam’s spending on pharmaceuticals is on imports. The MOH data shows that the country’s drug imports last year increased by 8.8% year-on-year to US$3.7 billion.Therefore, the government is looking to the private sector to meet some of the demands being placed on the industry, designating healthcare as one of 17 sectors open to foreign investment in January 2016. What are the challenges? Vietnam is not a market for inexperienced exporters. In Vietnam, the government requires all new drugs to go through registration and clinical trials, before they can be sold to the public. As part of the WTO membership, foreign enterprises have been given the right to open branches in Vietnam and to import medicines directly. However, illegal copying,fake and low-quality drugs remain commonplace. Part of the problem is because the government has few resources to tackle the problem. Previously, imported medical devices did not require MA licenses. Additionally, imports of used and refurbished medical equipment are strictly controlled by MOH. Because of the restriction, local companies are generally not willing to deal with foreign suppliers of used and refurbished equipment. The Ministry of Health has recently issued Decree No.155/2018/ND-CP, which has many positive changes towards cutting procedures and creating favourable conditions for businesses in tenders, drug imports, and others. Additionally, the Vietnam government also encourages foreign investment by putting forward a wide range of incentives for private healthcare sector, such as incentive tax rates (corporate income tax rate of 10% throughout the project life span)and zero tariff. This aims to prevent the sales of drugs without prescription, which has always been common practice in Vietnam.

The committee's report, which Kerry endorsed, stated there was \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\" In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and fellow Vietnam veteran John McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization. In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam. Kerry was the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1987 to 1989. In January 2009, Kerry replaced Joe Biden as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Bioo Therapeutics is a division of Bioo Scientific, is an Austin, TX based biotechnology company that provides innovative solutions to the life science industry. Bioo Therapeutics is a division of Bioo Scientific, is an Austin, TX based biotechnology company that provides innovative solutions to the life science industry. Based on Bioo Scientific’s patent-pending technology, Dr Joe Krebs and Ms. Jessica Brill, developed a test that meets the requirements of low-cost, speed and simplicity which are desperately needed by food and feed safety customers; a community comprised of government regulatory agencies such as USDA and FDA analysts, as well as academic labs, food processing plants and retailers. Bioo Scientific Corporation is an Austin, TX based biotechnology company that provides innovative solutions to the life science industry. As a world leader in food safety testing, Bioo Scientific is dedicated to improving the safety of the world’s food and feed supply by developing accurate, affordable tools, which allow companies to readily screen for pathogens and contaminants. The safety of the public food supply is an important global public health issue. Because of recent food contamination incidents, Congress just passed a sweeping reform of the food-safety system that will require improved testing of domestically produced and imported food. As a demonstration of the commitment by the US government to food safety, Bioo Scientific was awarded a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II grant totaling $350,000 from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the development of a new technology to detect the presence of contaminants in food and feed. According to Lance Ford, Bioo Scientific’s VP of Research and Business Development, “While technologies are widely available for RNAi agent delivery into cells grown on plastic dishes in specially designed incubators, to fully understand gene functions and\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, the nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was enacted in 2011 and provided FDA with the authorities to transform the food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness and other food hazards to preventing them. Over the last five years, FDA has provided training and technical assistance to industry partners to facilitate understanding and compliance with the new standards; developed tools that will provide the information needed to focus decisions and resources on areas of greatest risk; increased capacity to support an integrated food safety system, and conducted 7,020 high-risk food establishment inspections. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Nutrition Facts label, which is a label required on most packaged foods, has not changed significantly since the requirements were first introduced in 1993. FDA has proposed to update the Nutrition Facts label to reflect new public health and scientific information, including evidence on nutrition, obesity and chronic disease. One change includes updating the label to better reflect a single serving, which has changed in the decades since the original nutrition label was created. Informed food choices is another step towards addressing the current obesity rate estimated to be over one third of the country. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. This commitment is reflected in the\n\nSmart Food was selected by USAID and Australia as winning innovation for 2017 at Global Platform Launch Food \n\nThe STARTEC Decision Support Tool offers several features and capabilities to the food industry for making informed decisions about food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs in the production of ready-to-eat foods. This tool was developed with the input of participating food companies in the STARTEC project, using real-life production scenarios of complex ready-to-eat foods. It uses a pasta salad meal as a case product but can be customized to other ready-to-eat food products. Key parameters such as pH, water activity, costs of ingredients and salaries, as well as default models for calculations of Listeria monocytogenes, quality scores, and vitamin C, are placed in an interactive database. Users can customize the models and settings based on their specific needs. This allows the user to assess the impact of different decisions on food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs. It has been tested and approved by end-users based on selected ready-to-eat food products. It provides a comprehensive approach and assists users in optimizing their production processes for ready-to-eat foods. according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year about 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die in the United States from foodborne diseases. Hardly a day goes by when there isn’t a recall of food contaminated by a variety of microorganisms, oftentimes E. coli or salmonella. The foodborne illnesses caused by these contaminated products do not just result in stomachaches. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011. It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system. It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. The law is another milestone in food safety—the latest step to supplement hazard analysis and critical control point programs that have been mandated for a variety of commodities. About 15% of the U.S. food supply is imported. This increasing globalization of the food chain requires that the United States take a stronger role in helping other countries manage their sanitation levels and the care with which those commodities are treated. The food supply is more complex and high tech than in the past. There is more food in the marketplace, and there are new hazards in foods that we have not previously seen. Demographics are shifting, and the population of individuals who are at risk from foodborne illnesses has increased by 30%, according to the CDC and World Health Organization. What is so historic about the FSMA is that it involves creation of a new food safety system and implements a broad prevention mandate and accountability, plus a new system of import oversight. Building this new food safety system based on prevention will take time, and the FDA is creating a process for accomplishing this. Some authorizations, such as the FDA’s new authority to order companies to recall food, will go into effect quickly. The funding the agency gets each year, which affects staffing and vital operations, will also influence how quickly the FDA can put this legislation into effect. The FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships. For the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply. Mandatory preventive controls for food facilities. Food facilities are required to implement written preventive control plans. This involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise. Authority to prevent intentional contamination. The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points. The final rule regarding intentional contamination is due within 18 months of enactment. The FDA must establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards and those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally during processing. They also must address materials added to the soil (such as compost), hygiene, packaging, temperature controls and animals in the growing area and water. The FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans. The FSMA requires certain food testing to be performed by accredited laboratories and directs the FDA to establish a program for laboratory accreditation to ensure that U.S. food testing laboratories meet quality standards. The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA.

Bioo Therapeutics is a division of Bioo Scientific, is an Austin, TX based biotechnology company that provides innovative solutions to the life science industry. Based on Bioo Scientific’s patent-pending technology, Dr Joe Krebs and Ms. Jessica Brill, developed a test that meets the requirements of low-cost, speed and simplicity which are desperately needed by food and feed safety customers; a community comprised of government regulatory agencies such as USDA and FDA analysts, as well as academic labs, food processing plants and retailers. Bioo Scientific Corporation is an Austin, TX based biotechnology company that provides innovative solutions to the life science industry. As a world leader in food safety testing, Bioo Scientific is dedicated to improving the safety of the world’s food and feed supply by developing accurate, affordable tools, which allow companies to readily screen for pathogens and contaminants. The safety of the public food supply is an important global public health issue. Because of recent food contamination incidents, Congress just passed a sweeping reform of the food-safety system that will require improved testing of domestically produced and imported food. As a demonstration of the commitment by the US government to food safety, Bioo Scientific was awarded a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II grant totaling $350,000 from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the development of a new technology to detect the presence of contaminants in food and feed. According to Lance Ford, Bioo Scientific’s VP of Research and Business Development, “While technologies are widely available for RNAi agent delivery into cells grown on plastic dishes in specially designed incubators, to fully understand gene functions and\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, the nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was enacted in 2011 and provided FDA with the authorities to transform the food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness and other food hazards to preventing them. Over the last five years, FDA has provided training and technical assistance to industry partners to facilitate understanding and compliance with the new standards; developed tools that will provide the information needed to focus decisions and resources on areas of greatest risk; increased capacity to support an integrated food safety system, and conducted 7,020 high-risk food establishment inspections. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Nutrition Facts label, which is a label required on most packaged foods, has not changed significantly since the requirements were first introduced in 1993. FDA has proposed to update the Nutrition Facts label to reflect new public health and scientific information, including evidence on nutrition, obesity and chronic disease. One change includes updating the label to better reflect a single serving, which has changed in the decades since the original nutrition label was created. Informed food choices is another step towards addressing the current obesity rate estimated to be over one third of the country. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. This commitment is reflected in the\n\nSmart Food was selected by USAID and Australia as winning innovation for 2017 at Global Platform Launch Food \n\nThe STARTEC Decision Support Tool offers several features and capabilities to the food industry for making informed decisions about food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs in the production of ready-to-eat foods. This tool was developed with the input of participating food companies in the STARTEC project, using real-life production scenarios of complex ready-to-eat foods. It uses a pasta salad meal as a case product but can be customized to other ready-to-eat food products. Key parameters such as pH, water activity, costs of ingredients and salaries, as well as default models for calculations of Listeria monocytogenes, quality scores, and vitamin C, are placed in an interactive database. Users can customize the models and settings based on their specific needs. This allows the user to assess the impact of different decisions on food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs. It has been tested and approved by end-users based on selected ready-to-eat food products. It provides a comprehensive approach and assists users in optimizing their production processes for ready-to-eat foods. according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year about 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die in the United States from foodborne diseases. Hardly a day goes by when there isn’t a recall of food contaminated by a variety of microorganisms, oftentimes E. coli or salmonella. The foodborne illnesses caused by these contaminated products do not just result in stomachaches. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011. It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system. It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. The law is another milestone in food safety—the latest step to supplement hazard analysis and critical control point programs that have been mandated for a variety of commodities. About 15% of the U.S. food supply is imported. This increasing globalization of the food chain requires that the United States take a stronger role in helping other countries manage their sanitation levels and the care with which those commodities are treated. The food supply is more complex and high tech than in the past. There is more food in the marketplace, and there are new hazards in foods that we have not previously seen. Demographics are shifting, and the population of individuals who are at risk from foodborne illnesses has increased by 30%, according to the CDC and World Health Organization. What is so historic about the FSMA is that it involves creation of a new food safety system and implements a broad prevention mandate and accountability, plus a new system of import oversight. Building this new food safety system based on prevention will take time, and the FDA is creating a process for accomplishing this. Some authorizations, such as the FDA’s new authority to order companies to recall food, will go into effect quickly. The funding the agency gets each year, which affects staffing and vital operations, will also influence how quickly the FDA can put this legislation into effect. The FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships. For the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply. Mandatory preventive controls for food facilities. Food facilities are required to implement written preventive control plans. This involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise. Authority to prevent intentional contamination. The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points. The final rule regarding intentional contamination is due within 18 months of enactment. The FDA must establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards and those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally during processing. They also must address materials added to the soil (such as compost), hygiene, packaging, temperature controls and animals in the growing area and water. The FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans. The FSMA requires certain food testing to be performed by accredited laboratories and directs the FDA to establish a program for laboratory accreditation to ensure that U.S. food testing laboratories meet quality standards. The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA. The FDA can suspend registration of a facility if it determines the food poses a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. A facility that is under suspension is prohibited from distributing food. Enhanced product tracing abilities.

In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism. Women's and civil rights movements The women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967. Emory's diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech\n\nClinical education is conducted in eight sites, all of which have rich and different characteristics. From emergency services and intensive care, to life-saving surgeries and minimally-invasive procedures, University of Miami Hospital and Clinics advanced care by the region’s top physicians. With 560 private rooms, UMH provides patients with personalized treatment in a high-quality environment. Founded in 1836 as \"Emory College\" by the Methodist Episcopal Church and named in honor of Methodist bishop John Emory, Emory is the second-oldest private institution of higher education in Georgia (after Mercer University, founded in 1833). Emory University has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology. Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. The university operates the Confucius Institute in Atlanta in partnership with Nanjing University. Emory University students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign countries. Emory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the state of Georgia and comprises seven major hospitals, including the Emory University Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown. The university operates the Winship Cancer Institute, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, and many disease and vaccine research centers. The university is one of four institutions involved in the NIAID's Tuberculosis Research Units Program. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society are national affiliate institutions located adjacent to the campus. The university is partnered with the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Carter Center. The National Science Foundation ranked the university 36th among academic institutions in the United States for research and development (R&D) expenditures. In 1995 Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities, an association of the 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. Emory faculty and alumni include two Prime Ministers, nine university presidents, 11 members of the United States Congress, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a Vice President of the United States, a United States Speaker of the House, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include 21 Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Emmy Award winners, MacArthur Fellows, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, an Olympic gold medalist and Doug Demuro. History Nineteenth century Emory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment.

In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Psychologist Clive Hazell, for example, attributes feelings of emptiness to problematic family backgrounds with abusive relationships and mistreatment. In political philosophy, emptiness is associated with nihilism. The concept of \"emptiness\" was important to a \"certain type of existentialist philosophy and some forms of the Death of God movement\". Existentialists argue that \"man lives in alienation from God, from nature, from other men, from his own true self.\" Christianity In Austrian philosopher/educator Rudolf Steiner's (1861–1925) thinking, spiritual emptiness was a major problem in the educated European middle class. In his 1919 lectures he argued that European culture became \"empty of spirit\" and \"ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit\". People experienced a \"spiritual emptiness\" and their thinking became marked by a \"lazy passivity\" due to the \"absence of will from the life of thought\". In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would \"allow their thoughts to take possession of them\", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and \"pure, natural scientific thinking\". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was \"devoid of spirit\", with their minds becoming \"dimmer and darker\", and increasing empty of spirit. Louis Dupré, a professor of philosophy at Yale University, argues that the \"spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty\". He claims that boys can be helped by giving them \"a sense of purpose\" and \"spiritual anchors\" that can \"anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking\". Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception, he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. The concept of \"emptiness\" was important to a \"good deal of 19th–20th century Western imaginative literature\". Novelist Franz Kafka depicted a meaningless bizarre world in The Trial and the existentialist French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in Jean-Paul Sartre's La Nausée and Albert Camus' L'étranger. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet T.S. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\" Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. The \"Patriots\", an insulting term used by the British that was proudly adopted by the Americans, stressed the constitutional rights of Englishmen, especially \"No taxation without representation.\" Contemporaries credited the American Enlightenment with laying the intellectual, moral and ethical foundations of the Revolution among the Founding Fathers. Founders referred to the liberalism in the philosophy of John Locke as powerful influences. Although Two Treatises of Government has long been cited as a major influence on American thinkers, historians David Lundberg and Henry F. May demonstrate that Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding was far more widely read than were his political Treatises. Historians since the 1960s have emphasized that \n\n John Locke (1632–1704) is often referred to as \"the philosopher of the American Revolution\" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology. Locke's Two Treatises of Government published in 1689 was especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the \"consent of the governed\". In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in \"equality by creation\" and \"rights by creation\". Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The theory of the social contract influenced the belief among many of the Founders that the right of the people to overthrow their leaders was one of the \"natural rights\" of man, should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen. The colonists associated political corruption with ostentatious luxury and inherited aristocracy, which they condemned. The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires.

Periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient communities along the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers, the Nile River, the Indus River, the Ganges and the Yellow River among others.

In this paper we tell the story of a workshop we facilitated for young people affected by these sorts of symptoms. We will go on to explain how we made use of experience consultants and outsider witness practices and describe the effects of the workshop on the young people who took part. A process of mutual witnessing between these two groups (‘young people’ and ‘experience consultants’) opened space for stories of hope to be told and lived. The discourses informing systemic and narrative approaches differ from the traditional medical discourse that uses the language of diagnosis, designates young people as ‘patients’ and assumes that medical tests can objectively distinguish the ‘reality’ of symptoms. Like Michael White we hold that we live our lives according to the stories we tell ourselves and the stories we are told by others . These stories talk to us of who we are, who we were and who we can become. Thus our stories are constitutive, both forming and informing our identities. Michael White described our sense of self as a ‘territory of identity’. He explained how problems like trauma can act to shrink this territory, our sense of who we are, thereby disconnecting us from our abilities to influence our own lives and those of others. Without a sense of who we are it is difficult to go on, to make decisions, to dream of our future, since to participate in these life affirming activities, we need to be standing on the safe ground of who we are. Narrative practices involve enabling people to tell stories about their lives in ways that make them stronger [9,10] or enables them to go on. For these stories to live and breathe they also need an audience. Even when preferred stories begin to emerge in therapy, they are often witnessed by only a therapist and one or two family members and therefore risk remaining fragile. The Narrative approach offers practices to extend the audience to these stories through the use of certificates, letters and celebrations [11-13]. Outsider witnessing also offers the opportunity to invite an audience to witness preferred identity stories. Inspired by Barbara Myerhoff’s work with older Jewish people in California, Michael White developed outsider witnessing practices, which create opportunities to invite an audience to witness people’s preferred identity stories . In outsider witnessing one or several people are invited to join a session. Michael White talks of how the witnesses’ response to the ‘Transport’ question (eg How is your life / work different for what you have heard today?) is particularly important. Hearing the impact that their story has had on others and the contribution their story makes to others’ lives can be a validating experience that opens space for further positive developments of self [2,16]. When we evaluated the group, the young people fed back that they liked meeting others like themselves who were living with similar symptoms or conditions. It was from their\n\nWhat was the impetus for entering the field of Hospice and Palliative Medicine? I knew there had to be some way to help these suffering patients die comfortably and with dignity. Was there any specific incident that lead you into the research of NDE’s (Neardeath experiences) and PDE’s (Pre death experiences)? Since all doctors were busy with patients, I cared for the elderly gentleman who had a better chance of survival. This began a career where stories like this one were a rule and notan exception. Essentially, when I was caring for terminally ill AIDS and cancer patients in the hospital. Deceased families would appear after the spiritual beings and usually with a few days of their death. At the end, most would rally with incredible energy and would tell their family and friends goodbye and at times describe their visions. After seeing hundred of patients dying, including murderers, Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Jews, and most claiming to see the same apparitions at similar times before their death, I knew there had to be more to the experiences that modern medicine had not been willing to research. The most well-known example being the pre-death experience of Jesus of Nazareth. He foresaw His death and resurrection and told of seeing and speaking to angels and deceased prophets, all which appeared to Him so as to help with His transition. Prior to His death and while on nailed to the cross, He left us with knowledge of hoe to live our life’s and how to die and what awaited us. What He explains is similar to the descriptions and messages that many of my patients leave with me. In the book, more is described. What other noted civilizations and people described the pre-death experience? The Egyptians, Sumerians and Plato describe pre-death experiences in their writings. The Romans, a second century Rabbi Yochar wrote about death bed visions in his book entitled The Book of Splendor. Abraham Lincoln told his best friend a dream of his death just days before he was assassinated. A twentieth-century well-known physicist named Sir William Barrett, who worked with the famous physicist Dr. Tindell studied this phenomenon and wrote a book in 1926 entitled Death Bed Visions – 1926. He described visions the dying described just days to hours before their death. These visions included deceased loved one and spiritual beings coming to guide them to the other-side. Can you describe the timing of these visions or non-linear conscious awareness? Can you tell us about a story that stands out in your mind? They are all beautiful stories however the story of Matthew is dear to my heart. He was so unselfish and spoke of his three angels he called Gabby, Raphy and Noe. He said they were quite large angels that were there to keep him from feeling pain and to fulfill his purpose for being born. That was to help redirect his mom’s soul as well as his sisters back to God. He gave several prophecies about our world and my life. He told me about two weeks before his death the day he would go back to God. He died on that day and almost to the exact time. Did patients ever see hell or talk about the devil? Only a few, and most explained it as a self separation from God that comes from not being able to forgive oneself or love oneself as we are ready to transition. I have made it my mission to sit down with all patients especially those who have deep darkness in their life, on how to find that forgiveness and self love. Stories of other patients truly help them find hope. This is one of the main reasons I wrote this book… a book full of hope and love by telling story after story of my patient’s experiences with the angels and how loving and understanding God truly is! How do you propose to improve this lack of knowledge with regards to the process of dying?

T. Max about the extent of Lish's editing of Carver's short stories which was visible in manuscripts held at the Lilly Library. Before his death, Carver had written to Lish: “If I have any standing or reputation or credibility in the world, I owe it to you.” In December 2007, The New Yorker published an earlier and much longer draft of Carver's story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" under Carver's title, \"Beginners.\" The magazine published Lish's extensive edits of the story on \n\n Hollis gives a detailed picture of Thomas' life and the poet's inner struggles. Thomas, Hollis writes, suffered through chronic depression, with Thomas stating that he felt \"plagued with work, burning my candle at 3 ends\" with frequent thoughts of suicide and vicious verbal sparring with his wife Helen. Walking through the English countrysides offered Thomas some relief. Still, it took Thomas' meeting with Robert Frost, an immigrant from the U.S. seeking to break into English literary circles, in 1913 to change his life's path. Frost's relationship to Thomas, as Hollis discusses, essentially saved Thomas' life. Their friendship serves as the heart of the book. Hollis details how the two poets spent hours \"talks-walking\", in Frost's words, around the bucolic \n\nThis page is currently being updated to serve you better. For example, a dumped coffee on the ground “I can’t believe someone dumped out their coffee here. They should have dumped it in the garbage can” or “Too bad, someone accidentally spilled their coffee” are beliefs and a story based on the coffee on the ground. It impacts a marriage at all levels; friendship; fondness and admiration, intimacy, positivity, resolving conflict, repairing the relationship, how issues are raised, being open to the others’ thoughts and opinions, de-escalating and calming down, compromising, and creating lifelong dreams and meaning (Gottman, 2002). It is devastating and undeniably painful given that trust is broken, love and admiration are crushed, and it feels impossible to sort out. For the faithful partner, it means understanding this is a trauma and as such, Post Trauma Stress Disorder Symptoms are common such as intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, numbing, hyper-arousal, anxiety, panicky feelings, and an inability to think about anything else. And that is just the beginning. While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like –hoping the feelings of affection will follow later– a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. “Love is a choice,” says Chapman. “And either partner can start the process today.” —Cindy Crosby. This text refers to the Amazon.com Exclusive Journal & Paperback Book Set. A therapist herself, relationship expert Michele Weiner Davis accurately (and often humorously) shows how typical counseling and communications tactics backfire. After a myth-busting lecture on the realities of divorce, Weiner Davis thoroughly outlines her simple plan. Intimidating discussion topics and emotional letter writing are not required; as she succinctly puts it, “happiness is a do-it-yourself job.” Poignant questions help readers define their own needs, set specific marriage goals, and monitor results. Weiner Davis pays special attention to issues of infidelity, depression,\n\nQuestion: What city was the author of What We Talk About When We Talk About love born in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Without a sense of who we are it is difficult to go on, to make decisions, to dream of our future, since to participate in these life affirming activities, we need to be standing on the safe ground of who we are. Narrative practices involve enabling people to tell stories about their lives in ways that make them stronger [9,10] or enables them to go on. For these stories to live and breathe they also need an audience. Even when preferred stories begin to emerge in therapy, they are often witnessed by only a therapist and one or two family members and therefore risk remaining fragile. The Narrative approach offers practices to extend the audience to these stories through the use of certificates, letters and celebrations [11-13]. Outsider witnessing also offers the opportunity to invite an audience to witness preferred identity stories. Inspired by Barbara Myerhoff’s work with older Jewish people in California, Michael White developed outsider witnessing practices, which create opportunities to invite an audience to witness people’s preferred identity stories . In outsider witnessing one or several people are invited to join a session. Michael White talks of how the witnesses’ response to the ‘Transport’ question (eg How is your life / work different for what you have heard today?) is particularly important. Hearing the impact that their story has had on others and the contribution their story makes to others’ lives can be a validating experience that opens space for further positive developments of self [2,16]. When we evaluated the group, the young people fed back that they liked meeting others like themselves who were living with similar symptoms or conditions. It was from their\n\nWhat was the impetus for entering the field of Hospice and Palliative Medicine? I knew there had to be some way to help these suffering patients die comfortably and with dignity. Was there any specific incident that lead you into the research of NDE’s (Neardeath experiences) and PDE’s (Pre death experiences)? Since all doctors were busy with patients, I cared for the elderly gentleman who had a better chance of survival. This began a career where stories like this one were a rule and notan exception. Essentially, when I was caring for terminally ill AIDS and cancer patients in the hospital. Deceased families would appear after the spiritual beings and usually with a few days of their death. At the end, most would rally with incredible energy and would tell their family and friends goodbye and at times describe their visions. After seeing hundred of patients dying, including murderers, Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Jews, and most claiming to see the same apparitions at similar times before their death, I knew there had to be more to the experiences that modern medicine had not been willing to research. The most well-known example being the pre-death experience of Jesus of Nazareth. He foresaw His death and resurrection and told of seeing and speaking to angels and deceased prophets, all which appeared to Him so as to help with His transition. Prior to His death and while on nailed to the cross, He left us with knowledge of hoe to live our life’s and how to die and what awaited us. What He explains is similar to the descriptions and messages that many of my patients leave with me. In the book, more is described. What other noted civilizations and people described the pre-death experience? The Egyptians, Sumerians and Plato describe pre-death experiences in their writings. The Romans, a second century Rabbi Yochar wrote about death bed visions in his book entitled The Book of Splendor. Abraham Lincoln told his best friend a dream of his death just days before he was assassinated. A twentieth-century well-known physicist named Sir William Barrett, who worked with the famous physicist Dr. Tindell studied this phenomenon and wrote a book in 1926 entitled Death Bed Visions – 1926. He described visions the dying described just days to hours before their death. These visions included deceased loved one and spiritual beings coming to guide them to the other-side. Can you describe the timing of these visions or non-linear conscious awareness? Can you tell us about a story that stands out in your mind? They are all beautiful stories however the story of Matthew is dear to my heart. He was so unselfish and spoke of his three angels he called Gabby, Raphy and Noe. He said they were quite large angels that were there to keep him from feeling pain and to fulfill his purpose for being born. That was to help redirect his mom’s soul as well as his sisters back to God. He gave several prophecies about our world and my life. He told me about two weeks before his death the day he would go back to God. He died on that day and almost to the exact time. Did patients ever see hell or talk about the devil? Only a few, and most explained it as a self separation from God that comes from not being able to forgive oneself or love oneself as we are ready to transition. I have made it my mission to sit down with all patients especially those who have deep darkness in their life, on how to find that forgiveness and self love. Stories of other patients truly help them find hope. This is one of the main reasons I wrote this book… a book full of hope and love by telling story after story of my patient’s experiences with the angels and how loving and understanding God truly is! How do you propose to improve this lack of knowledge with regards to the process of dying?

T. Max about the extent of Lish's editing of Carver's short stories which was visible in manuscripts held at the Lilly Library. Before his death, Carver had written to Lish: “If I have any standing or reputation or credibility in the world, I owe it to you.” In December 2007, The New Yorker published an earlier and much longer draft of Carver's story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" under Carver's title, \"Beginners.\" The magazine published Lish's extensive edits of the story on \n\n Hollis gives a detailed picture of Thomas' life and the poet's inner struggles. Thomas, Hollis writes, suffered through chronic depression, with Thomas stating that he felt \"plagued with work, burning my candle at 3 ends\" with frequent thoughts of suicide and vicious verbal sparring with his wife Helen. Walking through the English countrysides offered Thomas some relief. Still, it took Thomas' meeting with Robert Frost, an immigrant from the U.S. seeking to break into English literary circles, in 1913 to change his life's path. Frost's relationship to Thomas, as Hollis discusses, essentially saved Thomas' life. Their friendship serves as the heart of the book. Hollis details how the two poets spent hours \"talks-walking\", in Frost's words, around the bucolic \n\nThis page is currently being updated to serve you better. For example, a dumped coffee on the ground “I can’t believe someone dumped out their coffee here. They should have dumped it in the garbage can” or “Too bad, someone accidentally spilled their coffee” are beliefs and a story based on the coffee on the ground. It impacts a marriage at all levels; friendship; fondness and admiration, intimacy, positivity, resolving conflict, repairing the relationship, how issues are raised, being open to the others’ thoughts and opinions, de-escalating and calming down, compromising, and creating lifelong dreams and meaning (Gottman, 2002). It is devastating and undeniably painful given that trust is broken, love and admiration are crushed, and it feels impossible to sort out. For the faithful partner, it means understanding this is a trauma and as such, Post Trauma Stress Disorder Symptoms are common such as intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, numbing, hyper-arousal, anxiety, panicky feelings, and an inability to think about anything else. And that is just the beginning. While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like –hoping the feelings of affection will follow later– a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. “Love is a choice,” says Chapman. “And either partner can start the process today.” —Cindy Crosby. This text refers to the Amazon.com Exclusive Journal & Paperback Book Set. A therapist herself, relationship expert Michele Weiner Davis accurately (and often humorously) shows how typical counseling and communications tactics backfire. After a myth-busting lecture on the realities of divorce, Weiner Davis thoroughly outlines her simple plan. Intimidating discussion topics and emotional letter writing are not required; as she succinctly puts it, “happiness is a do-it-yourself job.” Poignant questions help readers define their own needs, set specific marriage goals, and monitor results. Weiner Davis pays special attention to issues of infidelity, depression,\n\n"

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals\nDow Chemical acquired controlling interest of the Merrell pharmaceutical division of Richardson-Merrell company in 1980 and it became Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. In 1985, Richardson-Vicks was acquired by Procter & Gamble. The merger was considered a good fit because of Marion Laboratories strong sales force and Merrell Dow's strong research and development capabilities. Dow's initial offer was $38 a share in cash, or $2.2 billion, for the 39 percent of Marion's 150 million shares with an option to raise the stake to 67 percent by 1992. The deal created the fifth largest drug company in the United States in terms of sales. Although controlled by Dow the new company continued to trade on Marion Laboratories' old New York Stock Exchange  ticker symbol \"MKC.\" Kauffman later said he used his middle name for the company to avoid the impression that it was a one-person operation. As the company expanded, Kauffman offered employees share options and profit sharing. Rather than researching products, the company adopted a policy of buying existing products and reformulating them for market. In 1989, Marion Laboratories had a gross revenue of $930 million; it was acquired by Dow Chemical and took the name Marion Merrell Dow. By 1994 it had nearly 10,000 employees. Hoechst Marion Roussel\nIn 1995 Hoechst AG of Germany announced plans to buy Dow's increased 71 percent share for $25.75 a share or $7.1 Billion. Hoechst also bought the other outstanding shares. The deal created the world's second largest drug manufacturer at the time (behind Glaxo Wellcome and ahead of Merck & Company). Sanofi \nHoechst in turn later became part of the pharmaceutical and lab assay testing company Aventis in 1999, and subsequently a part of the multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi. In August 2009 the company announced its plans to close the remaining facility altogether.\n\n"

In the year of Anne's death and the coronation of George I, Frederick's parents, George, Prince of Wales (later George II), and Caroline of Ansbach, were called upon to leave Hanover for Great Britain when their eldest son was only seven years old. He was left in the care of his grand-uncle Ernest Augustus, Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, and did not see his parents again for 14 \n\n  When Austria joined the ranks of the allies during the War of the Sixth Coalition, Charles was not given a command and the post of commander-in-chief of the allied Grand Army of Bohemia went to the Prince of Schwarzenberg. Charles spent the rest of his life in retirement, except for a short time in 1815 when he was military governor of the Fortress Mainz. On 15 September/17 September 1815 in Weilburg, Charles married Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797–1829). She was a daughter of Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg (1768–1816) and his wife Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg. Prince Charles Gonthier was born in Arnstadt, the third child of Hereditary Prince Gonthier Frederick Charles and his first wife, Princess Marie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. As such, upon the abdication of his grandfather, Prince Gonthier Frederick Charles I, on 19 August 1835, he became Hereditary Prince and heir apparent to his father, who became Prince Gonthier Frederick Charles II. In 1850 Prince Charles Gonthier enrolled at the University of Bonn to begin his studies in law and literature. Also in 1850, he embarked upon a career in the Prussian Army, being appointed an Oberleutnant. On 12 June 1869 Prince Charles Gonthier was married in Altenburg to Princess Marie Gasparine of Saxe-Altenburg, Duchess of Saxony, the daughter of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\n"

They’re looking for health related news, help with diagnosis, and finding appropriate healthcare providers. Dr. Val: What role can online community play in encouraging people to engage in healthy lifestyles that may prevent chronic disease? Rother: Our experience is that online communities can be extremely helpful in several ways. Whether it’s weight loss, exercise, or quitting smoking – online communities can be just as effective in encouraging behavior change as a face-to-face community. What do you think of this technology? Rother: I think information technology is going to have all kinds of beneficial applications for people with health challenges. General information is helpful, but personalized information is the key. The more these technologies allow you to have your own individual information at your fingertips and allow that to be the basis for recommendations and decision support, the more powerful it’s going to be. Dr. Val: In your opinion, what role does health IT have in reducing healthcare costs and improving access to care? It can decrease costs by reducing duplication. IT can also reduce the cost of health insurance, in the way that online car insurance has reduced car insurance premiums. If we could get everyone to copy the best hospital practices, we’d have a much more manageable problem. It’s just that we’re not organized very well and the system has become fragmented. So you put that all together and you have a pretty big agenda for change. I don’t know if we can achieve this all at once, or if it will occupy us for several years.

We spent the afternoon down at CHOP having a fetal echo cardiogram and talking about treatments with the providers there. They have no idea what causes this to happen, but it is very rare & up until 30 years ago, was always a lethal defect. If there are other problems, her survival rate will be significantly decreased. They suggested that we have the amniocentesis if it would cause us to electively terminate the pregnancy (this is NOT on the table) or so that we can prepare for other things to come, but it didn’t sound like there was any real benefit to the baby (& there are some risks including induction of preterm labor), so we are weighing the risks & benefits of that. We would like to have the baby at CHOP so that I’m not stuck in recovery at Lehigh Valley while our little one is being treated elsewhere. I am overwhelmed and quite honestly, heartbroken -I may spontaneously burst into tears at any given time over the next couple of months. We appreciate all of your prayers and messages of love and support. (If anyone at LVHN feels compelled to donate even a tiny amount of vacation to us, we would be extremely grateful - and I know that’s asking a lot, so believe me, it isn’t expected). Here is the video that CHOP suggested we share with friends and family. I will share updates here as we have them (but they will be sparse for the first few months). Thank you so much for your prayers, Randi, & for your amazingly kind offer to share your hard earned PTO - I would be happy to return the favor if ever you need it!

Look up the song \"Just be held\". When can we donate PTO for you? I tried to read the song lyrics, but dissolved into tears pretty quickly... but thank you so much for the sweet sentiment. I think you can send the paperwork any time, but the PTO doesn’t get deducted from your \"bank\" until I run out of days - which will probably be December, depending on when the baby is born. We can’t thank you enough for considering donating. Big hugs. Kiira Faith Kinkle was born October 12, 2014. Right now, Kiira’s doctors feel that she has a mild case based on her presentation, but that can change as she gets older, wounds get bigger and deeper and more difficult to heal. Unfortunately, this is not a favaorable mutation, and it means that no matter how much we try to protect Kiira, her skin won’t ever produce it and she will always be at risk, externally and internally (mouth and esophagus). However, we have to keep remembering that Kiira has her own genetic make-up and some of that could override the lack of Collagen VII, making her have a more mild case. We do know that she can wear clothes and diapers, and she is eating and gaining weight. Saw your story on KCRA this morning. My hope and prayer for Kiira is that she too will grow out of this and lead a healthy normal life. I to go to Stanford hospital for my skin care. First of all congrats on your new baby. I would like to tell you my experience with EB. I love to educate people about it and want to help raise awareness. reading your story made me feel sorry for your baby. Firstly congratulations on the birth of your beautiful daughter. Both the boys attend school and have many friends which is very different from my days at school but these days people are a lot more accepting and there are also a lot more resources than there used to be. Nutrition is her answer. Wish Kiira a merry Christmas from me. He is an adult now and while he has scarring and needs to be extra careful with sun screen, his life is totally normal and sometimes we all forget that he even has EB. Blisters and bandage changes were a normal part of his early life, but everything slowly improved as he aged. Aww baby Kira. Our daughter Cattaleya was born 10/15/14 with DEB. She is the strongest person I know. As she screams in pain all I can do is cry with her. I had a friend who son had somewhat of the same thing. He had to be wrap in sheepskin that was the only thing he could have touch his skin. I think you are doing an amazing job with all of your children and God is your sustainor. Like you God always shows up when I think I haven’t an ounce of strength in me to move on and He comforts me. My husband was with her in the ER all day…I was with her in the ER all day two days ago…..I tell you all of this because I prayed after I put my two little ones to bed and I believe God gave me an answer. He gave me an idea to play scripture over and over as my children sleep at night. I am putting your daughter on a prayer list. You truly have a one a million baby.

In 2012, Holliday met Australian businessman, photographer and artist Nick Holliday on Tumblr. They talked online for seven months before Holliday traveled to the U.S. to visit, and in April 2015, he moved from Melbourne to the U.S. On July 5, 2014, they got engaged. They secretly wed one year later on July 5, 2015. In January 2016, it was announced that Holliday was pregnant and expected to give birth in June. Holliday gave birth to her second son in June 2016. She and Nick Holliday have since divorced. She was born Ryann Hoven but changed her name to Tess Munster (a surname she chose \n\n His son, Ricki Olsen, is a professional footballer. Tell me a little bit about your job and more specifically about you Neonatal Comfort Care Program. Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. I took care of her every day, making sure she could spend time with her family and be comfortable. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. After her, I started following other mothers and other babies and the number of families I have been following has been greatly increasing over time. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Just to give you an idea, in 2008 I followed thirteen families, while in 2017, more than 100. So, is a lot of the work about talking to the families? Definitely. These families are confronted with very bad news. Imagine: You discover you are having a baby, what joyful news! It’s, I would say, one of the worst news you could receive. You expect old people to die, not little babies. These families haven’t even seen their baby, so it’s very heartbreaking. How can they go through the pregnancy? For instance, when you are pregnant and your belly starts to show, you go to work, and people ask, “When is the baby due? Or when you go grocery shopping. How many times do you see pregnant women in the checkout line and even if you don’t know them, you’ll congratulate them and ask them about the baby’s gender? These families need to learn how to communicate this not only with those outside the family, but even in the family: how to tell the other siblings without crushing their hearts, how to tell your own parents, or figuring out who you want to tell. There is a lot of emotional and psychological support needed, and this is more about what my team does. He or she will only know love and comfort. In short, we do follow the babies along their natural life. I wish I could record the parents when we meet them for the first time. When they come to us, they just say, “I wish I had met you before. You give me hope, you give me life, I can finally talk about my baby.” The parents’ response is an experience of relief in every single case. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. What does it matter if you live eight minutes or eight years? In both cases you want that person to be loved. The parents love this program. The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. We really make a point to emphasize that, yes, it’s going to be excruciating pain and that’s why we will be with them, but we promise that it’s also going to be a celebration of joy and honoring life. And it does happen that way every time. Invariably, parents will send us messages afterwards thanking us for the beautiful moment of celebration of the life of their babies. They send us cards year after year, perhaps with pictures of other babies born after that one, but always remembering the baby with the short life as someone very special. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. From the point of view of the nurses, in the very beginning there was a lot of concern and lack of desire to be part of this project because it is such an unusual scenario. Our proposal is to have baby/family bonding in a private space, so the busy NICU is not a proper place. Ideally these babies should be with mom and family in post-partum, however, the nurses\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the person who plays Batman in the Lego Batman Movie?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

How did it come about? Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. And I should be able to address desires and expectations of their families.” My first case was a little girl with Trisomy 18 who lived for two weeks. It’s easy to make a baby comfortable; a baby needs to be held, warm, and fed, and if he or she has any distress, few drops of pain killer are more than enough. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. After her, I started following other mothers and other babies and the number of families I have been following has been greatly increasing over time. Other professionals were fascinated by this new way to treat babies with short lives and I started being helped by a number of them, but the patients grew so much that I realized that I needed to hire some more professionals. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Therefore, our program is running because of the generosity of donors. Just to give you an idea, in 2008 I followed thirteen families, while in 2017, more than 100. So, is a lot of the work about talking to the families? These families are confronted with very bad news. Imagine: You discover you are having a baby, what joyful news! But suddenly you learn from the obstetricians that your baby has something really bad that will make his or her life short. It’s, I would say, one of the worst news you could receive. You expect old people to die, not little babies. These families come to us asking for help. How can they go through the pregnancy? For instance, when you are pregnant and your belly starts to show, you go to work, and people ask, “When is the baby due? How many times do you see pregnant women in the checkout line and even if you don’t know them, you’ll congratulate them and ask them about the baby’s gender? These families need to learn how to communicate this not only with those outside the family, but even in the family: how to tell the other siblings without crushing their hearts, how to tell your own parents, or figuring out who you want to tell. There is a lot of emotional and psychological support needed, and this is more about what my team does. A baby needs to know only love and comfort. But your baby will not know. He or she will only know love and comfort. As you are pregnant, the baby inside you has no idea what is happening, they’re just happily rolling in the amniotic fluid. And they are not in pain at all. But even after they’re born, they will be held, they will be fed, they will be warm, and they won’t experience any pain. So, their life will be short but, for them, it will be a beautiful experience of love and welcoming.” Depending on the family’s background—religious, social, racial, etc.—we try to craft a plan that follows the medical and non-medical needs of each baby. In short, we do follow the babies along their natural life. I wish I could record the parents when we meet them for the first time. They come to us destroyed. When they come to us, they just say, “I wish I had met you before. You give me hope, you give me life, I can finally talk about my baby.” The parents’ response is an experience of relief in every single case. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. What does it matter if you live eight minutes or eight years? In both cases you want that person to be loved. The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. Fathers especially are very worried about facing the moment of birth followed by death. We really make a point to emphasize that, yes, it’s going to be excruciating pain and that’s why we will be with them, but we promise that it’s also going to be a celebration of joy and honoring life. And it does happen that way every time. Invariably, parents will send us messages afterwards thanking us for the beautiful moment of celebration of the life of their babies. They send us cards year after year, perhaps with pictures of other babies born after that one, but always remembering the baby with the short life as someone very special. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. From the point of view of the nurses, in the very beginning there was a lot of concern and lack of desire to be part of this project because it is such an unusual scenario. Traditionally when babies with a life-limiting condition are born, they are admitted to the NICU for comfort care. However, I am not sure about the “comfort” they receive because they are very often kept in an incubator until they die. Our proposal is to have baby/family bonding in a private space, so the busy NICU is not a proper place. Ideally these babies should be with mom and family in post-partum, however, the nurses\n\n played in the 1980s led to widespread revilement, and being temporarily promoted as best man was a rare affirmation of his character, and he intended to be the 'good guy' by finding a replacement for the photo.

And I looked at her and my heart just filled up with compassion for this lady, and I thought to myself, \"God, she works hard for the money, cooped up in this stinky little room all night.\" Then I thought about it, and I said, \"She works hard for the money...

The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company.

On the new episode of ‘Documenting Popular Music,’ journalist Robert Neil speaks with Platts and Lee from their studio in London about the new album and the retro sound that is starting to get a good deal of attention. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career.

Mercia dominated southern England, but its supremacy came to an end in 825 when it was decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun.

Under Alfred's rule, considerable administrative and military reforms were introduced, prompting lasting change in England. After ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting Viking invasions.

Mammals such as rabbits, hares, and some cat species are susceptible to bubonic plague, and typically die upon contraction. In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common.

Without treatment, plague results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Globally between 2010 and 2015 there were 3,248 documented cases, which resulted in 584 deaths. The countries with the greatest number of cases are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. The plague is considered the likely cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people, including about 25% to 60% of the European population. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor. The disease is also considered to have been responsible for the Plague of Justinian, originating in the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE, as well as the third epidemic, affecting China, Mongolia, and India, originating in the Yunnan Province in 1855. In very rare circumstances, as in septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. Rats were an amplifying factor to bubonic plague due to their common association with humans as well as the nature of their blood. Furthermore, in areas of a large population of rats, the animals can harbor low levels of the plague infection without causing human outbreaks. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague. The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. Other forms of the disease include septicemic plague and pneumonic plague in which the bacterium reproduces in the person's blood and lungs respectively. Blood Lungs Prevention Bubonic plague outbreaks are controlled by pest control and modern sanitation techniques. Furthermore, the plague most affected those of poor upbringing due to greater exposure, poor sanitation techniques and lack of a healthy immune system due to a poor diet. One example is the use of a machine called the Sulfurozador, used to deliver sulphur dioxide to eradicate the pest that spread the bubonic plague, in Buenos Aires, Argentina during the early 18th century. Another mean of prevention in large European cities was a city-wide quarantine to not only limit interaction with people who were infected, but also to limit the interaction with the infected rats. Treatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases. People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death.

The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others. The Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe. The Black Death migrated from Southern France to Spain, from Eastern France to the Holy Roman Empire, and to England by ship from Gascony. During the Black Death in France, King Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to compose the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic. The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.

Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.Death if it occurs is typically within ten days. The disease is most common in Africa. Plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor. Signs and symptoms The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. Because of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague. Treatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague.

People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics. History The first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence). The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. Second outbreak Main articles: Black Death and Second plague pandemic In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population. It is believed that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia, and this was proven correct as Chinese records showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another. There were many ethno-medical beliefs for avoiding the Black Death. The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague-infected animal.

One example is the use of a machine called the Sulfurozador, used to deliver sulphur dioxide to eradicate the pest that spread the bubonic plague, in Buenos Aires, Argentina during the early 18th century. Another mean of prevention in large European cities was a city-wide quarantine to not only limit interaction with people who were infected, but also to limit the interaction with the infected rats. Treatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases. People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics. The countries with the greatest number of cases are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. For over a decade since 2001, Zambia, India, Malawi, Algeria, China, Peru, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the most plague cases with over 1,100 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. Between 1900 and 2015, the United States had 1,036 human plague cases with an average of 9 cases per year. In 2015, 16 people in the Western\n\n  The Black Death was present in France between 1347 and 1352. The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others. The Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe. The Black Death migrated from Southern France to Spain, from Eastern France to the Holy Roman Empire, and to England by ship from Gascony. During the Black Death in France, King Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to compose the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic. The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal. In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.Death if it occurs is typically within ten days. The disease is most common in Africa. Plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor. Signs and symptoms The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. Because of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague. Treatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases. People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics. History The first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence). The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. Second outbreak Main articles: Black Death and Second plague pandemic In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population. It is believed that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia, and this was proven correct as Chinese records showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another. There were many ethno-medical beliefs for avoiding the Black Death. The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague-infected animal. Mammals such as rabbits, hares, and some cat species are susceptible to bubonic plague, and typically die upon contraction. In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. While vaccines against the plague have been developed, the World Health Organization recommends that only high-risk groups, such as certain laboratory personnel and health care workers, get inoculated. Without treatment, plague results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Globally between 2010 and 2015 there were 3,248 documented cases, which resulted in 584 deaths. The countries with the greatest number of cases are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. The plague is considered the likely cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people, including about 25% to 60% of the European population. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor. The disease is also considered to have been responsible for the Plague of Justinian, originating in the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE, as well as the third epidemic, affecting China, Mongolia, and India, originating in the Yunnan Province in 1855. In very rare circumstances, as in septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. Rats were an amplifying factor to bubonic plague due to their common association with humans as well as the nature of their blood. Furthermore, in areas of a large population of rats, the animals can harbor low levels of the plague infection without causing human outbreaks. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague. The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. Other forms of the disease include septicemic plague and pneumonic plague in which the bacterium reproduces in the person's blood and lungs respectively.

The massive loss of life caused by the plague led to a population decline, resulting in a shortage of labor and changes in social structures. With a significant reduction in population, there was a subsequent labor shortage which led to increased wages for those who survived. The widespread devastation caused by the Black Death altered people's perceptions of life, death, and religion. The plague's impact on society can be seen in the art, literature, and religious practices of the time. The plague had devastating effects, killing approximately two-thirds of those infected within days. Many times in history we have seen the devastation that a foreign germ can cause in a new population.The disease had originated in Asia, and the European populace had never been exposed to it before, so there was no level of immunity in the general public.First, the germ that caused this disease, Pasteurella pestis, was a new pathogen.Treatment today consists of antibiotics, which of course did not exist during the great plague of Black Death. At the peak of the epidemic, Paris lost 800 people a day. By 1349, half its population of 100,000 people had died.

In China, the Black Death also had significant consequences, with an estimated death toll of 13 million people. Similar to Europe, the disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the population. However, it is important to note that the Black Death did not solely affect Europe but caused high mortality rates in various regions around the world.

During this time, the plague swept over these regions and caused a significant impact on the population. It is estimated that approximately one-fourth to one-third of the population was killed by the plague during this period. Following the initial outbreak, periodic epidemics of the plague continued to decimate these populations for the next two-and-a-half centuries. The impact of the plague on the population was profound, leading to a significant reduction in the overall population of Europe and the Near East. These epidemics, along with the recurring outbreaks of the bubonic plague, further contributed to the devastation of the population. Overall, the bubonic plague had a major and lasting impact on the population of Europe and the Near East during the Renaissance and subsequent centuries. It caused a significant reduction in population and had profound social, economic, and cultural consequences for these regions.\n\n"

However, conservative commentator David Gratzer and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected healthcare performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.
