In the field of physics, Lorentz played a crucial role in the development of the classical theory of electromagnetism. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, Lorentz formulated the electron theory, which provided electromagnetism with its final form. This transformation preceded Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity and laid the foundation for it. Lorentz's contributions to theoretical physics were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. He played an influential role in promoting the new developments in physics through his involvement in the Solvay conferences as the chairman. Furthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time, expressed that Lorentz meant more to him personally than anyone else he had met in his life. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the \n\n Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. There is evidence from Einstein's writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.\n\nQuestion: who got the first nobel prize in physics\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In March 2019, Marvel Studios obtained the film rights to X-Men after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox. In October 2020, the films in the X-Men series, along with the Fantastic Four films, were rebranded as Marvel Legacy movies on Disney+. By then, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock \n\n trilogy, and that Tobey Maguire was in talks to return as his Peter Parker / Spider-Man from the latter films and Emma Stone was also expected to return as Gwen Stacy from The Amazing Spider-Man films. Discussing the return of actors from previous Spider-Man iterations, Newby felt a crossover-style film could \"lessen the impact\" of Sony's successful animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). It also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,  with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.

There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 to 10 metres); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band. This is called skywave or \"skip\" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 64 km (40 miles). Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. Therefore, they are used in point-to-point terrestrial communications links, limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 miles (48–64 km). They are also used for communication with spacecraft since the waves are not refracted (bent) when passing through the ionosphere like lower frequencies. However, unlike short-wave, this communication equipment is restricted by range (usually several miles, at most), but is relatively simple to operate and the main power source is usually provided by batteries. Additionally, many non-professionals may use unlicensed two-way radios, as is common with CB radio, Family Radio Service or PMR446. The usual method is that a ship calls a shore station, and the shore station's marine operator connects the caller to the public switched telephone network. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet. Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. The frequencies with the longest range are usually near 20 MHz, but the ionospheric weather (propagation) can dramatically change which frequencies work best.\n\nQuestion: which mode is used for short wave broadcast service\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. and particularly during the windy harmattan season, the city experiences a breezy \"dry heat\" that feels less warm than the \"cooler\" but more humid rainy season. As Kpassa is close to the equator, the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year.\n\nQuestion: the south west wind blows across nigeria between\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The player can use magically enhanced spores, pods, and rods to heal and strengthen themselves and their allies. There are three main classes of creations - Magical, who specialize in magical projectiles; Battle, who specialize in close combat; and Fire, who use a mix of projectiles and melee. Certain characters have special abilities. The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four. Player characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The key words here are fair and eventually – if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.\n\nQuestion: what does hp mean in war and order\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, the king issued the Cyrus cylinder, discovered in 1879 and seen by some today as the first human rights document. Proclaimed by the newly constructed United Nations, at the General Assembly in Paris on the 10th of December, 1948, the declaration signposted 30 key human rights that should be universally granted to every human. Although the Declaration is not legally binding in itself, subsequent international treaties, amendments to constitutions, and economic agreements affirm the declaration. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789; France), one of the fundamental documents of the French Revolution, defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people. ; The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1785; United States), written by Thomas Jefferson in 1779, was a document that asserted the right of man to form a personal relationship with God free from interference by the state. ; The United States Bill of Rights (1789–1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free \n\n significant attention to the event.

Eventual Super Bowl MVP Foles led the team in a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first league championship since 1960. Led by Nick Foles, the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41–33 in Super Bowl LII, the first Super Bowl win in franchise history. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win until the Phillies 2008 World Series win. The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987. After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.

Many of the songs are based on the ballet's dances. Most romantic and classical ballets of the 19th century were narrative ballets. Among the most well known are Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Narrative ballets are essential to a ballet company's repertoire, because they tend to generate the highest sales and bring families with children to see the ballet. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences. Moscow Ballet's current staging of the Great Russian Nutcracker follows Tchaikovsky's complete Nutcracker Suite score. Clara and her Prince travel to the Land Of Peace and Harmony instead of visiting the Sugar Plum Fairy, to fit the company's theme of international and cultural unity. \"It is the annual \n\n Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's popular 1892 ballet The Nutcracker is derived from E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's scenario, crafted by Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa after a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, is far simpler and less nuanced than Hoffmann's original story. Vsevolozhsky and Petipa entirely omitted the Nutcracker character's complex backstory, \"The Story of the Hard Nut,\" and expanded a short, satiric passage set in a Kingdom of Sweets to cover the whole of Act II. The ballet's scenario also introduced smaller changes, such as changing the heroine's name from Marie to Clara.\n\nQuestion: swan lake the sleeping beauty and the nutcracker are three famous ballets by\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Horticultural therapy programming at Craig has two approaches: leisure and therapeutic. This unique partnership with the citizens of Northeast Park Hill brings together a vast array of services to promote health and well-being across the lifespan. Outdoors, our green spaces include an urban farm, children’s farm, aquaponics greenhouse, horticultural therapy garden, and native pollinator garden. The Denver Botanic Gardens at York Street presents a wide range of gardens and collections on 24 acres that illustrate an ever-widening diversity of plants from all corners of the world. Distinctive gardens define and celebrate a Western identity and a unique high altitude climate and geography. Many of the innovative gardens are models of drought-tolerance and showcase native and adapted plants that thrive in Western gardens. Throughout the Gardens, the time-honored traditions of European horticulture merge with a dynamic diversity of plants and design that represent the best in horticultural achievement. The Sensory Garden at DBG is a unique garden which utilizes architectural features and sensory plantings to enable people of all ages and abilities to interact with plants.

The farm occupies space that was once a tennis court and basketball court as well as a field that was once used as an unpaved parking lot. EarthLinks cultivates transformation and self-worth with people experiencing homelessness and poverty. The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, \"I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities\". The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new \n\n of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low, but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested. Houses were open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The village was to be a demonstration of good practice. The Trust Deed \n\n Garden city movement was embodied by Ebenezer Howard, as this urban trends took off in the second half of the 19th century. The concept of garden city assumed the construction of urban bodies located around a kernel harbouring a public recreational green area, with rings of housing estates made of small plots of single-family houses, outer rings hosting public utility buildings and further out production plants. Howard's idea was especially described in his book Garden Cities of To-morrow published in 1902. Though the first garden city was located in England (Letchworth-1903), soon other instances appeared in Poland: Ząbki near Warsaw (1912), Podkowa Leśna \n\n pub.

The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time. The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye. The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished. The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre). Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away. - Robert Hooke According to Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of natural selection, features such as coloration evolved by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage. In his Origin of Species, Darwin wrote: \"When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the \n\n When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. In the middle of the retina is the fovea, which contains a high concentration of cones. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light. When a central image is projected directly \n\n example resulting in small or incomplete (but still existing) eyes, and eyes can be present in the earliest life stages but degenerated by the adult stage. The cornea acts as the lens of the camera, while the pupillary diameter functions like the aperture. It has a layer of photoreceptors within its protective casing, which respond to light. The lens system of the eye helps to focus light onto these photoreceptors. This process is known as accommodation. The retina is intricate in its organization. It contains a layer of photoreceptor cells known as rods and cones. The electrical responses produced by rods and cones are crucial in vision. The signals travel from the retina to the optic nerve, then to the optic chiasm, where fibers from each eye cross over. From there, visual information is transmitted to the thalamus and then to the visual cortex in the brain. These two processes are essential for optimal vision. It is a complex process that allows us to perceive and differentiate between different colors. However, the eye is far more sophisticated than a camera, with intricate structures and processes involved in the complex process of vision.\n\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1866, a group known as The Oak Island Eldorado Company or more commonly The Halifax Company was formed to find the treasure. By this time, there were many shafts, bore holes, and tunnels under Oak Island made by previous treasure hunters. When a plan to shut off the alleged flood tunnels from Smith's Cove didn't work, the company decided to shift focus to the original main shaft. The shaft later collapsed, and the \n\n Oak Island Mystery refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects found on or near Oak Island in Nova Scotia. Since the 18th century, a number of attempts have been made to locate treasure and artifacts. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. \"The curse\" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found. The island was the subject of an episode of In Search of... which was first broadcast on January 18, 1979. In 1983, Triton Alliance sued Frederick Nolan over the ownership of seven lots on the island and its causeway access.

Dissolution of gallstones is slow and can take months or years of treatment. Gallstones in the gall bladder is caused by bile that has high cholesterol content, too much bilirubin or too little bile salt content, and as a result the cholesterol forms crystals in the gall bladder and eventually turn into gallstones. Bile passes through the bile duct into the gall bladder where it is stored, until it is released into the small intestine when food is ingested, to aid the digestion of fat in the diet by dispersing cholesterol into small droplets or micelles so that it can be metabolised more easily. **\n\n#### THE PANCREAS\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe pancreas has a head, an uncinate process (a U-shaped protuberance), a neck and a tail.It receives 80 per cent deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen via the portal vein and 20 per cent oxygenated blood via the hepatic artery. Within the liver lobes, deoxygenated blood flows through spaces called sinusoids. The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat. Food entering the stomach stimulates the production of the chemical cholecystokinin, which causes the gall bladder to release bile into the small intestine through a sphincter known as the ampulla of Vater. **3-SECOND INCISION**\n\nThe liver is the body's largest gland; it removes toxicants, produces bile to assist digestion and breaks down red blood cells. The gall bladder stores bile for use by the small intestine. **3-MINUTE DISSECTION**\n\nAs the main site for detoxification of substances from the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is vulnerable to damage. The gall bladder not only stores bile but also absorbs water from it and, as a result, the bile becomes more concentrated and more powerful at breaking down fats. **RELATED TOPICS**\n\nTHE SMALL INTESTINE\n\nTHE PANCREAS\n\n**3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY**\n\nABRAHAM VATER\n\n**1684–1751**\n\nThe discoverer in 1720 of the ampulla of Vater\n\n**30-SECOND TEXT**\n\nClaire France Smith\n\n**_Bile produced by the gall bladder may crystallize and cause inflammation or blockages that require the organ's removal in a cholecystectomy_. **\n\n#### THE PANCREAS\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe pancreas has a head, an uncinate process (a U-shaped protuberance), a neck and a tail.The head nestles into the duodenum, the C-shaped first section of the small intestine.The pancreas is a lobulated gland (one with many lobules or small sections of tissue) and its cells are divided into two functional groups: exocrine and endocrine cells.The exocrine cells secrete enzymes that aid food digestion. The gall bladder serves as a storage organ for bile, a fluid produced by the liver. It is located near the liver and has three portions: the fundus, body, and neck. The neck of the gall bladder connects with the liver via the hepatic duct. When stimulated, the gall bladder releases its secretion, which is bile, into the small intestine through the common bile duct. The gall bladder is lined with a simple columnar epithelial tissue, and its walls are composed of three visible coats: an internal mucous and muscular coat, a middle connective tissue layer, and an outermost serous membrane. The main function of the gall bladder is to store and concentrate bile. Bile, produced by the hepatocytes in the liver, is transported to the gall bladder for temporary storage. While in the gall bladder, the bile undergoes concentration until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. During a fatty meal, the gall bladder contracts to release bile into the small intestine to emulsify fats and neutralize the acids in the partially-digested food. However, it is important to note that the formation of gallstones is a common issue associated with the gall bladder due to its high cholesterol content. In some cases, when gallstones cause complications or persistent symptoms, a surgical procedure called cholecystectomy may be necessary to remove the gall bladder. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat.The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver.The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder.Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.In humans the caecum is about 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length, but in animals the caecum/appendix can be very long; for example, in horses it can measure up to 1 metre (3 feet 4 inches) and contains enzymes for processing grass-based food. **\n\n#### THE LIVER & GALL BLADDER\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm.

These were the first truly modern coins; the mass-production of coinage with steam driven machinery organised in factories enabled the achievement of standardized dimensions and uniform weight and roundness, something no counterfeiter of the day could hope to achieve. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers. The high-technology of Soho Mint gained increasing and somewhat unwelcome attention: rivals attempted industrial espionage, while lobbying \n\n The Coinage Act of 1792 (also known as the Mint Act; officially: An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States), passed by the United States Congress on April 2, 1792, created the United States dollar as the country's standard unit of money, established the United States Mint, and regulated the coinage of the United States. This act established the silver dollar as the unit of money in the United States, declared it to be lawful tender, and created a decimal system for U.S. currency. By the Act, the Mint was to be situated at the seat of government of \n\n The United States Mint has issued legal tender coins every year from 1792 to the present. From 1934 to the present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar. Gold and silver coins have been previously minted for general circulation from the 18th to the 20th centuries. The last gold coins were minted in 1933. The last 90% silver coins were minted in 1964, and the last 40% silver half dollar was minted in 1970. The United States Mint currently produces circulating coins at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints, and commemorative and proof coins for collectors at the San Francisco and West Point Mints. Mint mark conventions for these and for past mint branches are discussed in Coins of the United States dollar.

Raw gold dust was used as currency in The Dalles because gold had to be shipped to the San Francisco Mint for processing. Demand grew for a mint closer to the mines. Senator James W. Nesmith introduced an unsuccessful bill in 1862 to create a mint in Portland, Oregon. On July 4, 1864, Congress passed a bill to authorize a new branch of the mint at The Dalles (then known as Dalles City) for minting\n\nQuestion: who is the current director of the us mint\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By systematically studying the leaching process under various conditions, the energy barrier during leaching was calculated to be 11.77 kJ/mol. The precipitate obtained from this process can be used to regenerate high-purity LCO. The recycled LCO materials exhibit comparable electrochemical performance to commercial LCO. This design strategy holds both scientific and technological importance in the field of hydrometallurgical recycling of LIBs. LiFePO4 is a 3.6 V lithium-ion battery cathode initially reported by John Goodenough and is structurally related to the mineral olivine and consists of a three dimensional lattice of an [FePO4] framework surrounding a lithium cation. Although the iron analogue is the most commercial owing to its stability, the same composition exists for nickel, manganese, and cobalt although the observed high cell charging voltages and synthetic challenges for these materials make them viable but more difficult to commercialize. While the material has good \n\n conductivity it possesses poor intrinsic electronic conductivity. The cathode comprises particles of sulfur \"redox center\", carbon, and electrolyte. During discharge, the lithium ions plate the cathode with lithium metal and the sulfur is not reduced unless irreversible deep discharge occurs. The thickened cathode is a compact way to store the used lithium. The design also allows the substitution of sodium for lithium minimizing lithium environmental issues. The usable charge storage capacity of NCA is about 180 to 200 mAh/g. However, the capacity of NCA is significantly higher than that of alternative materials such as lithium cobalt oxide LiCoO2 with 148 mAh/g, lithium iron phosphate LiFePO4 with 165 mAh/g and NMC 333 LiNi0,33Mn0,33Co0,33O2 with 170 mAh/g. Disadvantages are the high costs and the limited resources of cobalt and nickel. It is estimated that the NCA battery of Model 3 contains between 4.5 and 9.5 kg of cobalt and 11.6 kg of lithium. Lithium nickel oxide LiNiO2, which is closely related to NCA, or nickel oxide NiO2 itself, cannot yet be used as a battery material because they are mechanically unstable, shows a rapid loss of capacity and have safety issues.\n\nQuestion: what is the main mineral in lithium batteries\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the Basic Law, most fundamental rights are guaranteed in the first section of the same name (Articles 1 to 19). In cases where a federal or state law or public ordinance is alleged to be in violation of these fundamental rights, the Basic Law provides the constitutional complaint with an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court (Article 93 paragraph 1 No. These fundamental rights cannot be removed from the constitution, and no constitutional amendment may 'affect their essence'. Where an article establishing a fundamental right has been amended—as for example where Article 3 was extended to ban discrimination on grounds of disability—these subsequent amendments will not be protected from removal. The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional.

The malted barley comes from Great Western Malting in Pocatello, Idaho and their hops come from Washington. Powdery Mildew, Downy Mildew, Spider mites, and hop aphids are among many pests that negatively impact hop growth and output. Fungicide use is the most common treatment by hop growers, with plants receiving on average 8.3 applications per season. The nonprofit trade group Hop Growers of America is an advocate for Integrated Pest Management practices in hop farming. IPM in hop growing involves using a scientifically informed rotation of pesticides, growing a diverse variety of disease resistant cultivars, and practicing proper planting techniques to ensure minimal environmental and economic impact. Idaho, Oregon, and Washington all have laws preventing importation of hop roots from outside of the Pacific Northwest in order to prevent the spread of disease and pests. In the context of beer production, hops are commonly used to provide bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Some popular hop varieties used in brewing include 'Cascade', 'Centennial', 'Willmette', 'Chinook', 'Amarillo', 'Golding', and 'Saaz'. Apart from their role in brewing, hops have also been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. Hops possess properties that can regulate and balance hormonal activity, which may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. In terms of the growth and cultivation of hops, they are hardy perennials in zones 3 and above. It's important to note that hops plants are aggressive vines that can grow over 5 meters (16 feet) and necessitate time-consuming pruning and staking. The vine dies in winter, but the rhizomes (roots) survive, allowing hops to grow on new wood every year. I hope this information provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the common uses and effects of hops, as well as the specifics of their growth and cultivation.\n\nQuestion: where do they grow hops in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mitsubishi's Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the South Sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton and Palau. The original Japanese cultured pearls, known as akoya pearls, are produced by a species of small pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, which is no bigger than 6 to 8 cm in size, hence akoya pearls larger than 10 mm in diameter are extremely rare and highly priced. Today, a hybrid mollusk is used in both Japan and China in the production of akoya pearls. South Sea and Tahitian pearl oysters, as Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera, respectively, which survive the subsequent surgery to remove the finished pearl, are often implanted with a new, larger bead as part of the same procedure, and then returned to the water for another 2–3 years of growth. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical, nucleation bead. The most valuable baroque pearls are the South Sea and the Tahitian pearls, which are produced by Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped oysters) and Pinctada maxima (gold-lipped and white-lipped oysters). Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, which, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters, whereas Tahiti is the number one cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters. This species is commonly farmed and harvested for pearls, and there is general consensus that the quality of pearls from Pinctada margaritifera is the highest quality out of all the pearl oysters. The benthic ecology of the region is a significant factor in the rate of production and the quality of pearls. Stronger currents cause faster but lower quality pearl development.\n\nQuestion: in which sea pearl is found in india\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 Tcuft of proven natural-gas reserves. It also ranks 16th in oil reserves. Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%.

Since becoming her biggest hit in multiple countries, the song has often been recognised as Dido's signature song. Decca primarily put this fault on the group's keyboardist Rod Argent and bassist Chris White, who composed virtually all of the group's music. According to Decca, their own compositions were \"too uncommercial\", including \"I Want You Back Again\", which Decca cited among their least commercial singles. The release of \"Goin' Out Of My Head\" was a highlight in the Zombies career, as they'd gotten incredibly popular in the Philippines. In hearing this, Decca, who had been keeping \"Goin' Out Of My Head\" in their vaults for around half a year, decided to release it. So on 17 March 1967, \"Goin' Out Of My Head\" was released in the UK. It was backed by \"She Does Everything For Me\", which was a song \n\n My Head sold over three million copies worldwide to become the world's second highest selling single in 2001. Her co-written single \"I Kissed a Girl\" by Katy Perry also hit No. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" also won Dennis an Ivor Novello Award as 2001's most performed composition. She won the same award in 2003 for \"Anything Is Possible\". In the USA, Dennis has received awards from Billboard, Grammy for compositions with Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears. Dennis co-wrote the Pop Idol theme (re-used for numerous international remakes of the show, including American Idol), and many Idol contestants have recorded her songs, including Will Young, Gareth Gates,\n\nQuestion: who wrote cant get you out of my head lyrics\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers – giving a single red rose meant \n\n In Gothic cathedrals and churches, where a rose is often found above the West Door, the most common subject of the stained glass that it contains is the Last Judgement, which by a long tradition is depicted either in mural or glass on the western wall of the building. When rose windows are used in the transept ends, then one of those windows is frequently \n\nThe Sufi master Jilani is known as \"the Rose of Baghdad\" and his order, the Qadiriyya, uses the rose as its symbol. ; Two prominent books aligned with Sufism are The Rose Garden by Saadi and Mahmud Shabistari's The Rose Garden of Secrets. In turn, the imagery of lover and beloved became a type of the Sufi mystic's quest for divine love, so that Ibn Arabi, for example, aligns the rose with the beloved's blushing cheek on the one hand and, on the other, with the divine names and attributes. Other well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include:\n\n  Holly, especially the variety found in Europe, is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn. The sharpness of the leaves help to recall the crown of thorns worn by Jesus; the red berries serve as a reminder of the drops of blood that were shed for salvation; and the shape of \n\n A devotional image enshrined at the Maria Rosenberg Church in Waldfischbach-Burgalben, Germany, holds an 1138 painting of Mary, featuring roses. She is the Queen of spiritual flowers; and therefore, is called the Rose, for the rose is called of all flowers the most beautiful. Roses have long been connected with Mary, the red rose symbolic of love, the white rose, of purity.\n\nQuestion: who is rose in the fall season 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" explores several themes and issues that are relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. However, Fitzgerald's portrayal of the American Dream in \"The Great Gatsby\" reveals its limitations and challenges the notion that it is equally accessible to everyone. Through characters like Jay Gatsby and the Buchanans, he critiques the emptiness and moral decay that can accompany the relentless pursuit of wealth and the superficiality of material possessions. Furthermore, \"The Great Gatsby\" delves into the complexities of love and desire. The novel examines the illusions and fantasies that can be constructed around love, particularly in relation to the character of Gatsby and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan. The novel also touches on themes of identity, loneliness, and the loss of innocence. Overall, \"The Great Gatsby\" is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes and issues relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. Finally, he hits bottom, but with a mis-interpreted line from The Great Gatsby, his enduring love for his unrequited love, and the good luck of getting a job from someone, he is able to turn himself \n\n An adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel about a talented young man from a poor background who strives to win the unattainable rich girl. Set on Long Island, the wealthy Daisy Buchanan falls in love with Jay Gatsby, an Army captain. Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, rents Gatsby's gate house for the summer. Gatsby hosts lavish parties and seeks to reconnect with Daisy. Although The Great Gatsby received a poor reception in the author's lifetime, it is now considered to be one of the greatest novels in American history. It is a prequel to The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's landmark 1925 novel. The Great Gatsbys U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain in the United States. Nick centers on the narrator of The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway, in the years before the events of Fitzgerald's novel. It follows Nick Carraway as a soldier in World War I, his detours in Paris, and his time in New Orleans before his move up to Long Island.\n\nQuestion: where does the story the great gatsby take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Their victory over the Oakland Raiders on November 26 extended their Thanksgiving winning streak to four in a row and also ended a three-game losing streak to the Raiders. The Cowboys earned a playoff spot on December 27 after beating the Washington Redskins 17–0. Brett Favre became the oldest player to start and win a playoff game, but also won his first postseason game in four against Dallas. This would be the Vikings' final win in a playoff game until (after) 2017. In 1992 Dallas set a team record for regular-season wins with a 13–3 mark. They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23–10. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first-round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. The Cowboys also had a fierce rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. The two teams played eight postseason games during this period, including two NFC championship games. As of 2021, the Cowboys lead the all-time regular season series 14–13, but the Rams lead the all-time playoff series 5–4, having recently defeated the Cowboys in the 2018 Divisional Round.

Tax exempt entity returns are due \n\n According to some estimates, about three percent of American taxpayers do not file tax returns at all. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, civil penalties for willful failure to timely file returns and willful failure to timely pay taxes are based on the amount of tax due; thus, if no tax is owed, no penalties are due. A minimum penalty of $435 may apply for returns over 60 days late. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay Tax: If a taxpayer fails to pay the balance due shown \n\n Certain types of returns, called \"information returns,\" do not require payment of tax. The current maximum penalty for these forms is $50. Similar penalties may apply to an income tax return (Form 1120S) for an S corporation.

If a taxpayer discovers an error on a return, or determines that tax for a year should be different, the taxpayer should file an amended return.

She believes this is all due to the toxins being dumped there from chemo drugs. She prescribed iron for my low red blood cell count which is quite low (explaining my extreme fatigue), within borderline need of a shot to boost them. They inject radioactive material through a vein, then I have to wait 3 hours, return for the test/scan….my friend will come along with me. Your prayers have encouraged me as I begin to feel lighter, less fatigued and more hopeful. It’s now been more than two weeks since my last chemo treatment and I am still very tired and weak, more so than with the first two cycles. A urinary track infection completed the list of irritants but was quickly treated. This has just dragged on a long time now. She had me go for x-rays of chest and rig cage and ordered blood work , all of which we are still waiting on the results of. So in the meantime I am trying to take it easy, but still have things to get done (like car repair estimates after having been rear ended on Tuesday afternoon by a loaded dump truck – thankfully while we were both at a stop light), banking, shopping, etc. UPDATE: I spoke with the oncologist on call late today and she wants me to come in in the morning. The radiologist recommends a bone scan and she wants to see me since my liver functions came back elevated. The doctor warned us these infusions would be cumulative, meaning, they add up and go longer, deeper, wider, heavier than the previous – and he was right. The nausea and back ache have been continuous, managed by medications (which make me very draggy so my doctor is putting me in for a different type which I can pick up today) , but this extreme fatiuged feeling – there is no pill for, but “time”. Passing the time. And this week, that’s been lots of time. In the meantime I watch my world go on all around me and try to step into it, but soon have to give up. Last night I was so tired at 9 o’clock, managed to stay up until nearly 10, and Tim said “Why are you so tired?” I had to laugh and say, “Well, I drove to the post office,, dropped my mail in the slot, I ate lunch and sat at a table and all of that just about did me in!” Just that little effort took it outa me! Nevermind all of the other things that need to be done and have to wait! Kelli woke us in the middle of the night with the flu. She is home sick from school now and I am keeping my distance. Tomorrow night is a benefit concert at her school for one of her fellow students injured in a tragic car accident last month. Kelli is part of a singing quartet and does NOT want to miss it. She keeps asking if she’ll be well enough to perform. Even after a dark night. I’m grateful we can count on at least that! Each chemo round has had its own personality, it seems. My family has managed to move along quite fine with me out of commission. A knock at the door last night and I found this lovely arrangement just sitting on the front porch with a note from “Friends”. Here I am day after chemo on Thursday – Kelli likes my wig styled this way. Thank you again for all the prayers as I go through the weekend, typically when my fatigue and lack of energy set in.

Spina Bifida is the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United States. This is called the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP screening test). This is also called a sonogram and can show signs of Spina Bifida such as the open spine. There are three different types of Spina Bifida – Spina Bifida Occulta, Meningocele, and Myelomeningocele (Meningomyelocele), also called Spina Bifida Cystica. It is often called “hidden Spina Bifida” because about 15 percent of healthy people have it and do not know it. Tethered cord can be an insidious complication that requires investigation by a neurosurgeon. his is the most severe form of Spina Bifida. This happens because fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord is unable to drain like it should. Without treatment, a person’s head grows too big, and may have brain damage. Children who do not have Spina Bifida can also have this problem, so parents need to check with a doctor. A surgery is done to close the opening immediately after birth. Almost always, a shunt is surgically placed to help fluid drain properly. As the child gets older, these problems translate into physical disability, as well as dyslexia and other kinds of intellectual difficulties. Though she uses a wheelchair now, like me, she didn’t always. She used to get around well with the assistance of a walker, and she has always worn braces. I asked Kate to share some of her own knowledge and experiences of Spina Bifida. It was much more personal and helpful than anything I was able to find on a website. Because it was her first pregnancy and she had nothing to compare it to. Now they test for it. I’ve apparently always like to prove people wrong. Tell me I can’t do something and I will do everything in my power to prove you wrong. Big projects were hard because they require you to break them down into smaller parts and I never figured out how to do that. I always ended up scrambling at the last second to finish. I’ve had many situations where I was asked to do a list of things and only manage to remember one maybe two of the things I was supposed to do, and have to ask what else I was supposed to do. Or I spend so much time doing the first thing that there’s no time left for the rest. Talking to Kate and reading her answers, I found out so many things I had not known before, even through spending every day with her for years. Be careful, especially teachers, how you handle a child that doesn’t ‘fit in the mold’. Teachers can be a child’s greatest empowerers or their most destructive bulldozers. I started to get angry and frustrated, specifically about our school system, and how if you can’t cut it the way they lay it out, with reading and writing and math tests, you’re almost doomed for failure. That is where we have failed as a society. Do I know how to fix it? One person can’t change it. Again, I would leave what friends I had finally made, and be the new, awkward handicap kid that didn’t know anyone. That’s where I met Katie. Tired of not having any local friend, and honestly, tired of being shunned by snobs because I walked differently,\n\n lady lived. And, as there was seldom any one passing that way after dark, I felt quite retired and alone with God. I often \n\n in one lovely human being, of all my years of searching. Lilli had the mother complex too. But in the reverse ratio to mine. In her, the mother instinct was so powerful that she poured it out, indiscriminately almost, on everyone she knew. She mothers her own mother. Meeting Lilli was like coming home to an enchanted place one had always dreamed of, but never thought to reach. For her it was the same. She comes from a long family history of breast cancer with both her mother and older sister having been similarly diagnosed. She talks about the importance of getting second opinions and how that convinced her to have a lumpectomy followed by radiation versus a double mastectomy. Meg was lucky to have a strong network of friends and family that helped her through her journey. She now works for the Cancer Support Community to aid those less fortunate. Dr Williamson talks about why her medical career became focused on breast cancer following the loss of her sister to the disease. In her in-depth interview, she talks about the importance of radiation and how it significantly reduces the rate of recurrence for her patients. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's. My sister had breast cancer in her early 40's so I was a teenager when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I didn't know why she was going to the hospital. My parents didn't tell me and she had breast cancer. They told me that afternoon she had a single mastectomy. A year later she had a second mastectomy because the doctors back then said chances are if she had it on one side she's going to have it on the other so we're going to go and take the second one. And then a year later she had a hysterectomy and unfortunately for my mom she never really recovered from it all. But she was cancer-free for four or five years and then she had spinal cancer after that. The radiation zapped her spine so hard that she was handicapped the rest of her life and used crutches and a walker to get around and was never able to walk on her own again after the radiation. It had a huge impact on her emotionally, severe depression, and a really hard thing because none of us understood what was going on with her. None of us understood it. We thought once the cancer is over you should be fine but she had a really hard time coming out of it, never really did. I have a mammogram every six months and then I have a sonocine on the other six months and I've never missed an appointment and I never will. It 's just a range of all emotions and very confusing, lots of choices, lots of doctors to talk to, lots of questions, lots of answers, lots of opinions, so my choices were a lumpectomy with radiation or the mastectomy. I was told that my survival rates would be the same. I chose the lumpectomy followed by radiation, and actually the reason I made that choice was because another doctor had said to me, and it was the best advice I got, was just get the tumor out, just go ahead and schedule the lumpectomy, and then get to pathology, and then you can always go back and have the mastectomy afterwards. I followed this doctor's advice cause I was thinking I had to do either the lumpectomy or the mastectomy. And I did talk to every person I know who had breast cancer. I had a long phone conversation or lunch or dinner with every single one I had known who had it and what did they do; how did they make their choice; how did they make the decision; and I had a very good friend who had been diagnosed with the same kind of cancer I had just six months earlier, and she did the lumpectomy and radiation. That made perfect sense to me. I woke up from my surgery just sobbing hysterically, but I did wake up with my surgeon just holding my arm and rubbing my arm and just being there in my face, and she was really wonderful as I was sobbing. My husband was with me every step of the way. You go into the room, change your clothes…you take your clothes off, you put your robe on, you go in. It's all very clinical. And then they lay you down on the bed and then the radiation starts and it doesn't hurt. And I was pretty good leading up to the start of radiation in terms of emotion. She said, I didn't think you'd do well with this, and she was right. My husband got up with our children every morning to get them ready for school so I got to sleep in every morning which was great. I was glad it was over but it was okay. My doctors were wonderful. Every doctor was amazing. The mammogram lab was amazing. The breast center doctors were amazing.\n\nQuestion: who turned out to be the mother on how i met your mother\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Malaysia, the corporate tax rate is now capped at 25%. Nevertheless, a company eligible for a certain tax incentive might only pay an average effective tax rate of 7.5%, with only 30% of the company's profit being subjected to tax. There are a number of tax incentives given to entrepreneurs to encourage business growth and development. Therefore, many businesses have taken advantage of the various tax incentives available for their benefit. Good knowledge of these tax incentives has provided them ideas to effectively plan their business and investment strategies. As such companies have to seek expert opinions on all available tax incentives before they make their move to invest, because the incentives vary according to the business' structure. By revenue, property taxes represent 4.5% of total taxation in Australia. A government report in 1986 for Brisbane, Queensland advocated a land tax. The Henry Tax Review of 2010 commissioned by the federal government recommended that state governments replace stamp duty with land value tax.

They had ten children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Through his daughter Charlotte, Charles Louis Frederick is the ancestor of every British monarch beginning with George IV, who ascended the throne of the United Kingdom in 1820. Clarence House announced that, when Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall's husband Charles, Prince of Wales accedes to the throne of the United Kingdom, she will not use the legal style of queen consort.

Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels. Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization. In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.

Along this journey, if fertilization occurs, it usually happens within the ampulla or the widest part of the oviduct. The sperm's journey towards the egg is facilitated by several factors such as the release of cervical mucus that allows sperm to swim more easily and the contraction of the fallopian tube muscles, which help move the sperm towards the egg. This usually happens through a process known as the acrosome reaction, where enzymes released by the sperm help break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg. This is an essential step for successful fertilization since only mature eggs can be fertilized by sperm. Once fertilization occurs, the genetic material of the sperm combines with the genetic material of the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The oviduct provides the necessary environment for the sperm and egg to meet, allowing for the formation of a zygote and the beginning of pregnancy. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg. Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. ### **How Fertilization Occurs**\n\nThe process whereby sperm are prepared to fertilize an egg, which is known as _capacitation_ , takes place in two stages. First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. )The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg.Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation. The process by which a sperm fuses with the zona pellucida and completes capacitation involves several steps. First, as the sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, leading to the release of acrosomal enzymes. During this process, the heads of several sperm fuse with the zona pellucida. However, only one successful sperm will be able to penetrate the egg. This fusion of the sperm with the zona pellucida is known as the acrosome reaction, marking the completion of capacitation. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary changes in the sperm's plasma membrane, enabling the release of acrosomal enzymes. Upon penetration, the sperm sheds its body and tail, with only the head containing the genetic material entering the egg.\n\nQuestion: name the process of fusion of an egg with a sperm\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is a thin, highly vascularized, and pigmented layer that lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid supplies blood to the retina and helps nourish its cells with oxygen and nutrients. Lastly, there is the iris, which is the most anterior portion of the vascular layer. The iris also helps in protecting the internal structures of the eye. Overall, the components of the vascular layer of the eyeball work together to provide nourishment to the retina, regulate the amount of light entering the eye, facilitate accommodation for near vision, and maintain intraocular pressure. Vascular layer of the eyeball\\n\\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball consists of three continuous parts—the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris from posterior to anterior (Fig. It is a thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer consisting of smaller vessels adjacent to the retina and larger vessels more peripherally. Its components include the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes.\" The outer layer, called the corneoscleral coat or fibrous layer, consists of the sclera and cornea. The cornea, which is transparent, covers the anterior one-sixth of the eye and is continuous with the sclera. Moving inward, the middle layer is known as the vascular coat or uvea. The choroid is a highly vascular layer that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body, located behind the iris, is responsible for producing the aqueous humor and controlling the shape of the lens. The innermost layer is called the retina. It consists of the outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. In summary, the three concentric layers of the eye include the corneoscleral coat (consisting of the sclera and cornea), the vascular coat or uvea (composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris), and the retina (comprised of the outer pigment epithelium, inner neural retina, and ciliary body/iris epithelium). Reference:\n- The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats. The eyeball is composed of three structural layers: the corneoscleral coat, the outer or fibrous layer, the vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, and the retina, the inner layer. The external layer of the eyeball is composed of the sclera, which is the opaque tissue making up the \"white\" of the eye, and the transparent cornea located on the front of the eye. The sclera provides structural support and protection to the eyeball, while the cornea helps focus incoming light onto the retina. It contains many blood vessels that supply nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris and plays a role in secreting aqueous humor, which helps maintain the shape of the eye. The innermost layer of the eyeball is the retina. The retina also contains blood vessels and plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information to the optic nerve. The cornea is transparent and located at the front of the eye. The sclera, which is dull white in color, protects the internal structures of the eye and maintains the eye's shape. It consists of three parts: the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. The retina is the innermost layer of the eyeball. The wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric layers. Moving inward, the middle layer is called the vascular coat or uvea.

It is important to note that while bullet matching is valuable in forensic investigations, it is not a foolproof method. Primary and secondary markings on metal bullets serve as important identifiers for weapons. These markings, also known as \"tool marks,\" are created during the manufacturing process and can provide valuable information for forensic investigations and crime scene analysis. Primary markings are intentional, distinctive characteristics that are intentionally engraved or stamped onto a bullet during the manufacturing process. These markings can include the manufacturer's logo, brand name, or specific design features unique to a particular manufacturer. Primary markings help identify the firearm that fired the bullet and can narrow down the list of possible weapons used in a crime. These markings can include scratches, pits, or imperfections caused by the firearm's chamber, breech face, or extractor. By analyzing primary and secondary markings on a bullet, forensic experts can determine important information such as the make and model of the firearm used, its potential history, and potentially link it to a specific crime.

Sleeping sideways with the knees curled up (in the fetal position) is generally preferable. Alternatively, sleeping in a reclining chair or an adjustable bed elevates the head and knees, and so relieves pressure on the facet joints. With this condition, it may be preferable to sleep on the sides with the knees curled up (in the fetal position). A condition such as inflammation of the bursa over the hips (greater trochanteric bursitis) can be aggravated by pressure from a mattress that is too firm. If the mattress is too firm, a new mattress with thick padding on top—also called a pillow-top mattress—can reduce pressure on the hip. As a less expensive alternative, covering an older mattress with a new pillow-top can provide additional cushioning. The preferred sleep position depends in part on the position of the disc. Adjustable Bed. With this type of bed, the upper and lower portions of the bed can be raised and lowered in a customized fashion (typically powered by a remote control). There are many advantages to an adjustable bed, including the ability to easily raise and lower portions of the bed throughout the night. Adjustable beds are available at a variety of price points and designs. Reclining chair. A recliner allows the back to be supported and the legs to be elevated, but it does not typically provide the same level of customization as an adjustable bed. Reclining chairs are available with all kinds of coverings, including leather. Additionally, some reclining chairs have options such as heating, massage, and lift-assistance (helping one get up out of the chair). Wedge cushion. A large foam cushion in the shape of a wedge can be a less expensive alternative to either of the above. Moreover, purchasing a wedge cushion before buying either of the other options is a good way to determine if a more expensive option is worth the investment. Patients recovering from surgery—and anyone in need of extra cushioning—may benefit from adding a soft pillow-top to the bed as well. Recliners and adjustable beds not only make it easier for many people to sleep, they also make getting out of bed less of an ordeal. Adjustable beds and recliners may be rented from a medical supply retailer. 1. The bed has a safety feature which prevents rotation when the head is elevated above this angle. The Freedom Bed™, through its ability to provide frequent rotation, and complex positioning, addresses these conditions while improving comfort, independence, control, and quality of life. Thus the bed-user is carefully cradled by the bed’s structure to prevent sliding and shear forces that can increase the potential of developing pressure issues. The bed then automatically rotates to the other side to complete the cycle. 4. The bed can be programmed to stay in any of the positions (left, right or center) for a time period from 1 minute to 4 hours. This is commonly done by people who do not like, or are not able, to sleep flat on their backs, but prefer to turn from side to side. Enhancements to the basic model include a variable height (High-Low) platform, Trendelenburg positioning and a unique air-powered head and leg elevation system that provides extremely comfortable seating while reducing seating pressure. 7. 8. Does The Freedom Bed™ Sit Up? Note: ProBed offers a longer model (PAR3-A3FX) of the bed for tall persons over 6’1”. 9. numerous medical reasons for requiring Trendelenburg and/or Reverse Trendelenburg positioning and such requirements should be discussed with your medical professional. The turning function of the bed is not affected by the angle of Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg selected. Does The Freedom Bed™ Have Side Rails? Recognizing that many users of the Freedom Bed™ spend many extra hours in bed, the rails have been designed to provide an optimum viewing area around the user and to minimize any feelings of containment. The Freedom Bed™ has been designed with the user in mind and can best be described as “whisper quiet” when turning. It provides many years of safe, comfortable and reliable service to users. What Kind of Mattress Does The Freedom Bed™ Have? This will keep the mattress in its preferred position while the bed is in motion. Each of the three sections of the mattress has its own zipper.

Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the petit lever to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited.

Modern adjustable beds use electrical motors to control movement, and often include extras such as heat and massage. Adjustable beds have in some shape or form been available for many years. They have their roots in the hospital industry, which long ago discovered the many advantages of adjustable beds. It was not until the 1960's that these devices became popular for the general consumer, and since the price has dropped while the quality has risen. There are many medicinal advantages that are associated with adjustable beds. Adjustable beds have been shown to improve circulation, help to ease lower back pain and tension, improve breathing conditions, help with acid reflux, and have many other benefits. Many of these advantages come from the ability to easily put yourself in the semi-fowler position. Of all the medical benefits associated with adjustable beds, perhaps the most intriguing is its help with combating acid reflux. This is where the advantage of owning an adjustable bed comes in. By sleeping with your upper body slightly elevated acid reflux can often be controlled, and when this is combined with some of the medicines available for acid reflux, it provides a powerful means of preventing and controlling acid reflux. Adjustable beds offer many other advantages that revolve around individual comfort and usability. They make it much easier to watch TV or to read books in bed. It is also much more ergonomic and practical to eat in bed with an adjustable bed. Whether you are purchasing your adjustable bed for one of the many of the medical reasons, to get a better nights rest, or for any of the other advantages associated with them, you will be amazed at the luxurious feelings associated with these beds.

Recordings of \"Love of the Loved\" as the Beatles \n\n \"Love Never Felt So Good\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson, released posthumously on May 2, 2014. The song, reworked from a 1980 demo track originally composed by Jackson and Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka, was the first single released from Jackson's second posthumous album, Xscape. Its accompanying music video premiered on May 14, 2014 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. : Songs of Worship (2007) ; Pure Gospel: Top Gospel Choirs: Live In Praise & Worship (2006) \"Praise Is What I Do\" is a worship ballad from the Shekinah Glory Ministry's 2001 debut album and is sung by William Murphy. The song prominently features R&B singers Faith Evans and Kelly Price during the choruses and bridge. The video, directed by Kevin Bray, was nominated for Best R&B Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. First worked on as a demo, Jackson co-produced the song during a 1983 recording session with Anka. In 1984, Anka sent the song to Johnny Mathis, who recorded a new version of the song with revised lyrics by Anka and Kathleen Wakefield. In 2006, Jackson's demo leaked online. The first version, which only features Jackson, was produced by John McClain and Giorgio Tuinfort and was featured as the first track on the standard version of Xscape. The second version, featured as the last track on the deluxe version of the album, was co-produced by Timbaland and J-Roc and featured Timberlake in duet vocals with Jackson.

This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in On the Origin of Species in 1859. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories \n\n The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\" Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. One hundred years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor.

The series has accumulated a large international following and is well-received by critics. Principal photography took place over a period of two months between February and March 1973 in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, on a budget of $200,000. Producer Tom Karr, who had been fascinated with Ed Gein for many years, funded the film himself with income he had earned as a concert promoter for Led Zeppelin and Three Dog Night. Locations used included an abandoned farmhouse, a local hardware store, and a basement location in the hotel in which the cast and crew were lodging. The film's art director, Albert Fisher, dressed the sets with stacks of crime serials and pornographic magazines; Fisher garnered inspiration by reading newspaper stories about Ed Gein and his crimes. The Walking Dead is predominantly filmed in Georgia. The first season was shot primarily in Atlanta, but required a great deal of coordination with the city to shut down streets and parks for filming.

Sound waves travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates and transfers the vibrations to the small bones in the middle ear (hammer, anvil and stirrup) which send the vibrations into the inner ear. The vibrations are transferred into one of two parts of the inner ear, the Cochlea. The vibrations move microscopic, finely tuned sensory cells which send impulses to the brain where sound is interpreted. Sensorineural - A sensorineural hearing loss is a problem in the inner ear. It is permanent and can vary from mild to profound. In order to understand hearing loss, one must understand what “normal” hearing is. Loud speech is around 65dB HL, and sounds like a lawn mower is around 95 dB HL. We use the terms mild, moderate, severe and profound to describe the varying degrees of hearing loss. Severe – This is the level that most people think of when they think about hearing loss. None of the speech sounds are audible for a person with a severe hearing loss and they may require people to shout to be heard. Profound - Speech is mostly inaudible even with a hearing aid for an individual with a profound hearing loss. Amplified speech will not be clear and this person may benefit from a cochlear implant. Do voices seem soft or muffled? Do you have trouble hearing when it is noisy? Do you sometimes mishear or misunderstand what someone says to you? Do you have trouble hearing the telephone or doorbell ring? There is no signal “best hearing aid,” so what might work for one person might not work for another. Regardless, they all have a microphone, digital circuitry, amplifier, and battery. It also can reduce environmental sounds such as wind noise, without compromising the quality of speech sounds. Too many people know someone who bought a hearing aid, only to let it sit in their drawer. The Forest Grove Sound was an unexplained noise, described by The Oregonian as a \"mechanical scream\", heard in Forest Grove, Oregon in February 2016. In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in Forest Grove, Oregon. The Department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound. The news about the noise was first shared with Dave Nemeyer by a Forest Grove resident, who posted a video of it on the city's Facebook page. The Washington Post described the noise as sounding like a \"giant flute played off pitch\", car brakes, or a steam whistle. NBC News described it as \"akin to a bad one-note violin solo broadcast over a microphone with nonstop feedback\". It reportedly lasts \n\n can identify the type of source, which is done when the signals reach the cortex. A sound source produces a propagating sound wave that strikes the ear closer to it before traveling an extra distance to strike the opposite ear. If a sound impulse originates from a point equidistant to each ear (e.g. directly behind or in front of the head), the neuronal impulses from each ear will pass at a \n\n maybe 2.5 feet back and 5 feet apart you would have 2 more forming a triangle, omnidirectional microphones. Then we would have the [rear] two, the left and right [mics on the] tree, which would again be looking right into the first violins and the celli, if that was \n\nAt Medpark Hearing Center, we talk about treating your hearing as part of a larger system. Sometimes, just answering a few questions can help get the wheels turning, and highlight a few areas that might point to hearing loss. Does it seem like most people around you are mumbling? 3. Is it difficult to understand one person's speech while there is background noise? 4. Do you find it difficult to understand the dialogue on TV unless you turn the volume up high? 5. Do you often need to ask others to repeat themselves? Conductive is temporary - it means there's a medical condition causing you not to hear; the sound is not being conducted to reach your brain or the inside of your ear. If you hear gurgling, for example, that means there's fluid in the middle ear. It's like trying to run with three or four feet of water; obviously, your legs are not going to be able to move as fast. With ears, it's the same thing: if the ossicles in the middle ear are under water, they will not be able to conduct high frequency sound as efficiently. That's why everything sounds muffled when you have a cold. Sensorineural is permanent hearing loss. It means that the nerves in the inner ear have suffered actual damage, which could be caused by aging, ear infections, or prolonged exposure to loud noise. But we can treat it, and the sooner we treat it, the better. What does the brain have to do with the hearing system? Hearing involves more than just your ears. Your brain is responsible for interpreting sound, and just like the rest of your hearing system, your brain can be involved in hearing loss. Think about it this way: you can hear a foreign language spoken out loud, but if your brain doesn't understand that language, it will sound like noise to you. Understanding is the brain is part of the hearing system. If you go too long without being able to hear the world around you (due to conductive or sensorineural hearing loss), your brain may stop putting as much effort into understanding what you hear. If it gets out of the habit, then even hearing aids won't solve your ability to understand what people around you are saying. That's why it is so important to get hearing loss treated early, so your brain still retains all of its skill at understanding and interpreting sounds. Auditory deprivation can lead to brain atrophy. What are realistic expectations of hearing treatment? It can help you hear what the people you love are saying to you, and it can make it easier for you to get back into your favorite activities and hobbies. But it's also important that you understand what to expect. For some people, the answer is an old-fashioned device that is beige, bulky, and prone to squealing. In fact, it's a lot more likely that people you speak with will notice if you ask them to repeat themselves all the time. Hearing aids are also not likely to squeal, as long as you are wearing them properly. But it's important to stay on top of your hearing and address any problems as soon as you notice them to keep your brain healthy and give you peace-of-mind. If you have noticed that you're turning the volume of the TV up, if you're having to ask people to repeat themselves more often, if it seems like everyone around you is mumbling, it might be time to come have your hearing tested.\n\nQuestion: who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Compared to disposable sanitary napkins, cloth menstrual pads have a few advantages. In comparison to menstrual cups, cloth pads offer a different level of convenience and comfort. Menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina and collect blood internally, while cloth pads sit on the outside of the underwear and absorb blood externally. Some individuals may find cloth pads more comfortable or easier to use than inserting a cup. It is important to note that both cloth menstrual pads and disposable sanitary napkins require regular changing throughout the day to maintain hygiene and prevent leaks. Overall, choosing between cloth menstrual pads, disposable sanitary napkins, or menstrual cups is a personal preference based on factors such as cost, environmental impact, comfort, and ease of use. If a woman does not have menstrual pads available while menstruating, there are several alternatives she can consider. In addition, some women may choose to use period underwear or menstrual cups as alternatives to traditional menstrual pads. Period underwear is specially designed with built-in absorbent layers to prevent leaks, while menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood. Reference:\n- Menstrual pads: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_pad\n\n Menstrual product advertising began in the early twentieth century. Historically, menstrual product advertising has had to balance frankness and information with taboos and censorship laws against discussing or showing menstrual themes.

On August 4, 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared to Congress that, \"The United States must be neutral in fact, as well as in name, during these days that are to try men's souls. Wilson then asked Congress for \"a war to end all wars\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary. U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918. As U.S. President, it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the domestic economy ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France — funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on \n\n After the war began in 1914, the United States proclaimed a policy of neutrality despite President Woodrow Wilson's antipathies against Germany. Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned, believing that the President's protests against the German use of U-boat attacks conflicted with America's official commitment to neutrality.\n\nQuestion: when did united states enter world war i\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This includes investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and technology, among others. It allows countries to take advantage of their comparative advantages and access larger markets, leading to increased economic growth. This influx of revenue can lead to increased investment in infrastructure, public services, and other sectors, consequently creating jobs and generating income. It could lead to a deterioration in the terms of trade and negatively impact real income. This approach can reduce reliance on the gaming sector, making the economy more balanced and less susceptible to business cycles. By maintaining a balanced approach and leveraging the positive spillover effects, a gaming-dominant economy can achieve long-term stability and resilience. The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Proponents believe that a sustained period of low interest rates and excessive credit creation from fractional reserve banks result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment. According to \n\n weak, and through these loans money supply increases. However, inflation remains low because of either a pegged exchange rate or a supply shock, and thus the central bank does not tighten credit and money. Increasingly speculative loans are made as diminishing returns lead to reduced yields. Eventually inflation begins or the economy slows, and when asset prices decline, a bubble is pricked which encourages a macroeconomic bust. In 2006, William White argued that \"financial liberalization has increased the likelihood of boom-bust cycles of the Austrian sort\" and he has later argued the \"near complete dominance of Keynesian economics in the \n\nQatar has been successful in maximizing the benefits of its oil and gas resources through strategic investments and exports. The country has recognized the need to reduce its dependence on oil and gas and has made efforts to diversify its economy through the development of high value-added industries and sectors. These initiatives aim to create a more balanced and resilient economy that is less vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. While the country has been successful in maximizing the benefits of its natural resources, it has not yet fully developed the necessary capabilities for fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. This is a crucial aspect for long-term economic diversification, as it enables the creation of high value-added products, services, businesses, and industries. This can be done through investments in research and development, education and training programs, and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and government.\n\nQuestion: who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. Vodka, gin, baijiu, shōchū, soju, tequila, whiskey, brandy and rum are examples of distilled drinks. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth. By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. List of gin brands ; List of liqueurs ; List of rum producers ; List of tequilas ; List of vodkas ; List of whisky brands – also known as liquor and spirits, a distilled drink is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of a mixture produced from alcoholic fermentation, such as wine. The word \"alcohol\" is from the Arabic kohl (الكحل), a powder used as an eyeliner. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" authors for \"fine powder.\" Vigo wrote: \"the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for \n\n The inflammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE), Theophrastus (c. 371–287 BCE), and Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE). However, this did not immediately lead to the isolation of alcohol, even despite the development of more advanced distillation techniques in second- and third-century Roman Egypt.\n\nQuestion: where did the term spirits for alcohol come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While in Chambersburg, Brown posed as Dr. Isaac Smith, an iron mine developer, and bought, shipped, and stored weapons under the guise of mining equipment. Brown (using the name John Smith) and John Henry Kagi met with Frederick Douglass and Shields Green at an abandoned quarry outside of town to discuss the raid on August 19. According to Douglass's account, Brown described the planned raid in detail and Douglass advised him against it. Douglass also provided $10 from a supporter, and had helped Green – a future raider – locate Brown. On October 16, 1859, radical abolitionist John Brown led an attempt to start an armed slave revolt by seizing the U.S. Army arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). Brown and twenty-one followers, including whites (three of whom were Brown's sons) and Blacks (three free Blacks, one freedman, and one fugitive slave), planned to seize the armory and use weapons stored there to arm Black slaves in order to spark a general uprising by the slave population.\n\nQuestion: who led the soldiers in ending the raid on the harper 's ferry arsenal\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the summers of 1959–1967, female cast members dressed in mermaid costumes could be seen sun-bathing themselves and performing synchronized swimming and underwater stunts for four hours each day. Disney ended this feature in 1967 after several mermaid performers reported health concerns, related to the submarines' diesel exhaust fumes and the highly chlorinated water. In addition, tourists taking pictures of them would block the thoroughfare between the Matterhorn and the submarine lagoon. The mermaids received $1.65 an hour, which in 2018 dollars would be $13.15 an hour. In 2005, an auction took place at the Disneyland Resort, where several pieces of the original attraction's scenery were sold, such as the shark fighting with the octopus on a rock. They were removed from the lagoon prior to the auction so new scenery for the updated Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage could be built into the lagoon.

After this starting dose, all future doses of STELARA are given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). Make sure to discuss with your doctor when you will receive injections and to come in for all your scheduled follow-up appointments. Your healthcare provider may decide that it is right for you or your caregiver to learn how to inject STELARA under the skin (subcutaneously) yourself. If you would like to self-inject STELARA under your skin, you must be trained by a healthcare professional to prepare an injection and give it to yourself. If you have not been trained, please contact your healthcare provider to schedule a training session. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions about giving yourself an injection. Assemble the additional supplies you will need for your injection. Avoid, if possible, skin involved with psoriasis. If your caregiver is giving you the injection, they may use the upper arms or buttocks as well. Prepare the Injection Site. Wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab. DO NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. Gently pinch the cleaned skin between your thumb and index finger. When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin. Press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after the injection. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and hold for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary.

Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Insulin\nPerhaps the most common medication administered subcutaneously is insulin. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. Medication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. There is some low certainty evidence that administering the injection more slowly may decrease the pain from heparin injections, but not the risk of or extent of bruising. Subcutaneous heparin-based anticoagulation may also lead to necrosis of the surrounding skin or lesions, most commonly when injected in the abdomen. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Other subcutaneous vaccines, many of which are live vaccines including the MMR vaccine and the varicella vaccine, which may cause fever and rash, as well as a feeling of general malaise for a day or two following the vaccination. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. The specific needle size/length, as well as appropriateness of a device such as a pen or pump, is based on the characteristics of a person's skin layers. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise.

A subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin. In this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. This type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. Other methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body. Medications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections. Other drugs that need to be given very quickly can also be administered via subcutaneous injection. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously. Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. Before withdrawing medication from a vial and injecting yourself or someone else, make sure you’re using the correct medication, at the correct dose, at the correct time, and in the right manner. Use a new needle and syringe with every injection. If you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen. Dial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer. Dial the correct dose and prepare for your injection. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier. Inject the needle. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin. Insert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication. Withdraw the needle. Let go of the pinched skin and withdraw the needle. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row. For example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage. Learn about side effects, warnings, dosage, and more. What Is a Drug Allergy?

This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Other subcutaneous vaccines, many of which are live vaccines including the MMR vaccine and the varicella vaccine, which may cause fever and rash, as well as a feeling of general malaise for a day or two following the vaccination. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. The specific needle size/length, as well as appropriateness of a device such as a pen or pump, is based on the characteristics of a person's skin layers. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise. See also\n Intramuscular injection\n Intravenous injection\n Intradermal injection\n\nReferences\n\nDosage forms\nRoutes of administration\nInjection (medicine)\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Insulin\nPerhaps the most common medication administered subcutaneously is insulin. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. There may also be specific complications associated with the specific medication being administered. Medication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. There is some low certainty evidence that administering the injection more slowly may decrease the pain from heparin injections, but not the risk of or extent of bruising.

Saliva also contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of cooked starch. This movement is facilitated by peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions to propel the food throughout the GI tract. Here, further digestion takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes, bile from the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine itself. These enzymes break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The small intestine is where most absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to various organs and tissues for energy and other functions. In summary, digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract involve the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and elimination of waste in the large intestine. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus. Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. When food is ingested, it enters the digestive system where it is broken down into simpler particles through the process of digestion. The partially digested food, known as the bolus, then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. From the stomach, the chyme moves into the small intestine. It is responsible for breaking down food into its simplest forms, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. The nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream to various cells and tissues in the body for energy production and other functions. It is important to note that the absorption of digested food material occurs primarily in the small intestine, whereas the large intestine is involved in water reabsorption. The structures and organs involved in the digestive process, such as the stomach, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, each have specific roles in breaking down and absorbing food. Overall, the human body's ability to break down and absorb food is a complex process involving various organs, enzymes, and physiological mechanisms to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients for optimal function.\n\nQuestion: where are most nutrients absorbed in the human digestive tract\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot. Michigan is the fourth largest grape-growing state in America, with over 13,500 acres of vineyards. Much of the state's acreage is planted to varieties like Concord and Niagara, destined for juice production. Wine grapes represent 11% of total vineyard area. The 100,000 short tons of grapes produced in 2005, just 4,600 tons were used for wine-making. In 2005, the wine industry pressed 2,640 tons of European vinifera grapes, 1,660 tons of hybrid varieties, and 300 tons of American varieties. Michigan wine refers to any wine that is made in the state of Michigan in the United States. As of 2018, there were 3050 acre under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing 3 e6USgal of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA.

The Karthigai Deepam festival is celebrated during the day of the full moon between November and December, and a huge beacon is lit atop the hill. It can be seen from miles around, and symbolizes the Shiva lingam of fire joining the sky. The event is witnessed by three million pilgrims. On the day preceding each full moon, pilgrims circumnavigate the temple base and the Arunachala hills in a worship called Girivalam, a practice carried out by one million pilgrims yearly.

That is, it is formed from a minimal vertex series parallel graph by forgetting the orientation of each edge. The comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order is a cograph: the series and parallel composition operations of the partial order give rise to operations on the comparability graph that form the disjoint union of two subgraphs or that connect two subgraphs by all possible edges; these two operations are the basic operations from which cographs are defined. Conversely, every cograph is the comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order. If a partial order has a cograph as its comparability graph, then it must be a series-parallel partial order, because every other kind of partial order has an N suborder that would correspond to an induced four-vertex path in its comparability graph, and such paths are forbidden in cographs. A graph is simple if it has no self-loops and no multiple edges with the same endpoints. The number of maximal directed pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n &minus; 1)n.\n\n t and s are both endpoints of an edge of K, and if t is an edge in this cycle, it and s are both faces of a triangle of K. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere.

It impacts a marriage at all levels; friendship; fondness and admiration, intimacy, positivity, resolving conflict, repairing the relationship, how issues are raised, being open to the others’ thoughts and opinions, de-escalating and calming down, compromising, and creating lifelong dreams and meaning (Gottman, 2002). After a thorough assessment of each persons view of relationships in the above areas, a therapist can determine the issues a client brings to therapy that make marital interventions ineffective and develop solutions couple specific to reduce the impact of depression on treatment resistance to mariage therapy. Research (Gottman, 2009) shows men ages 55-65 are most likely to have affairs and women ages 40 – 45. Religion is NOT a protective factor in marriages with low marital satisfaction. Typically, 25 – 30% of marriages in counseling have been marked by an affair. Possiblly worst of all, the faithful partner now desires to flee the person who hurt them, however; needs comfort AND while the faithful person may desire to seek comfort from the unfaithful partner; they cannot. This may create a sense of disorganization, especially if the faithful partner has a trauma history from early caregiving they received or other betrayals from intimate partners. Initially, the person who had the affair must be willing to disclose all the details in answering the faithful partners’ questions, cut off all contact with the other person, and be willing to rebuild a different marriage. For the faithful partner, it means understanding this is a trauma and as such, Post Trauma Stress Disorder Symptoms are common such as intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares, numbing, hyper-arousal, anxiety, panicky feelings, and an inability to think about anything else. The faithful partner needs the freedom to express feelings, freedom to ask any questions and have them answered directly and honestly, and be wiling to rebuild a different marriage. The straying partner needs to be willing to be honest, open, and accepting. While not all marriages can survive the aftermath of infidelity, many survive and thrive; having a renewed friendship, increased awareness and ability to comfort each other, and deeper emotional intimacy.

Unhappiness in marriage often has a simple root cause: we speak different love languages, believes Dr. Gary Chapman. While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their “love tank.” Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like –hoping the feelings of affection will follow later– a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. “Love is a choice,” says Chapman. “And either partner can start the process today.” —Cindy Crosby. In the United States, half of all marriages do not end in divorce–despite the interference of hell-bent lawyers, biased therapists, the media, and even well-meaning friends. The Divorce Remedy aims to increase this percentage by offering seven clear steps that couples–or even one hopeful spouse–can implement privately. A therapist herself, relationship expert Michele Weiner Davis accurately (and often humorously) shows how typical counseling and communications tactics backfire. Her method for saving a marriage involves an effective blend of subtle and obvious action steps, each taken in specific order. After a myth-busting lecture on the realities of divorce, Weiner Davis thoroughly outlines her simple plan. Intimidating discussion topics and emotional letter writing are not required; as she succinctly puts it, “happiness is a do-it-yourself job.” Poignant questions help readers define their own needs, set specific marriage goals, and monitor results.\n\nQuestion: when does the little couples new season start\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Belgium, the justices of the peace (vredegerecht, justice de paix, friedensgericht) function as the small claims courts in the country's judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. In some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction, a magistrate, or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers. The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings.

When\n\nMy Sister's Keeper (2004) is the eleventh novel by the American author Jodi Picoult. It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. An injured Campbell approves the procedure and Kate's life is saved. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Characters Kate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. Jesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. Dr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist. Isobel \"Izzy\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. She is very close to her sister and as such despises Campbell for having left Julia. Taylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy.

Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. I wanted to respond to this huge need. I took care of her every day, making sure she could spend time with her family and be comfortable. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Just to give you an idea, in 2008 I followed thirteen families, while in 2017, more than 100. Definitely. It is devastating. It’s, I would say, one of the worst news you could receive. These families haven’t even seen their baby, so it’s very heartbreaking. There are so many issues. You give me hope, you give me life, I can finally talk about my baby.” The parents’ response is an experience of relief in every single case. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. What does it matter if you live eight minutes or eight years? The parents love this program. The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. We really make a point to emphasize that, yes, it’s going to be excruciating pain and that’s why we will be with them, but we promise that it’s also going to be a celebration of joy and honoring life. Invariably, parents will send us messages afterwards thanking us for the beautiful moment of celebration of the life of their babies.

The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. An injured Campbell approves the procedure and Kate's life is saved. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Characters Kate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. Jesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. Dr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist. Isobel \"Izzy\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. She is very close to her sister and as such despises Campbell for having left Julia. Taylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate. She becomes estranged from her mother after learning the truth, which is that Sara\n\nQuestion: who starred in the movie summer of 42\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, even though it never contained the element lead.

Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus, which houses the majority of their genetic material. This nucleus is delimited by a nuclear envelope that separates the DNA from the cytoplasm. In contrast, prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, and their genetic material is present as a single, circular DNA molecule located in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genomes consist of multiple linear DNA molecules and are associated with histone proteins, which aid in packaging and organizing the DNA. This contrast with prokaryotic genomes, which typically consist of a single circular DNA molecule and contain predominantly protein-coding genes. They possess membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, which enable various specialized functions. Eukaryotic cells are larger, more complex, and possess a membrane-bound nucleus and multiple linear DNA molecules. Their genomes are more extensive, containing both protein-coding and RNA genes. The DNA of an individual is the same in every somatic (nonreproductive) cell. Comparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate.

When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required. By binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. In biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process is known as phosphorylation, where the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group to the substrate molecule. Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis. The phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a protein, lipid or carbohydrate, can affect its activity, reactivity and its ability to bind other molecules. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP.\n\nQuestion: which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed \n\n days. It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near Acton, California, on the edge of the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Conditions were spartan, production hours long, and weather conditions at this 5700 foot elevation were extreme with constant strong winds and low temperatures. Nonetheless, director John Ford was satisfied with the crew's location work. For this location, filming took place near Goulding's Trading Post on the Utah border, about 25 miles from Kayenta. Anatopic incongruencies of landscape and vegetation are thus evident throughout the film, up to the closing scene of Ringo and Dallas departing Lordsburg, in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, by way of the unmistakable topography of Monument Valley's Colorado Plateau location. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup \n\n It was known as The Far West.

In order to show that she had neither lied about slavery nor exaggerated the plight of enslaved people, she compiled A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin. A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). First published in 1853 by Jewett, Proctor & Worthington, the book also provides insights into Stowe's own views on slavery. These terms infuriated Stowe, so \n\n novel was written, read, and debated as a political abolitionist tract.

It involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP. The pyruvate produced from glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it undergoes further processing in the Krebs cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the main pathway for ATP production. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain (ETC). As electrons pass through the ETC, energy is released and used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP by the enzyme ATP synthase. These metabolic pathways work in concert to efficiently produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the \"molecular unit of currency\" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by ATP \n\n A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.\n\nQuestion: where does the formation of atp take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. It is based on Petit's 2002 book, To Reach the Clouds, released in paperback with the title Man on Wire. The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest (and later release) of Petit, whose performance lasted for almost an hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments (with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present-day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man. Wise shares his stories of being wrongfully convicted in the Central Park jogger case (along with Raymond Santana Jr., Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Yusef Salaam) for the attack on Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old woman who was jogging in Central Park, as well as attacks on eight other people on the night of April 19, 1989. in various locations in the United States and Canada, and has presented his multimedia talk \"9/11 Blueprint for Truth – The Architecture of Destruction\" in 14 countries.

There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. Anatomy and physiology Upper motor neurons Upper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories. According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories: Somatic motor neurons Special visceral motor neurons General visceral motor neurons Somatic motor neurons Somatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. There are two types of beta motor neurons: Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate. In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle. All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, which is the cytoplasm. This process does not require extensive regulation and occurs in a simplified manner compared to eukaryotes. The RNA molecule produced, called messenger RNA (mRNA), is then immediately available for translation. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have their DNA enclosed in a nucleus, where transcription occurs. Transcription in eukaryotes requires the chromatin structure to change so that the DNA becomes accessible to RNA polymerase. Once the RNA molecule is transcribed, it undergoes additional processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns. This processed mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. The process of decoding the information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid until it reaches a stop codon, at which point the polypeptide chain is released. deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNAn  pyrophosphate + DNAn+1. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. This problem was overcome in the 1960s by the use of reticulocytes in vertebrates, which produce large quantities of mRNA that are highly enriched in RNA encoding alpha- and beta-globin (the two major protein chains of hemoglobin). They build long single-stranded polymers called by adding  one at a time in the -to- direction, relying on the  provided by the  strand to transcribe the nucleotide sequence faithfully. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is \"unzipped\" to expose the bases. The RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism.

Description: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.

Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. New Testament Parts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: and . Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed all who were present every single time. Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them. He heals the Capernaum official's son, heals a paralytic by the pool in Bethsaida, healing a man born blind, and resurrecting Lazarus of Bethany. Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: \"Do not tell anyone!\" The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree. In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord. The New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Apostles were holy men who had direct access to God and could channel his power to help and heal people. For example, Saint Peter healed a crippled man.

Soon the First Great Awakening stirred Protestants throughout America. Evangelical preachers emphasized personal salvation and piety more than ritual and tradition. Pamphlets and printed sermons crisscrossed the Atlantic, encouraging the revivalists. The Awakening resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to \n\n During the Second Great Awakening, Protestantism grew and took root in new areas, along with new Protestant denominations such as Adventism, the Restoration Movement, and groups such as Mormonism.

Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. New Testament Parts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: and . Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed all who were present every single time. Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them. He heals the Capernaum official's son, heals a paralytic by the pool in Bethsaida, healing a man born blind, and resurrecting Lazarus of Bethany. Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: \"Do not tell anyone!\" The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree. In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord. The New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Apostles were holy men who had direct access to God and could channel his power to help and heal people. For example, Saint Peter healed a crippled man. Early Christian church Accounts or references to healing appear in the writings of many Ante Nicene Fathers, although many of these mentions are very general and do not include specifics. It accepts \"that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science\", but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence. Faith healing is reported by Catholics as the result of intercessory\n\nQuestion: what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Toyota took the lessons it learned from NUMMI and went onto establish the wholly-owned Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plants in 1986. As Toyota prepared to open more plants in 1996, the company created the Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) subsidiary in Erlanger, Kentucky to oversee all Toyota manufacturing operations in North America. The merger of the sales and production organizations in 1982 produced Toyota Motor Corporation.

Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. He describes this as a \"private meeting\" (not a public council) and notes that Titus, who was Greek, wasn't pressured to be circumcised. Paul claims the \"pillars\" of the Church had no differences with him. Whether this was the same meeting as that described in Acts is not \n\n by Jewish Christians. Paul opposed the strict applications of Jewish customs for gentile converts, and argued with the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, where Paul met with the \"pillars of Jerusalem Church\" (whom Paul identifies as Peter, Jesus's brother James, and John) over whether gentile Christians need to keep the Jewish Law and be circumcised. He persuaded the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community. While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Paul was, before his conversion, an antagonist of the followers of Jesus.

The song's lyrics explicitly sum up the background of Eminem's character in 8 Mile, B-Rabbit, with the first verse summing up much of the plot of the movie. The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by B-Rabbit, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers. The song's production incorporates piano, drums, violins, and several other string instruments. The song is one of four new Eminem solo songs on the soundtrack, the other three being \"8 Mile\", \"Rabbit Run\" and \"Stimulate\" (included on deluxe edition only). Several critics cited this trio of songs as the best three from the soundtrack, as well as the most aggressive songs Eminem ever recorded.

Nintendo licensed the Mario characters but was otherwise not involved in the game's development, nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993. The SNES version used audio and visual assets from Super Mario World. In the United States, The Software Toolworks released a Macintosh version on CD-ROM and floppy disks in June 1994, under the title ''Mario Is Missing! The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, each of which became long-running Nintendo franchises. The NES was succeeded in 1990 by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed. Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984). The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by directing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything players need to \"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\", to be able to play more freely, so that it becomes \"their game\".\n\nQuestion: what was the first video game for nintendo\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The main reason for this is the presence of antibodies in the recipient's blood that can react with the antigens present on the donor's blood cells. It classifies blood into different types based on the presence or absence of antigens A and B on red blood cells. People with blood type A have A antigens, blood type B have B antigens, blood type AB have both A and B antigens, and blood type O have neither A nor B antigens. If a recipient receives blood that contains antigens that their body recognizes as foreign (not present in their own blood), their immune system will produce antibodies against these antigens. These antibodies can then cause a severe reaction when they encounter the foreign antigens in the transfused blood. For example, individuals with blood type A can receive blood from type A or type O donors. In summary, knowing the blood types of both the donor and the recipient is crucial in blood transfusions and organ transplants to prevent immune reactions that can have severe consequences, such as haemolytic reactions. Blood compatibility ensures a safer and more successful outcome for the recipient. A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type.The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.Some blood types are far more common than others.Conditions that permanently disqualify a person from donating blood include hepatitis B or C, heart disease, certain types of cancer (leukemia, lymphoma, and any type of cancer that has recurred after treatment or that has ever been treated with chemotherapy drugs), severe asthma, bleeding disorders, possible exposure to prion diseases (such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—see Overview of Prion Diseases), AIDS, and possible exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS) due to high-risk behaviors (see Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection). A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Some blood types are far more common than others. There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans according to a \n\nVIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.All blood donations are tested for infection with the organisms that cause viral hepatitis, AIDS, selected other viral disorders (such as West Nile virus), Chagas' disease, and syphilis.A person with AB-positive blood has red blood cells that have A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks do a test called a \"type and crossmatch\" on the donor's and the recipient's blood. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Generally, donors are not allowed to give blood more than once every 56 days. That is why health officials have restricted blood donor eligibility and made blood testing thorough. VIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.Hepatitis B remains the most common potentially serious disorder transmitted by blood transfusions, with a current risk of about 1 infection for every 137,000 units of blood transfused.AIDS\n\nIn the United States, donated blood is tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.\n\nQuestion: what is the most common blood type in sweden\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. \"Rehab\" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. \"Rehab\" became an international critical and commercial success, and has been referred to as Winehouse's signature song. It won three Grammy Awards at the 50th ceremony, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, such as Hot Chip, Lea Salonga, Seether, and the Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys. about a group of North Las Vegas undercover cops and their unorthodox methods working in a narcotics unit.

Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. President Obama advocated raising the minimum wage during February 2013: \"The President is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 in stages by the end of 2015 and index it to inflation thereafter, which would directly boost wages for 15 million workers and reduce poverty and inequality...A range of economic studies show that modestly raising the minimum wage increases earnings and reduces poverty without jeopardizing employment. The latter figure is similar to the proposal in the U.S. Congress, known as Minimum Wage Fairness Act. This amendment was defeated. The Economist wrote in December 2013: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest.

All building regulations made by the Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical fire resistance and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Note: building regulations and fire safety laws are different, but similar, in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)\n\nQuestion: when did the the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005 first come into effect\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He has released twenty studio albums, many of which feature his backing band the E Street Band. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length. Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle \n\n The song is a tribute to two anarchists of Italian origin, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were sentenced to death by a United States court in the 1920s for the murder of a payroll clerk and a guard. The consensus of critical opinion has since concluded that the ruling was influenced by bias against Sacco and Vanzetti's anarchist political beliefs rather than being based on any proof that they committed the robbery and murders of which they were accused. The lyrics for \"Here's to You\" make use of a statement attributed to Vanzetti by Philip D. Strong, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, who visited Vanzetti \n\nThe Balham Alligators ; Gary U.S. Bonds and Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen had originally recorded the song for his 1980 album, The River, but it was never released and he decided to re-record the song with Bonds for his 1981 album, Dedication) . ; The Flatlanders ; Joan Baez included a recording of the song on her 1970 album (I Live) One Day at a Time. The title of the song is referenced in Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1991 song \"Down at the Twist and Shout\" and Adam Carroll's 2000 song \"Errol's Song\". \"Somebody Have Mercy\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke, originally released in April 1962 on the album Twistin' the Night Away.\n\nQuestion: who wrote lord have mercy on the working man\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Clinical document audits are one way to assess clinical safety. This involves reviewing medical records and other relevant documents to identify any errors or deviations from standards of care. By scrutinizing these records, healthcare professionals can find areas for improvement and take necessary steps to prevent future errors. Healthcare professionals and patients can report any adverse events or incidents that occur during the course of patient care. These reports help identify potential safety issues and serve as valuable sources of information for improving patient safety in primary care settings. This method allows for the identification of any gaps in clinical practice and provides an opportunity for improvement. Direct observation of the clinical act involves experienced observers monitoring healthcare providers during patient encounters. This centralized information can help prevent errors related to miscommunication or incomplete information. These tools assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions, reducing the risk of medication errors, and improving overall patient safety. EMRs also allow for the implementation and monitoring of preventive measures, such as reminder systems for vaccinations or routine screenings. They facilitate better coordination of care among healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive appropriate follow-up and timely interventions. This report provided details about the incidence, causes, severity, associated disabilities, and prevalence of TBI, documenting that TBI is a significant public health issue. The US Congress passed the TBI Act Amendments of 2000, which required the CDC to report to Congress how best to measure the incidence and prevalence of mild TBI. This document described the significance of mild TBI from a public health perspective and offered recommendations for measuring the extent of the problem in the US. that provide funding for states to develop TBI infrastructure. o Provides counsel to state agencies involved in TBI services and advocates for additional TBI services. o Conducted to identify strengths as well as unmet needs in services offered for persons with TBI. o Up to 4 year grants to support development of State infrastructure. o By 2008, 47 states, 1 territory and the District of Columbia had received funding through this mechanism. o Since 2000, Protection and Advocacy agencies in each state are eligible for funds that can be used to benefit persons with TBI and their families. § Funding can be used for information and referral services, advocacy, and litigation services for individuals affected by TBI. § Since 2003, these funds have been distributed such that all states and territories receive some monies to support these activities. o The CDC also sponsors a help line that is staffed by Spanish-speaking operators: 1-800-444-6443. Primary Responsibility: To support research to help identify therapies and develop practice guidelines. o The publication of informational brochures on TBI. o Funding of clinical trials for interventions to improve functioning post-TBI. § See NINDS Patient Recruitment site for studies currently recruiting participants. · Passed during 104th Congress and signed into law by President Clinton on July 19, 1996. · Recognized TBI as a cause of disability. · Passed during the 106th Congress. · Title XIII of the bill established grants to be administered through HRSA TBI Program to support state TBI registries. · Mandates free public education with accommodations in the least restrictive environment for children with disabilities. o This can promote collaborations between schools and state vocational rehabilitation agencies. · Three titles of the Act provide safeguards against discrimination based on disability in the areas of employment, government services, and public and commercial facilities. · Importantly for individuals with TBI, the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with cognitive disabilities. · Amended in 1986 and 1992, this legislation supports the distribution of grants to state agencies providing vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities. o States receive funding based on population and per capita income. o Money is used for supported employment programs and for technology to improve lives of individuals with disabilities (i.e., for mobility, communication, computers, ADL aids). · In 1976, Congress removed this requirement to withhold funding from states without universal helmet laws. under the doctrine of the separation of powers. Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to interpret legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established. The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term legislation is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term primary legislation may be used to exclude these other forms. Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the future. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in digital formats, then lost track over time. Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in time capsules or other special storage environments. These roles move into the realm of practice usually reserved for physicians, such as diagnosing disease and prescribing medications and treatments. Many also have teaching responsibilities, especially in large medical centers. For example, nurse researchers might look at how staff mix or educational preparation affects patient outcomes. Flexibility is a key strength in their role, as constant innovations in practice and science drive education. You should have additional education in pedagogy (the art of teaching) to prepare yourself for this role. Their work is rarely performed on the direct clinical level but is typically focused more on systems issues such as staffing, quality of care and meeting regulatory requirements.

In this process, synapses occur only in the gray matter, which is where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located. Sensory neurons are classified as pseudounipolar neurons and have cell bodies located in ganglia along the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Reference: They have a single process that divides into a peripheral segment that brings information from the periphery to the cell body and a central segment that carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. Nuclei of the CNS are the morphologic and functional equivalents of the ganglia of the PNS. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located in the ventral (anterior) horn of the gray matter. Because the motor neuron conducts impulses away from the CNS, it is an efferent neuron. The axon of a motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, passes through the ventral (anterior) root, becomes a component of the spinal nerve of that segment, and as such is conveyed to the muscle. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in ganglia that lie on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipol. The sensory neurons within the DRG have specialized nerve endings in the skin, muscles, and other tissues that detect sensory stimuli. These stimuli are then converted into electrical signals that travel along the axons of the sensory neurons and enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Once inside the spinal cord, the sensory information is processed and integrated with other signals before being transmitted to the brain for further interpretation and perception. It houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons and serves as a relay station for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. These nerve fibers play a crucial role in transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body. On the other hand, the gray matter forms an inner butterfly-shaped pattern surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. It contains the cell bodies of neurons as well as nerve fibers. The sensory neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia. It is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels. In areas where the gray matter contains many large motor nerve cells that control limb movement, the gray matter and spinal cord are considerably larger compared to areas where the gray matter contains motor neurons for the muscles of the torso. Reference: A cross-section through the lower lumbar region of the spinal cord is shown here. These nerves are carried by sensory nerves and are responsible for transmitting sensory signals to the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system, afferent and efferent nerve fibers are part of the somatic nervous system and originate outside of the spinal cord. Afferent fibers are carried by sensory nerves into the spinal cord, while efferent fibers are carried by motor nerves out of the spinal cord to act on skeletal muscles. The cell bodies of afferent neurons are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, specifically in the dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. For example, certain afferent neurons called intrafusal muscle fibers function as stretch receptors by detecting changes in muscle length. One important pathway is the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which transmits sensations from the periphery via afferent nerve fibers. In summary, afferent nerve fibers serve the role of conveying sensory information from the sensory receptors to the brain.\n\nQuestion: where are unipolar neurons found in spinal cord\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. This organism is found in the mouths of about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact.

This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular skin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth.

Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. GI Physiology Carbohydrates Digestion and Absorption. It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\n In humans and other mammals, sucrose is broken down into its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, by sucrase or isomaltase glycoside hydrolases, which are located in the membrane of the microvilli lining the duodenum. In bacteria and some animals, sucrose is digested by the enzyme invertase. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion. To protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield.\n\nQuestion: in what part of the digestive tube do you expect the initial digestion of starch\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Researchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb. \"Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy,\" she told Reuters Health. At different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played. They found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds. Sucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics. Previous research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care. There were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music. They said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available. \"The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over,\" Loewy said. Loewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well. When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound. Listening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the 5th most unpleasant sound is that of nails scraping against a blackboard (listen). Listen to the sound of a ruler on a bottle, the 4th most unpleasant sound in the study. The 3rd most unpleasant sound is that of chalk on a blackboard (listen). The 2nd most unpleasant sound is that of a fork scraping against a glass (listen), according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the number one most unpleasant sound is that of a knife scraping against a bottle (listen). Long years ago, as earth lay dark and still, Rose a loud cry upon a lonely hill, While \n\n\"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.The sounds used in BioAcoustics are created by frequency generating and filtering equipment, which patients listen to either in a sound room or through headphones. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning\n\nFor nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. From the general practice nurse to the ICU nurse, lung sounds tell you a great deal about a patient and their relative health. For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition. What was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema. – Listening for lung sounds. Wheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Stridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction. A pericardial rub and a pleural rub will often sound similar, and the best way to distinguish between the two is to make the patient hold their breath. We are going to listen to the heart over the valves, and nothing more. Now, if you hear a murmur over the valve… we are getting somewhere. The mitral valve is relatively easy to find if you are used to taking an apical pulse. The first sound you hear in the cardiac cycle is the “lub,” and it is a sound full of meaning. It is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing as the body empties the ventricles into the lungs and body. It is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing. Occasionally, you may hear a “split” S2 that sounds like “du-dub.” This is the aortic valve closing slightly before the pulmonic valve and is often a normal sound heard on inspiration. To hear a ventricular gallop, or S3, you should listen over the mitral valve with the bell. It will sound like a weird plopping noise right after you hear the “dub.” The whole heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Kentucky’. This heart sound can indicate heart ischaemia or heart failure. However, it is a normal sound in young adults under 30. S4 is the heart sound for atrial gallop, and the heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Tennessee’. Listen over the mitral valve with the bell of the stethoscope. You will hear the plopping noise just before the “lub” starts, which means it happens right before systole starts. This heart sound can tell you quite a bit. It is heard after heart attacks, and can indicate aortic stenosis, ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension. They will often sound like the words “rush” or “hush” and can last throughout the heartbeat. Most nurses carry out a cursory listen for bowel sounds, but you may not realise how variable and important these sounds can be.\n\nQuestion: who sings stop listen what 's that sound\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition to imaging for therapy planning, there are a number of requirements in order to deliver a prescribed radiation dose to the patient with a sufficient control and accuracy. These relate to the technologies used to deliver the dose to the patient and the computerized calculational procedures that are required to optimize the treatment technique and to predict precisely the dose that will be given to the patient using complex radiation delivery technologies. The “leaves” in these “multileaf collimators” are motor-driven and computer-controlled and can project shadows at the level of the patient that are 0.5 or 1 cm in width. This process has become known as segmented field, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or when using moving leaves and a moving machine gantry, it is known as dynamic IMRT. The first implementation of this concept was performed by NOMOS Corporation and was provided as an add-on accessory to existing linear accelerators. The add-on feature consists of a set of multileaf collimators that provide a narrow “fan” beam shape (Figure 1) projecting a maximum width at the patient of about 20 cm. The fan beam thickness can be either 0.8 or 1.6 cm and each leaf projects a shadow of about 1 cm width at the patient. When the leaves are in the beam, that portion of the beam is fully shielded except for a minor (~0.5%) transmission component. Figure 1. (a) Schematic of a binary multileaf collimator with a fan beam geometry. This schematic example shows leaves that move from one side. (b) Picture of TomoTherapy single slice multileaf collimator the interdigitated leaves and how they move from both sides. Either the leaf is open or closed for that slice providing “binary” dose delivery, i.e., for that portion of the beam, the beam is either on or off. The open beam components are generally referred to as “beamlets” or “pencil beams”. After two simultaneous slices have been delivered, the patient is translated by two slice thicknesses and the next two slices are delivered until the total treatment volume is covered, hence the nomenclature, “serial tomotherapy”. Traditional linear accelerators are currently limited to serial tomotherapy due to the limited rotation possible (~370°) and the inability to move the couch smoothly and automatically during radiation delivery. Furthermore, serial tomotherapy is unable to image the patient in treatment position and, therefore, unable to assure the accurate placement of the high dose volume with respect to the malignant region. The new tomotherapy units are capable to remove these limitations. As can be seen in Figure 2, the helical tomotherapy machine is a combination of a helical CT scanner and a linear accelerator. Mounted on the rotating gantry and attached to the slip ring is a compact linear accelerator generating a 6 MV photon beam. Since it is a specially designed machine for helical, fan beam delivery, the multileaf collimation system is specifically designed to minimize leaf transmission and interleaf leakage – important considerations for narrow beam, multislice delivery procedures. Figure 3 is a schematic example of a “U”- shaped target that encompasses a critical normal tissue. Helical tomotherapy mounted on a ring gantry provides significant advantages over today’s state-of-the-art radiation treatment. The dose reconstruction capabilities provide an ability to determine the dose actually delivered to the patient, also on a daily basis. The ring-mounted helical tomotherapy concept combines state-of-the art imaging and treatment capabilities. Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a \n\n  The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints. The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement. This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed. Lever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power. However, in a study conducted during brief periods of microgravity, it was found that the elevated initial lifting effort in the large box was preserved. Despite the overall decrease in lifting speed, the mean initial acceleration of the box remained higher in the large box compared to the smaller one.\n\nQuestion: what is a real world application of an atwood machine\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the film Natural Born Killers (1994), Lineback's character, Sonny, was the first redneck to be shot to death by the murderous couple Mickey Knox (played by Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (played by Juliette Lewis). He played a FBI special agent, McMurphy, in the crime/thriller The Jackal (1997) with Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier. Lineback recreated his performance as Al LeFauve for the Showtime film The Baby Dance (1998) co-starring Stockard Channing and Laura Dern. He played the innkeeper in the horror film The Ring (2002) featuring Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. He then appeared in the Oliver Stone-directed Natural Born Killers (1994) alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr. For his performance as free-speech activist Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) \n\n Kalifornia is a 1993 American road thriller film directed by Dominic Sena, in his directorial debut. It stars Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, and Michelle Forbes.

Physiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. All muscles in the body are affected. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

The song was sung by the insurgents during the Easter Rising of 1916, but thereafter it fell out of favour. Just as the Irish Parliamentary Party and the green harp flag were eclipsed by Sinn Féin and the Irish tricolour, so \"God Save Ireland\" was eclipsed by \"The Soldiers' Song\", which was formally adopted in 1926 as the anthem of the Irish Free State created in 1922. England - \"God Save the Queen\" is usually presumed to be, and often played as, the English regional anthem; but \"Jerusalem\", \"I Vow To Thee, My Country\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" are also sung.

In addition to raising his workers' wages, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. Ford explained, \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.\" Society would have one third of its people working the red week, another third the blue week and the third the white week. Every day throughout the year there would be two groups working their four occupational days of the week and one resting for their two-day weekend. For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday.

A total of 33 half-hour episodes, each of which included three 7-minute shorts, were produced over three seasons, from 1980 to 1982 on ABC. Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season.

One of the negative impacts was that exclusive studies were not conducted on the benefits and harms before the introduction of the green revolution. This led to a loss of traditional and indigenous crop varieties, which are often more resilient to pests and diseases and have higher nutritional value. Furthermore, the green revolution promoted the use of high-yielding crop varieties, which require significant amounts of irrigation and inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This led to increased costs for farmers, creating a dependency on external inputs and technologies. Small-scale farmers, in particular, faced challenges in accessing these resources, which further increased inequalities in the agricultural sector. In summary, despite the initial success in reducing rural poverty, the post-green revolution period in developing countries like India had negative impacts on health outcomes.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album.

The song received moderate success, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Bout It is the second studio album by American singer Jesse Powell. It was released by Silas Records on September 8, 1998 in the United States. For sales in excess of 500,000 copies, Bout It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 8, 1999. Three singles were released from the album, including \"I Wasn't with It\", \"You\" and \"'Bout It, 'Bout It\". \"You\" is Powell's only hit to date on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 10 in 1999. \"It Won't Be Me\" is a song written by Tom Shapiro and Chris Waters, and recorded by American country music artist Tanya Tucker. It was released in October 1990 as the third single from the album Tennessee Woman. \"Me Too\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor for her second major-label studio album Thank You (2016). It was written by Trainor, Eric Frederic, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Jason Desrouleaux, Peter Svensson, and produced by Ricky Reed. The track was released on May 5, 2016, as the second single from the album. It received mixed to negative reviews, with some critics accusing Trainor of bragging. \"Me Too\" was a commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nQuestion: who sings the song it ai n 't me\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At higher doses, there may be slurred speech, trouble walking, and vomiting. Legally, alcohol intoxication is often defined as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of greater than 5.4–17.4 mmol/L (25–80 mg/dL or 0.025–0.080%). Acute intoxication has been documented throughout history, and alcohol remains one of the world's most widespread recreational drugs. As drinking increases, people become sleepy, or fall into a stupor. In addition to respiratory failure and accidents caused by effects on the central nervous system, alcohol causes significant metabolic derangements. Diagnosis Alcohol intoxication is described as a mental and behavioural disorder by the International Classification of Diseases. Clinical findings Hospital admissions Alcohol intoxication was found to be prevalent in clinical populations within\n\n Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their \n\n Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the United States, more than tobacco and illicit drugs. Although the purchase of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is illegal, people aged 12–20 years old drink 11% of all alcohol consumed in the US. Among the 14 million adults aged 21 or older who were classified as having alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year, more than 13 million had started using alcohol before age 21. Since 1984, when the National Minimum Drinking Age Act made the minimum legal drinking age for every state in the nation 21, there has been a steady increase in prevalence of alcohol use, heavy use, and frequent use among underage drinkers as the age increases. Across all ages, the highest rates for alcohol abuse occur among persons 19 years old due to illegality of their behavior, and peak alcohol dependence is age 22. In 2013, more than two-thirds of American students had consumed alcohol by the end of high school; and more than half of 12th graders had been drunk at least once in their lifetime. They feel that this contributes to their lower numbers of alcohol-related problems. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. In 1985, South Dakota challenged the NMDAA, but in 1987 the Supreme Court ruled the Act was constitutional for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, the Court indicated that the States still had the right to set \n\nThe reduction in underage drinking and drunken driving accidents among young people is widely viewed as one of the greatest public health achievements in the United States. But data suggest that among people who are middle age, another problem involving excess drinking has been quietly brewing. The problem is contributing to the alarming trend of white Americans dying younger than they used to. The rise was driven by drug overdoses and suicides, but also by alcohol poisoning, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. It has been observed only in the U.S. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who are spouses and Princeton University economists, have found that the trend began among people ages 45 to 54 in 1999 and continued through 2013, resulting in an increase of 134 deaths per 100,000 people. Congress poured funding into the effort and passed legislation to increase access to treatment. But when it comes to tackling alcohol misuse in middle age, the route for public health strategists has been less clear. Part of the dilemma is that, unlike opioids such as heroin, alcohol is a legal product that studies suggest can contribute to better heart health. Calls for restricting access to alcohol through taxes or other means can look a lot like Prohibition-era methods and can be damaging to the financial health of small businesses. Restrictions also can affect people who drink moderately. “There is a concerted effort among folks in the public health industry and in the government to demonize alcohol,” said Sarah Longwell, managing director of the American Beverage Institute, a trade group that represents restaurants. For instance, long-held beliefs about the benefits of moderate drinking are becoming muddled. Public health officials in other countries increasingly are warning that alcohol is a risk factor for cancer. While the latest U.S. dietary guidelines state moderate alcohol use can be part of a healthy diet, they no longer tie it to cardiovascular benefits. It cited taxes on alcohol, limiting where alcohol can be sold and how often, and reducing marketing and advertising. To the industry, these proposals represented an anti-alcohol approach that would affect people who drink moderately. Massachusetts has been cracking down on stores that sell alcohol for less than what they paid, and a bill introduced in Oregon would ban imbibing on beaches. Various members of the public health community believe that restrictions on alcohol are an important tool for reducing alcohol-related deaths. Thomas Babor, head of the Department of Community Medicine and Health Care at the University of Connecticut, who has conducted research on alcohol restrictions, argues that the laws don’t get in the way of moderate drinkers, but of impulse buyers. Yet advocates are concerned that a war on alcohol could actually make the problem worse, while creating disadvantages for casual drinkers. U.S. dietary guidelines still say that moderate drinking for those of legal drinking age means up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. “For those who choose to drink, moderate alcohol consumption can be incorporated into the calorie limits of most healthy eating patterns,” the guidelines say. But data suggest some Americans are struggling to follow these recommendations. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, an estimated 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes annually, making alcohol the fourth-leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. And some evidence suggests that alcohol-linked deaths are trending upward. For instance, a recent CDC report shows that such deaths among whites grew by 50 percent from 2005 to 2015 and by 28 percent overall. The deaths range from alcohol poisonings and injuries to chronic, long-term use. A 2015 report stunned researchers when it revealed that most alcohol poisoning deaths are concentrated among middle-aged white men, not college students, as they had expected. The vast majority of these deaths had no other known substance involved. County-by-county data compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that even though the percentage of people who drink alcohol has remained relatively unchanged, those who drink are more likely to be heavy drinkers and binge drinkers. The trend, they concluded, was driven largely by women. The data show that women saw a 17.5 percent rise from 2005 to 2012 in binge drinking, which is defined as at least four drinks on a single occasion, such as over dinner or at a party, at least once during the last month. For men, the rates increased by 4.9 percent during the same time period. But complicating the conversation around what approach to take is that experts admit the mortality and drinking data from various sources are imperfect. They noted as well that deaths were increasing primarily among people who have a high school degree or less education. The alcohol industry said these points underscore the need to address such deaths is more complicated than implementing restrictions. But those who advocate for restrictions say they can be effective at reducing drinking among those who struggle with misuse. The greater the availability of alcohol, they say, the more consumption will increase. David Jernigan, whose research at Johns Hopkins University has focused on alcohol policy, supports public health approaches toward alcohol that are similar to those that were used to combat tobacco. He cited the example of the United Kingdom, which has one of the highest rates of binge drinking in the world. Several studies and health officials in the United Kingdom attribute this to the deregulation of alcohol: It can be sold at any time of day, it is inexpensive, and it is sold in many places. But a United Kingdom analysis of the law that extended hours during which alcohol could be sold determined that findings were generally inconclusive, and government reports on drinking rates show a small decline in binge drinking in recent years as well as an increase in the proportion of people who don’t drink at all. How to deal with alcohol-related deaths remains a point of contention. Those who oppose restrictions and those who support them point to studies that bolster their arguments about effectiveness. In recent years, the U.S. largely has moved in the direction of loosening restrictions on alcohol, which many see as taking a more modernized approach.\n\nQuestion: when was the drinking age set to 21\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Helen North, a widowed handbag designer with 10 kids (four biological, six adopted), takes a more relaxed approach to life. Instantly rekindling their old sparks, Frank and Helen quickly decide to marry in a private ceremony, to the Beardsley and North kids' shock. The first half consists of a romantic comedy storyline involving an aerialist, played by Gene Kelly, who is drafted into the US Army but really wants to join the Air Force. During training, he falls in love with Kathryn (played by Kathryn Grayson), the daughter of his commanding officer, who has similarly put her singing career on hold in order to serve by providing entertainment for the troops. Unusually for this type of a film (and for this era of Hollywood), the character Kathryn has only recently met her father for the first time since she was a baby, her parents having divorced. Peggy (Vera Lynn) is a young dancer in a London music hall. Meanwhile she encourages the young boy in the family to leave London as part of the evacuation plans.

In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, the citric acid cycle is crucial for the breakdown of fuel molecules, such as glucose and fatty acids, to generate ATP and provide the cell with energy. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide, high-energy electrons, and ATP. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Overall, these three components work together to convert glucose into ATP, providing the cells with the energy they need to carry out essential functions. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. In summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion.\n\nQuestion: how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is located at the base of the brain and is where the optic nerves partially cross over. This crossing allows for a specific arrangement of visual information to be transmitted to different areas of the brain. These optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where some fibers from each nerve cross over to join fibers from the opposite side. This crossing over of fibers has important implications for how visual information is processed in the brain. After crossing at the optic chiasm, these fibers continue their journey along pathways known as optic tracts towards specific regions in the brain responsible for processing visual information. The majority of these fibers go to a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in thalamus, which acts as a relay station before sending signals to other parts of the brain involved in vision, such as primary visual cortex. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain. A pathway consists of an optic nerve, the fibers of an optic nerve traveling through the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, and optic radiations terminating in an occipital lobe. Each optic nerve contains fibers from only one retina. The optic chiasm contains fibers from the nasal parts of the retinas of both eyes; these fibers cross to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe. Thus the optic tracts, occipital lobe, lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus, and optic chiasm each contain nerve fibers from both eyes. It is characterized by moderate disk elevation without hemorrhages. The visual pathways comprise the optic nerve and optic chiasm, which are essential for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. The optic nerve consists of about a million nerve fibers that arise from the inner, ganglion cell layer of the retina. These fibers pass through the lamina cribrosa of the sclera and then course through the optic canal of the skull to form the optic chiasm. Within the optic chiasm, fibers from the nasal half of the retina decussate (cross over to the opposite side), while fibers from the lateral (temporal) half do not cross over. This arrangement allows for the integration of visual information from both eyes in the brain. From the optic chiasm, the visual pathways continue to the visual cortex in the brain, where visual processing occurs. Both conditions involve structures such as the optic nerve and optic chiasm within the visual pathways. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain.

Cnidarians range in size from a mere handful of cells for the parasitic myxozoans through Hydra's length of 5 - 20 mm, to the Lion's mane jellyfish, which may exceed 2 m in diameter and 75 m in length. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Predators of cnidarians include: sea \n\n in the Barents Sea, an Atlantic-influenced Arctic shelf sea, are mainly sub-Arctic species including herring, young cod, and capelin. Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean. Carukia barnesi is an extremely venomous jellyfish found near Australia. Stings can result in Irukandji syndrome, and this species is commonly known as Irukandji jellyfish, although this name does not distinguish it from other Irukandji jellyfish such as Malo kingi. A mature C. barnesi's bell is only 12 by in height. The species was discovered by Dr. Jack Barnes of Cairns, Australia, who, while on an exploration mission aimed at determining the reason for Irukandji syndrome, allowed himself to be stung by the jellyfish, while his 14-year-old son and a lifeguard looked on.

Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa. As medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts.

In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front.

Intellectual Disability (ID): Athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behavior. Visually Impaired (VI): Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. W2 – athletes with paraplegia or a comparable impairment (with limited mobility in the lower limbs and full arm function). F52-F58 – other physical impairments. The team/player with the highest number of points at the end of play is the winner. If both teams have the same amount of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside of the competitor’s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested. This is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments. Teams may also use one guide, who is positioned off the field of play, to assist in directing players. For Class B2/B3 games, teams can field players in sport classes B2 and B3; at least two B2 players must be on the field at all times. Goalball is a team sport designed for blind athletes. Games consist of two 12 minute halves (formerly 10 minute halves). Blindfolds allow partially sighted players to compete on an equal footing with blind players. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee and is open to anyone with a minimum level of disability who can extend their arms within 20° of full extension during a lift. SH3 – Blind Shooters (sights seek sound-emitting targets). Disabled shooters use exactly the same guns and clothing as able-bodied shooters. The majority of rules for Paralympic swimming are the same as those for able-bodied competitions. Significant differences include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called “tappers” stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. Competitors in these events are required to wear blackened goggles, so that partially sighted swimmers compete at an even level with those who are totally blind.

Basketball has always had the concept of fouls. In 1891, James Naismith's original 13 rules defined a foul as: Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. Originally, on a player's second foul, the player would be removed without substitution until the next successful goal (similar to a penalty in ice hockey). Originally, any team member was allowed to shoot free throws. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below). last 5 seconds of the shot clock counted down in tenths of a second.

There are certain difficulties in evaluating suicide threats in DID. In fact, it is possible that the other alters are not aware of the suicidal tendencies of another alter, which is totally true for those who are not co-conscious. Suicidal alters are common. In DID systems, suicidal personalities exist, and they emerge as young or old. Yes, there are kid alters that are suicidal. Sometimes, alters that are not originally suicidal can have suicidal thoughts because of devastating flashbacks that can overpower them. In this instance, the alter is unable to control his temper, anxiety, and depression and feels continuously suicidal, which poses a threat to the main person. This is dangerous, as alters that have these patterns may not be able to understand that their behavior impacts the entire system. Unfortunately, some alters are aware of this yet just don’t care. They want only to wreak havoc on the other personalities, with the goal of destroying the whole system. Attention to this matter is a must. It is vital that there is a team of professionals capable of handling these alters and keeping all of them alive. Suicidality is real in DID and managing it is very important. It is rather complicated to deal with because it also involves the alters. It is vital to note that when one part has suicidal ideations, that part should be allowed to be heard and not to be ignored. I will talk about what the conditions are and what helpful things you can do about it. You might also have some episodes and probably thinking what the heck is the problem with you. For the record, there are a bunch of dissociative disorders. These are the psychological and emotional stuff we often consider normal. And yet not remembering anything is also part of the whole experience. With all of these expectations, we don’t have to think that what’s happening to us will make us crazy. We need contributing outlets that will stop us from getting too much overwhelmed. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is somewhat a misunderstood mental illness because of the uncertainty that characterizes it. Sometimes, even the family itself to which people with DID belong find it challenging to understand and respond to the effects and manifestations of DID.

The Mayflower departed from Plymouth, England aboard the Mayflower on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in \n\n future Mayflower passenger William White. She was mother of one son, Resolved, when she boarded the Mayflower and was pregnant during its voyage, giving birth to Peregrine in late November 1620, while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod. On 9/19 November 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. Edward Fuller boarded the Mayflower with his wife and a child. William Bradford, writing in 1651, recorded Mayflower passengers: \"Edward Fuller, and his wife, and Samuell, their sonne.\" The Mayflower departed from Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to death for many, especially the majority of women \n\n Per William Bradford, John Turner traveled on the Mayflower accompanied by his two sons, whose given names are unknown. She may have remained in Holland at the Mayflower sailing or more likely died before the sailing of the ship, which may explain why such young sons were traveling with him. John Turner departed Plymouth, England on the Mayflower on September 6/16, 1620.\n\nQuestion: who was the captain of the mayflower when it took the pilgrims to the new world\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. In November 1866, the Clevedon Pier Company was formed at a public meeting in the town. Construction of the pier started at a cost of £10,000, with John William Grover and Richard Ward as the engineers and Hans Price as the architect. The legs were constructed from Barlow rail which had previously been used on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's South Wales Railway, with wood planks for the decking. By August 1868 600 ft of the pier had been built and the final section was completed by February 1869. The pier was officially opened on 29 March 1869, with a parade, bands and a cannon volley by the First Somerset Artillery.

Cora stages the death of Snow White's mother, and manipulates Regina into becoming Snow's stepmother by marrying the girl's father, King Leopold. The show's spin-off, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, shows that Cora was the Red Queen's tutor in magic whilst in Wonderland; Cora apparently ruled part of the land and was a political rival of the Red King.

Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. Arizona is also one of the Four Corners states and is diagonally adjacent to Colorado. Of this area, just 0.32% consists of water, which makes Arizona the state with the second lowest percentage of water area (New Mexico is the lowest at 0.19%). Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52419 sqmi of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States. About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. These cities are spread out amongst the state. Texas has 254 counties, which is more than any other state by 95 (Georgia). Texas passed New York State in the 1990s to become the second-largest U.S. state in population, after California. The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South. Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. The large population increase can somewhat be attributed to Texas' relative insulation from the U.S. housing bubble. At the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census.\n\nQuestion: what is the 3rd largest state in usa\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I'm going for bloodwork this week, so it's on my mind. WOW ! THAT is impressive and gives me hope ! Wow! This is such wonderful news. this makes me happy and Hopeful. I hope I can get there someday I'm aiming for the 1 month mark right now but every day for the last 7 months I've had to keep starting over. You guys will get there for sure! Sorry to hear about that, especially after you'd been doing so well, but I guess that's the way it goes. I agree, I'm sorry to hear that your 12 year streak has come to an end However, it's quite awesome that you were able to go 12 years. Artheta, congrats on your 5 year mark too! My advice, if the options above come up, flee from your family and stay on those meds even if your doc thinks you could go off and be fine. Maybe I would have been fine, dunno. It could just be the nature of the beast and it may just be my time. He wants me to stay on Entocort and the 75mg of 6MP to see how I do (he said both can be used as maintenance drugs) and to start taking probiotics (Acidophilus) to increase the amount of good bacteria in my gut in hopes that they'll fight off the bad bacteria.

If so, for how long have I been going like this?? Could sleep apnea and Vit D deficiency both be the cause of my diabetes and not from the overuse of allergy meds as I assume is the cause???

The Royal Air Force has deployed Sentinel R1, Sentry AEW1, RC-135W Rivet Joint and Shadow R1 aircraft to gather surveillance, in addition to Tornado GR4 and MQ-9 Reaper strike aircraft. In September 2015, the United Kingdom was responsible for a third of all coalition surveillance flights over Iraq and Syria, with the Tornado GR4s RAPTOR reconnaissance pod accounting for 60% of the \n\n No. 2 Squadron withdrew from Germany after returning from the Gulf War – moving to RAF Marham in Norfolk flying the Panavia Tornado GR1A. A pair of Tornado GR4s left Cyprus armed with laser-guided bombs, supported by a Voyager aerial refueling tanker. Ultimately, the aircraft did not locate any targets requiring immediate air attack and so gathered intelligence for coalition forces instead. The Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted its first airstrike on 30 September 2014. A pair of Tornado GR4s engaged an ISIL heavy weapon position and an armed pickup truck using a laser-guided bomb and air-to-surface missile. On 3 October 2014, the RAF deployed two additional Tornado aircraft to bring its deployed fleet up to eight aircraft. On 10 September 2006 BAE won a £2.5bn (€3.7bn, $4.6bn) contract for the upgrade of 80 RSAF Tornado IDS'. In December 2013, it was announced that following the squadron's scheduled 2014 deployment to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, it was to stand down on 31 March 2015 as a Tornado squadron at Marham, and reactivate the following day (1 April 2015) as a Eurofighter Typhoon squadron at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. However, in October 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron said that the squadron's disbandment and reformation would be put on hold to allow Tornados to continue supporting strikes against ISIS.\n\nQuestion: how many tornado planes does the uk have\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ultimately, you have to deal with your own reactions as best you possibly can (think tolerance and patience). It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews. However, the object(s) of concern vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of selfishness. The word \"altruism\" was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\". It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. Because trust springs from faith, it strengthens hope and love, and is, moreover, linked up, in one way or another, with the moral virtues. It may, therefore, be called the basis on which the theological virtues unite with the moral. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.\" wait for what is desired ; Perseverance - ability to work steadily despite setbacks or difficulties ; Persistence - ability to continue or repeat a task in order to achieve a goal ; Virtues of regard ; Fair-mindedness - concern that all get their due (including oneself) in cooperative arrangements of mutual benefit ; Tolerance - willingness to allow others to lead a life based on a certain set of beliefs differing from one's own ; Truthfulness/Honesty - telling someone what you know to be true in the context of a direct inquiry ; Virtues of respect ; Respect - regard for the worth of others ; Self respect - regard \n\n Faith is an English feminine given name derived from the word faith. It became popularized when the Puritans began using it as a virtue name during the 17th century. Puritans also used Faith as part of longer phrase names, such as Be-faithful, Faithful, Faith-my-joy, and Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith. The name is also the usual English translation of the Greek name of Saint Faith, an early Christian child martyr who was tortured to death along with her sisters Hope and Charity. Faith, Hope and Charity, the three theological virtues, are names traditionally given to triplet girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for twin girls.\n\nQuestion: where does patience is a virtue come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

About 25% of Italian women do not have children while another 25% only have one child. The region of Liguria in northwestern Italy now has the highest ratio of elderly to youth in the world. Ten percent of Liguria's schools closed in the first decade of the 21st century. The city of Genoa, one of Italy's largest and the capital of Liguria, is declining faster than most European cities with a death rate of 13.7 deaths per 1,000 people, almost twice the birth rate, 7.7 births per 1,000 people,. The Italian government has tried to limit and reverse the trend by offering financial incentives to couples who have children, and by increasing immigration.

He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra'zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc. Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider, through his bond with Saphira. She tries to convince Urizen to restore Luvah, and is left to melancholy. He uses her to destroy Jesus who took upon the mantel of Luvah. Urizen, in turn, becomes the Dragon found in the Book of Revelation. Dragons are telepathic and are capable of forming a lifelong bond with one particular human in a process called Impression. The dragons come in several colors which generally correlate with their sizes; blue males, green females, brown males, bronze males, and golden females – queens.

The MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. Thus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production due to change in an autonomous variable by $1 =\n\n  From a starting point on the frontier, if there is no increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. There can also be synergies between products such that offering a range of products gives the consumer a more desirable product offering than would a single product. it can be more efficient to ship to any given location a range of products than a single type of product. Further economies of scope occur when there are cost savings arising from byproducts in the production process, such as when the benefits of heating from energy production has a positive effect on agricultural yields. There is an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas. They have identical preferences, based on lexicographic ordering: for every vector represents a complete and transitive relation, but it does not have an open graph. This economy does not have an equilibrium. If the price of bananas is some p > 0 (where the price of apples is normalized to 1), then both agents can afford the bundle (1+p, 0), which is strictly better than their allocation.\n\nQuestion: points outside the production possibilities curve represent combinations of products that are\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Much less interplate seismicity occurs in Oregon compared to Washington and northern California, although Oregon hosts more volcanic activity than its neighboring states. In 2009, some geologists predicted a 10% to 14% probability that the Cascadia Subduction Zone will produce an event of magnitude 9.0 or higher in the next 50 years. In 2010, studies suggested that the risk could be as high as 37% for earthquakes of magnitude 8.0 or higher. The Cascadia Subduction Zone, which forms the boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates, is a very long sloping fault that stretches from mid-Vancouver Island to Northern California. Because of the great length of the fault, the Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large earthquakes if rupture occurs along its entire length. The highest density of tremor activity in Cascadia occurs from northern Washington into southern Vancouver Island, and in northern California. Tremor in Cascadia is monitored by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network's semi-automatic tremor detection system. The majority of interplate earthquakes, or earthquakes that occur near the boundaries of tectonic plates, near the Cascadia subduction zone occur in the forearc of the overriding North American Plate in Washington, west of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and east of where tremor occurs. These earthquakes are \n\n The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years.\n\nQuestion: what is the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the pacific northwest\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird. Japan finished the Games with 58 total medals, 27 being gold, an improvement of the previous performances from the 1964 Olympics (also held in Tokyo) and 2004 Olympics. By total medals, they also fell behind the Russian Olympic Committee, and the United Kingdom. It was the most successful Summer Olympics in the country's history. The 1932 Summer Olympics, referred to by the International Olympic Committee as the Games of the X Olympiad, were held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from July 30 through August 14, 1932. Athletes from the United States were the most successful, winning 103 medals during the games, 41 of which were gold. Medals were awarded in a total of 116 events across 16 sports. Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.

The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: \"The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.\" Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20). Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology, \n\n The intention of sustainable design is to \"eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design\".

The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability.

Colorado Division of Wildlife personnel recently found out just how indestructible prions are when they tried to eradicate CWD from a contaminated facility. Here’s another reason for people who don’t live in rural areas to fear prion diseases like CWD: Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the University of California at San Diego and UC-San Francisco, found that people with CJD have the prions in their eyes. Where do prion diseases come from? Captive deer operations are a main source of CWD due to their concentration of animals, “communicability window” (from trophy stock trading and escaped animals) and questionable feed sources. In a four-part expose, the Indiana Star revealed how “the pursuit of deer bred for enormous antlers and shot in hunting pens” on trophy farms is spreading CWD at an alarming rate. In the mid-1960s, the Department of Wildlife ran a series of nutritional studies on wild deer and elk at the Foothills Wildlife Research Facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Soon after the studies began, however, Foothills deer and elk began dying from a mysterious disease. It turns out that the deer may have developed CWD as a result of being held at the same facility with sheep that had had scrapie, a fatal, degenerative prion disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats. Can you get Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by eating CWD-infected deer meat? The official position of Departments of Natural Resources (DNR), which depend on revenue from deer-hunting licenses, is that humans can’t get CJD from eating venison from deer infected with CWD. The study, “Fatal Degenerative Neurologic Illnesses in Men Who Participated in Wild Game Feasts,” found numerous cases of hunters and/or men who ate venison who had developed CJD. They tell hunters not to eat a deer’s brain, eyeballs, spinal cord, spleen and lymph nodes. • Avoid eating venison, especially if it comes from “farmed” deer fed animal waste. • Avoid any meat that comes from a factory farm. Factory farms often feed confined animals slaughterhouse waste, or rendered animal protein. This practice is prohibited in organic meat production. • Call for an end to game farms. Deer breeding and “trophy farms” are a $4-billion/year industry. Farmers operate canned “hunts” in which bucks with trophy antlers can fetch six figures. Customers are guaranteed a kill, and the animals are sometimes drugged. Deer farm operators also sell antlers, velvet, urine and meat. • Protest the widespread trapping and killing of wolves. • Call on the CDC to require autopsies on people whose death certificate reads “Alzheimer’s disease” or “dementia.” Many of these people, especially deer hunters, actually have died from CJD but are buried or cremated with no disclosure. Allow wolves to eat the deer. I think I’d rather have deer infected than wolves. CWD is a significant problem in the USA, where many deer are killed each year. Red deer, and possibly other species, are considered maintenance hosts for TB and this may have important consequences for activities aimed at tackling the disease in cattle. CWD is similar to BSE and scrapie, but affects only cervids (deer and elk). There are no reports of CWD from the wild in Britain, but the first European case was diagnosed in a female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from the Nordfjella population in southern Norway during March 2016. Since then, some 25,000 wild deer in Norway have been tested, 11 of which were found to be infected: seven wild reindeer from the mountains of south-central Norway, three moose (Alces alces) near the Swedish border and a single Red deer. CWD is currently a significant problem in the deer and elk populations of the United States. First identified in a captive mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Colorado during the late 1960s, it has been present in wild deer herds since 1981. Wide-scale surveillance programs have led to a decline in 'reactions' (animals testing positive for the disease) in many parts of America, but recent lapses in surveillance have led to an increase in some states, including Alberta. According to an article in The Guardian newspaper, prior to the introduction of CWD surveillance in the US, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado alone as many as one-in-ten deer and one-in-twenty elk were thought to be infected. At present, culling elk and deer, along with imposing fines for people feeding them (which draws deer from miles around and increases the potential for infection) are the only ways that authorities have found to get a handle on the situation. Interestingly, the prions identified from the Norwegian reindeer are very similar to those found in North American deer, suggesting they may have been imported with deer products from the USA. Importation of infected elk (Cervus canadensis) from Canada during the mid-1990s resulted in outbreaks in North Korea during 2001, 2004 and 2005. Given the known migratory patterns of moose, authorities are concerned there is a high probability that the disease will spread to Sweden, if it hasn’t already. Indeed, a survey of mammal carcasses collected by the Food and Environment Research Agency in York confirmed bovine TB in 1% of the Red deer (Cervus elaphus) specimens, although the report did conclude that Red and Fallow (Dama dama) posed the greatest threat of transmitting the disease to cattle and that the gregarious nature of these species is likely to aid the spread of the bacteria. A study of the patterns of these lesions in 35 Red deer shot by hunters in France led Gina Zanella at AFSSA (France’s equivalent to DEFRA) and her team of epidemiologists to conclude that Red deer were more likely to spread the disease to other animals than wild boar were. Unlike boar, deer react to bTB infection by forming abscesses, which provides some resistance to the disease (i.e. Curiously, however, there is currently no statutory surveillance of TB in farmed, park or wild deer of any species in Britain. Indeed, 13% of Red deer culled in Northern Ireland between 1996 and 1997 tested positive for the disease, as did nearly 3% of the 340 deer culled in an Irish national park during 1997. Bovine TB seems more prevalent in deer outside of the UK and a survey of Red deer and wild boar killed during the 2001/02 hunting season in Normandy, France revealed that both species were ‘heavily infected by M. bovis’. According to a paper published in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases during 2002 by a team of scientists at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, PTB was found in a population of about 1,000 free-ranging Fallow deer between 1997 and 1998 in Spain. It should be noted that the incidence of TB in deer is very low, as are records of deer carrying anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease and Lyme disease. During the Hyderabad schedule of the film, some villagers of Anajpur village in Rangareddy district in Telangana had tried to halt the shooting of Lingaa, stating that some chemicals were mixed in the nearby lake during shoots, polluting local water. But the crew members stated that they had sought the permission of the irrigation department and the village Panchayat for shooting. The crew members also dismissed allegations of chemicals in the lake. During the shooting of the climax portions near the Linganamakki Dam, environmental organisations opposed the permission granted to the production unit for shooting, suggesting a threat to the location as public \n\n Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kheri has two core areas, Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, which were merged in 1987. Dudhwa National Park is known as the first National Park of the state after the formation of Uttarakhand and is a national protected area. It is home to many rare and endangered species including tigers, leopards, rhinoceros, hispid hare, elephants, black deer and swamp deer. Dudhwa has approximately 400 species of birds including egrets, cormorants, herons and several species of duck, goose and teal. Its swamps and lakes are particularly attractive to water birds, including varieties that migrate here from the Himalayas to spend the winter months. Bird watching is common at the Banke Tal. The visit of Sir D.B. Brandis in 1860 to the area culminated \n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD), sometimes called zombie deer disease, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting deer. In the US, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, caribou, and moose. In addition, CWD has been found in one Minnesota red deer farm, one wild reindeer herd in Norway (March 2016) as well as in wild moose. Single cases of CWD in moose have been found in Finland (March 2018) and in Sweden (March and May 2019, September 2020). CWD was found in South Korea in some deer imported from Canada. No relationship is known between CWD and any other TSEs of animals or people. Williams performed necropsies on deer and elk that had died of an unknown syndrome. It read in conclusion that \"Although no association between (animal) CWD and (the feastors in Wisconsin who happened to have) CJD was found, continued surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk for CWD transmission to humans.\" Quebec farm outbreak The MFFP ministry in Quebec practiced 9500 tests in the period between 2007 and autumn 2018 before they detected a seropositive case in September 2018. The September 2018 discovery of CWD on a managed operation in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge Quebec prompted a wholesale slaughter of 3500 animals in two months before the enterprise shut down permanently. The CFIA ordered the cull, as well as the decontamination of 10 inches of soil in certain places on the 1000-acre operation. Other Quebec producers lamented the glut of supply. A 400 km quarantine area was declared, in which all hunting and trapping activities were banned. The government slaughtered hundreds of wild animals over a two-month period. When the producer was forced to close, the weekly slaughter neared 500 animals per week. Since 2014, however, the CFIA has allowed animals from CWD-infected farms to enter the food chain because there is \"no national requirement to have animals tested for the disease\". From one CWD-infected herd in Alberta, 131 elk were sold for human consumption. For the fall 2019 hunting season in western Quebec, the provincial ministry relaxed the rules for the annual white-tailed deer (WTD) hunt, in an effort to curb the spread of CWD. Any WTD can be hunted with any weapon in certain municipalities in the Outaouais valley and the Laurentides. The quarantine around Grenville was still in place, and the ministry specifically prohibited (only) the \"removal\" from the quarantine \"enhanced monitoring area\" zone of \"the head, more specifically any part of the brain, the eyes, the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils, any part of the spinal column, the internal organs (including the liver and the heart), and the testicles.\" Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease.\n\nQuestion: where was the killing of a sacred deer filmed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In its last annual report (2009) Massey Energy reported coal sales of 38 million tons (ranking sixth in the US), compared to 84.8 million tons sold by Alpha Natural Resources in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Massey Energy had a coal shipment shortfall of 1.4 million tons, half of which was due to rail problems, and the other half a result of misproduction. coal to oil and gas for their energy needs, and the industry yet again experienced a downturn. By 2001 8.36 billion tons of coal had been extracted from Kentucky, 5.78 billion tons coming from the Eastern Coalfield and 2.58 billion tons coming from the Western Coalfield. Coal's total economic impact is significant, with over 125.96 million tons of coal \n\n in 2006, making Kentucky 3rd in the nation for coal production. The state supplies 10.6% of the country with coal for power plants, giving it the nation's second-largest market share. Arguably coal's biggest economic impact has been low electric rates in Kentucky, which gives the state a competitive advantage in attracting industry, including those with heavy energy demands such as aluminum smelters and automotive plants. Electric utilities in Kentucky that use coal \"are struggling to stay competitive by converting their power plants to other sources of fuel amid a downturn in the nation's coal industry and in response to stringent environmental regulations,\" according to Daily Energy Insider.

However, some loans were so clearly lacking in quality that Fannie and Freddie wouldn't take a chance on buying them.

The electors are \"appointed\" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs \"on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.\" After Election Day, the electors chosen in each state must then \"meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December,\" with meetings of electors typically held in each state capital.

In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. One early virtue of this wording was that if certain states decided not to participate in the election by failing to appoint any electors, a president could still be elected by a majority of those who were appointed. However, when Congress rejects a state's electoral vote, or chooses not to count any of multiple competing returns, \"the effect that decision has on the denominator that determines whether a candidate has more than fifty percent of the electoral vote is an entirely open issue.\".

On 31 March 2020, the first COVID-19 death in El Salvador was confirmed. Transparency International cited El Salvador and Colombia as examples of an \"explosion of irregularities and corruption cases\" related to the handling of the pandemic in Latin America.

Timeline March 2020 On March 6, El Salvador government declared yellow alert in the country a few hours after Costa Rica reported the first confirmed case in that country. The Office of the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights of El Salvador head, Apolonio Tobar, considered the actions taken by the government as \"improvised\". On March 16, a diplomatic dispute between El Salvador and Mexico developed when President Bukele accused the Mexican government of \"being irresponsible\" allowing a dozen people with COVID-19 to board a plane bound for El Salvador International Airport. Mexican foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said \"all flights to El Salvador, including the one mentioned by the president [Bukele], have been cancelled\"; furthermore, Mexican deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez denied the charge, and declared that tests showed the individuals in question were virus-free. On March 18, President Bukele announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in El Salvador, which was detected in the Hospital Nacional General \"Arturo Morales\", in Metapán. On March 21, El Salvador declared a 30-day curfew in response to the coronavirus crisis. On March 31, the first COVID-19 death in El Salvador was confirmed—a woman over 60 who arrived from United States on 12 March who was classified in a critical state. The government also announced they have registered until that day 78 COVID-19 confirmed cases, also reporting one more death and three recoveries. Furthermore, the fourth death was reported by the government— a 41-year-old man who arrived from Guatemala on 15 March.

On 15 April, the International Monetary Fund announced the approval of 389 million dollars to El Salvador, with the purpose of strengthening the most affected places of the country. On 16 April, the Supreme Court of El Salvador ruled that the government couldn't confiscate vehicles, property or arrest people for allegedly failing to comply with quarantine order without congressional legislation approving the measures. Bukele stated his intentions to defy the ruling. May 2020 President Nayib Bukele's “containment centers” where thousands of Salvadorans have been detained for more than a month at a time without judicial review, came under criticism from human rights advocates. June 2020 On 22 June, President Bukele dedicated the first phase of the Hospital El Salvador, a permanent conversion of the former (CIFCO) in San Salvador.

ALKA was made of aluminium and had a tab or twin tabs that were pulled to remove the cap. Production of the ALKA cap took place on the bottling line. The MaxiCap was produced from 1979 at Wicanders’ factory in Hämeenlinna Finland, now known has Finn-Korkki Oy. They were easier to use than the ALKA and pre-manufactured outside of the bottling plant. This allowed for increased production speeds on the bottling line. Soon after the MaxiCap came the RingCrown closure. Moving into a Northside location in 2009, the company did not think they would reach the production limit as laid out by the state of Montana.

Early childhood development begins with nutrition support for babies and toddlers, nursing mothers, pregnant women, and even malnourished adolescent girls and women of childbearing age, as roughly 20 per cent of severe malnutrition begins before birth due to maternal malnutrition. Critical for young children is access to health care, starting with ante- and postnatal visits for pregnant women, delivery by a skilled birth attendant, and including vaccinations, treatment of chronic and acute illness, and routine check ups. These interventions include access to clean drinking water, hand washing practises, toilet facilities, and proper disposal of diapers. Opportunities for play and early learning are just as important to healthy development as physical support. Good quality preschools also improve school readiness and can lead to better primary school outcomes, particularly for poor and disadvantaged students. Especially in the last 15 years, I am proud to say that Kenya has made tremendous strides in improving the lives and prospects of our youngest children. An estimated 38.3 per cent of Kenyan children ages 3 and 4 are not reaching their cognitive and socioemotional milestones, which can hold them back from succeeding in school and reaching their full potential. The youngest children, the poor, and the marginalised are still the most likely to be left behind and to miss out on essential services. Too many of our children do not have access to clean water or adequate playthings or quality care. All Kenyans have a role to play in ensuring a bright future for our children and for Kenya. It’s time for everyone to make early childhood development a top priority. But poverty, lack of access to services, inadequate resources, and violence prevent too many families from being able to provide essential support to their children in the first five years. Too many Kenyan children are unable to access the care they need in the early years, putting them at a significant disadvantage. Further, 34 per cent of Kenyans are below the international poverty line, living on less than $1.90 per day, and 56 per cent of Kenya’s urban population live in informal settlements. Children born into these poor or disadvantaged families and communities are very unlikely to have access to everything they need to grow and develop and may arrive into the world already trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty. Developmental differences between those children who have what they need to develop healthy brains and bodies and those who do not can show up as early as nine months old. The negative impacts of inadequate care, nutrition, and cognitive stimulation during these early months and years can last a lifetime. This is where early childhood development comes in. Early childhood development (ECD) is all the things a child needs to grow up with a strong, healthy body and brain — health care and good nutrition for mother and child, access to play and early learning opportunities, child protection and quality care, and more. Even though the importance of providing nurturing care — including health, nutrition, play, learning, and protection — has been thoroughly proven, investment in the 0 to 5 age group is still far too small. This report shows the progress that Kenya has made in improving access to early years services as well as how much more there is to do to ensure every child has the best start in life. We hope this report will serve as one tool for the many diverse advocates and actors coming together to continue making great things happen for children in Kenya. The growth and development of the brain and body in the early years of life lay the foundation for health,\n\n Helena has a long record of economic stability with its history as being the state capital and being founded in an area rich in silver and lead deposits. However, this situation has resulted in a slow growing economy. Its status as capital makes it a major hub of activity at the county, state, and federal level. According to the Helena Area Chamber of Commerce, the capital's median household income is $50,889, and its unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in 2013, about 1.2% lower than the rest of the state. Education is a major employer, with two high schools and accompanying elementary and middle schools for K–12 students as well as Helena College. Major private employers within the city of Helena include Carroll College and the medical community. Helena's economy is also bolstered by Fort William Henry Harrison, the training facility for the Montana National Guard, located just outside the city.

SI joint dysfunction is sometimes referred to as \"sacroiliac joint instability\" or \"sacroiliac joint insufficiency\" due to the support the once strong and taut ligaments can no longer sustain. The sacroiliac joint itself often will not show degenerative changes, such as arthritis, until many years of the dysfunction being allowed to continue. Injury to the ligaments that hold the sacroiliac joints in proper support is thought to be caused by a torsion or high impact injury (such as an automobile accident) or a hard fall, resulting in the hypermobility. This is thought to result in the ilium and sacral surfaces \"locking\" in an incongruent or asymmetrical fashion (one innominate bone is tilted anteriorly; the other innominate bone is tilted posteriorly) causing pain that can be debilitating. Pelvic joint pain in post pregnancy women is thought to be derived from the inability of the stretched out ligaments to return to normal tautness. Certain biomechanical or muscle length imbalances may ultimately predispose a person to sacroiliac dysfunction and pain. Likely, this is a result of altered gait patterns and repetitive stress to the SI joint and related structures. These conditions exist in persons with leg-length inequality, scoliosis, a history of polio, poor-quality footwear, and hip osteoarthritis. Hypomobility Pathological hypomobility (too little movement) of the sacroiliac joint is an intra-articular disorder in which the joint locks due to wearing down with age or degenerative joint disease. Pathophysiology The sacroiliac joint is a true diarthrodial joint that joins the sacrum to the pelvis. The sacrum connects on the right and left sides to the ilia (pelvic bones) to form the sacroiliac joints. The pelvic girdle is made up of two innominate bones (the iliac bones) and the sacrum. The innominate bones join in the front of the pelvis to form the pubic symphysis, and at back of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac (SI) joints. Each innominate bone (ilium) joins the femur (thigh bone) to form the hip joint; thus the sacroiliac joint moves with walking and movement of the torso. In this joint, hyaline cartilage on the sacral side moves against fibrocartilage on the iliac side. The sacroiliac joint contains numerous ridges and depressions that function in stability. These can all be a source of pain and inflammation if the SI joint is dysfunctional. The sacroiliac joint is highly dependent on its strong ligamentous structure for support and stability. The deep anterior, posterior, and interosseous ligaments resist the load of the sacrum relative to the ilium. Affected muscle groups Many large and small muscles have relationships with the ligaments of the sacroiliac joint including the piriformis (see “piriformis syndrome”, a condition often related with sacroiliac joint dysfunction), rectus femoris, gluteus maximus and minimus, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, thoracolumbar fascia, and iliacus. Any of these muscles can be involved or spasm with a painful and dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. The SI joint is a pain-sensitive structure richly innervated by a combination of unmyelinated free nerve endings and the posterior primary rami of spinal segments L2-S3. Diagnosis Perhaps the biggest reason for misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is based on the inability of common radiological imaging to discern the disorder. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain emanating within the sacroiliac joint. Pressure should then be directed downward on the leg in order to achieve hip extension and stress the sacroiliac joint. Pressure is applied downward to the uppermost iliac crest. Then, downward pressure is applied to the medial knee stressing both the hip and sacroiliac joint.

Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia. Broadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Sacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint.

The innominate bones join in the front of the pelvis to form the pubic symphysis, and at back of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac (SI) joints. Each innominate bone (ilium) joins the femur (thigh bone) to form the hip joint; thus the sacroiliac joint moves with walking and movement of the torso. In this joint, hyaline cartilage on the sacral side moves against fibrocartilage on the iliac side. The sacroiliac joint contains numerous ridges and depressions that function in stability. These can all be a source of pain and inflammation if the SI joint is dysfunctional. The sacroiliac joint is highly dependent on its strong ligamentous structure for support and stability. The deep anterior, posterior, and interosseous ligaments resist the load of the sacrum relative to the ilium. Affected muscle groups Many large and small muscles have relationships with the ligaments of the sacroiliac joint including the piriformis (see “piriformis syndrome”, a condition often related with sacroiliac joint dysfunction), rectus femoris, gluteus maximus and minimus, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, thoracolumbar fascia, and iliacus. Any of these muscles can be involved or spasm with a painful and dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. The SI joint is a pain-sensitive structure richly innervated by a combination of unmyelinated free nerve endings and the posterior primary rami of spinal segments L2-S3. Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction can also develop tightness and dysfunction in the hamstring, quadriceps, iliotibial tract (see “iliotibial band syndrome”) and hip flexors, including the psoas muscle. Diagnosis Perhaps the biggest reason for misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is based on the inability of common radiological imaging to discern the disorder. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain emanating within the sacroiliac joint. Pressure should then be directed downward on the leg in order to achieve hip extension and stress the sacroiliac joint. Pressure is applied downward to the uppermost iliac crest. Then, downward pressure is applied to the medial knee stressing both the hip and sacroiliac joint. The examiner provides either a quick thrust or steadily increasing pressure through the line of the femur.

It was written by Petey Martin, Jordan Smith, and Tedd T and produced by Steve Mac with a remix version produced by Steve Aoki. Director David Leitch wanted to create an original song for Deadpool 2 that could support the emotional core of the film, with \"Ashes\" being the song that was ultimately written. She called the stern sense of loss Cohen voiced, in the song, \"a touch disproportionate\", given his long history of finding lovers who were already in relationships with other men. Despite being performed in a major key, the ballad compensates by using \"vocals, slowness, and mirroring the haunting theme\" of the score. Variety's Jerome Weeks wrote that the song \"combines a lovely descending-line melody with one of Rice’s most touching efforts in the way the Beast haltingly, almost inarticulately grapples with his developing love.\" Thomas S. Hischak, author of The Disney Song Encyclopedia, observed that the track boasts \"a resounding, operatic tone that is far heavier\" than the film's original songs. Jo Litson of Limelight identified the song as a \"tenor \n\n \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" and \"King Harvest (Has Surely Come).\" The reference to a harvest moon provides a more direct link to the theme of harvest which runs through The Band and especially \"King Harvest (Has Surely Come),\" which is the last song on The Band and so helps \n\n thematic unity to the album. To Harris, this link helps define the journey undertaken in The Band, from the \"idealism\" of \"Across the Great Divide\" to \"stark reality\" of \"King Harvest.\" Band organist Garth Hudson plays saxophone in addition to organ on the song.\n\nQuestion: what is the song in red dead redemption\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The best way to get lycopene is in tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato juice, and even ketchup. Lycopene is most concentrated in tomato paste. Tomatoes also contain a compound called chlorogenic acid, which may help guard against cancer by blocking the effects of certain environmental toxins—for instance, nitrosamines, cancer-causing compounds in tobacco smoke and cured meat. ** The jellylike substance surrounding tomato seeds is high in salicylates, which have an anticlotting effect on the blood.

While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. This makes it popular in low-cost cooking. Stews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two. Generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat. While raw tomatoes contain lycopene, cooked tomatoes actually provide more lycopene per gram. To maximize the absorption of fat-soluble phytonutrients present in tomatoes, it is recommended to add a small amount of fat to your meal when consuming foods like tomatoes. Tomato juice concentrate is also a rich source of potassium, which can help decrease the risk of stroke. Additionally, tomatoes and other vegetables contribute to reducing oxidation when consumed with meals. Tomato products, such as paste, can be a healthy addition to family dinners by incorporating vegetables and providing essential nutrients. While tomatoes have not been found to suppress tumor cell growth in most cancers, the lycopene present in tomatoes may have a protective effect against prostate cancer and cervical cancer.

Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, with eruptions occurring on average roughly every three years (in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland). About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions.

Despite Sequan's unwillingness, Lori manages to befriend him, bringing him out of his shell and eventually introducing him to both moonshine and her gay brother, Jake (Aidan Schultz-Meyer). Michael (not his real name) is a three-year old boy with Apert’s syndrome. Although it is an autosomal dominant condition, 98% of the cases are sporadic mutation of FGFR2 gene in chromosome 10. All of the above, I knew before meeting Michael for the first time. I felt like I knew a lot about Michael. What I found out, through home visits and catch up chats with his mother, was how little I knew about Michael himself. Like his mother told me repeatedly, Apert’s syndrome is only a tiny part of who Michael is. It’s not only confined to a hospital setting either. Your old girlfriend Jenny becomes a Miss L, a 24-year-old woman with a high risk of ectopic pregnancy. Heck, we’re not even talking about people anymore. So the first thing I did when I met him was to tick off the check list. I don’t know why, but the first time I met Michael, I decided to go up to him to shake his hand. Predictably, Michael ignored my hand and ran away from me. His parents laughed and told me not to take it personally. I’m not sure what I was expecting. I just stood back and watch him play at the paediatric outpatients’ playground. The paediatrician was running late, so I stood there for a good 10 minutes, just watching Michael play. This time around, he was a little bit more used to me. Michael wanted his. Michael loves playing in the back garden with his father. That is what his mother said to me. And it pretty much sums up the family’s attitude. One of the things that she decided from the start is that she was not going to let anything get in the way of Michael’s health. Michael’s father decided to stay home to look after his son. Her initial, honest feeling was “gutted”. “I do feel a bit guilty, thinking back now. But at least one of us loved him dearly from the start.” And soon enough, she had begun to treasure her son. From the start, the family fought as a unit. Michael’s maternal grandparents are dead and his paternal grandparents are in North Island. Wherever Michael’s treatment takes them, they go as a team. They stay at Ronald McDonald House. They meet nurses who work their hardest to make their stay as pleasant as possible. In the bedroom next door, a young mother is sleeping next to her terminally ill daughter. The same woman who would come up to you next morning to wish you luck for Michael’s operation. You realise that people care. She just sits there, ready to listen. One of Michael’s surgeons visits a country in South East Asia every year to give free prosthetic legs to the child victims of landmines. Michael is not the only person being fixed on these long, nervous surgery trips. I can’t help but think that Michael’s family must be an inspiration to somebody else. I don’t say this to his mother because it sounds so cheesy. Were you expecting that we are all the same? Hopefully, I’ve drawn you a better picture of who Michael is. After talking to his mother and just getting to know Michael, it soon became clear that this congenital disease is only a small part of who he is. Mr Smith is your next door neighbour who happens to have COPD. The same Mr Smith who made you cheese-on-toast after school when you forgot your house key.

Between 1905 and 1911 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) purchased or built seventeen steam rail cars, some running into the 1940s. Shortly after the Stockton and Darlington Railway in England opened (1825) he visited it and observed George Stephenson's Locomotion in operation and acquired two of his engines, which however proved unreliable in French conditions. These locomotives weighed 85 ST and operated \n\n Colliery.

Blücher was modelled on Matthew Murray’s locomotive Willington, which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road.

In March 1939, the British gave up on plans to avoid sending an army to the continent in the event of conflict with German and to rely on the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. On 4 September, an RAF raid \n\n By late 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. Appeasement of Germany—giving in to its demands—was the government's policy until early 1939. Instead of satiation Hitler then seized the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and menaced Poland. In response Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain rejected further appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler unexpectedly cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead. Although Britain and France honoured these guarantees by declaring war two days after Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \"Phoney War\". Further, neither the British Empire nor the French ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (16 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West).\n\nQuestion: when did the united kingdom entered world war 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

METHODS: A multivariate equation incorporating prior student academic performance was used to model performance of those classes on the USMLE Step 1 examination. There was an increase in the means of professionalism, communication, organizational efficiency and oral presentations over time (p < .01) as theoretically expected. The mean increase in the overall assessment results in a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.87); growth followed an expected power curve (Thurstone Function). In July 2016, the NBME convened a Task Force to explore incorporation of this reference into the USMLE. METHODS: Task Force members, including biochemistry and clinician educators, experienced National Board item writers, and NBME staff, 1) debated benefits and challenges to use of the map on the USMLE, 2) worked in pairs to create and critique new USMLE-style items that depend on skillful utilization of the map, and 3) reviewed existing items to determine the impact access to a reference map might have. The group also identified risks and possible unintended consequences for medical education and learning. Assess a student’s ability to manage a random case (much like they would experience on their rotation). Identify growth opportunities for students using formative feedback just prior to beginning their Clerkships. Students were blind to both cases, one fixed across all four days, and the other randomized. At the end of each session, students were provided immediate feedback by a clinician or a standardized patient. Initial attempts to create learning objectives for these concepts failed. Often, basic scientists wrote detailed learning objectives that lacked clinical applications while clinicians wrote objectives without apparent basic science underpinnings. We hypothesized that students would benefit both academically and emotionally from this experience. Students wrote a one-word reflection to summarize their initial reaction, followed by a large group debrief with a panel of critical care, palliative care, psychiatry, and spiritual care faculty. 94% of students felt the session was either “somewhat” or “very helpful,” and 99% “somewhat”\n\nStudents with reading deficits often use various methods and tools to help them review material and improve their reading skills. Some commonly used methods and tools include tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers. Tape recorders are beneficial for students with reading deficits as they allow for the recording of lectures or class discussions. By using tape recorders, students can focus on understanding the content without the pressure of keeping up with the reading or taking notes simultaneously. Tutorial aids are another helpful resource for students with reading deficits. These aids can include visual aids, such as charts, diagrams, or illustrations, that help visualize and simplify complex information. Additionally, tutorial aids may include step-by-step guides or summaries that provide a concise overview of the material. These aids serve as valuable supplements to the reading material and facilitate comprehension for students with reading difficulties. Laptop computers are also commonly used by students with reading deficits. For example, text-to-speech software can read the written content aloud, allowing students to follow along and listen to the text. These technological tools provide alternative ways for students to engage with and process information. It is important to note that the Orton phonologic method has been widely used for individuals with reading deficits. In conclusion, students with reading deficits utilize various methods and tools such as tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers to review material and improve their reading skills. These resources offer alternative ways to access and understand information, catering to individual needs and enhancing learning outcomes. One statement that is not true about the Didactic method is that it promotes passive learning. The Didactic method, also known as the lecture method, is a teaching approach where the instructor plays a central role in delivering information to students. However, it is important to note that the Didactic method can still involve active learning strategies alongside the lecture component. While the Didactic method primarily involves the instructor presenting information, it does not necessarily exclude opportunities for active learning. In fact, certain elements of active learning can be incorporated into a Didactic teaching session to promote deeper understanding and active engagement among students. It is worth highlighting that while the Didactic method is mainly focused on information transmission from the instructor to the students, it does not imply that all passive learning is encouraged. Educators can employ various strategies to make the Didactic method more interactive and promote active engagement among students. There are no drugs available to cure or treat Broca’s aphasia. Relaxation may help with overdone effort. Use imitation. The clinician starts with short phrases and sentences and gradually expands the length. Build on what the patient uses by adding to their utterances. Imitating the speech of clinician. Start with short sentences and gradually add to the length. Start with repetition of words. Answering questions from a story or picture. Require patient to name pictures or objects. These cues may include: the first sound of the word, sentence completion, it rhymes with, function, location, word spelled out loud, and synonym/antonym. Choose words that are useful to the patient. Work on categories, associations, word combinations. Use pictures that have meaning to the patient. Family picture albums can help with important names. Work on production techniques addressed previously. Use pictures showing syntactic structures. Use materials that have meaning to the patient-for instance, a church bulletin from their church, a grocery add from the paper, a letter from a friend, the horoscope, a section of the paper that they are interested in, a greeting card, etc. Depending on the level that the patient is functioning, pointing out letters that the clinician sounds out sounding may be the beginning point. After that is mastered, tracing letters, copying letters and then writing letters should be performed. Then the clinician spells words letter by letter, says words and the patient writes them and copies structured sentences. Finally, the patient writes sentences to dictation and writes sentences using words from the clinician. Teach survival writing skills. These include: signing forms, writing shopping lists, writing checks, writing notes to friends in cards or letters. b. Use drawings to show placements of sounds. communication has little meaning to them. Start with sounds. h. Neurobehavioral reorganization approaches to treatment can be taught, such as the use of gestures and melodic intonation therapy. Many repetitions are needed to stabilize newly acquired responses and make them automatic. Adjust utterance length to match the patient’s respiratory capacity. The clinician says a sentence and then asks a question with exaggerated stress. However, this contains everything you need to be minimally competent. You should start by knowing this material really well before you venture into further content. We recommend using this guide to structure your studying. It is developed with mnemonics and clinical vignettes for maximum retention with minimal time. It includes pathology, pharmacology, all therapeutic modalities, and more. It is extremely well-received and highly recommended. This is a resource than can be extremely helpful depending on which courses you’ve taken, how notes were provided, or how good your notes were. This is very individualized, as you can imagine, so you will have to use your judgement. One warning we have is that you don’t want to add on too much volume to your studying, otherwise it will be difficult to manage. Only add course notes that you think will be particularly helpful. Though courses that are offered are helpful, using their notes to study was not. This resource provides you with 1000+ flashcards that are considered high-yield. You will be able to quiz yourself and separate the questions by fully dozens of customizable content categories, including: Pharmacology, Botanical Medicine, Nutrition, Orthopedic Tests, Homeopathy, Pathology. It provides the most comprehensive list of questions currently on the market. This reference text started as a compilation of notes written by and shared among University of Toronto students to study for their medical licensing exams. Our recommendation is to use this text as a reference text, or when lacking information about a pathology from your primary study text. Toronto Notes is also particularly useful for its acronyms located in the margins, which can be used as memory aids. This is one of the few physical book that contains almost all of the required study material in a single place and is designed specifically with NPLEX in mind. The flashcards they provide for therapeutic modalities are particularly helpful. Recently declared as being out of business, but if you can get your hands on the materials, still useful. The study manual can now also be accessed through Wild Brilliance Press. There are study materials that are prepared for these purposes. Some of these resources are more applicable than others. We recommend at least some exposure to these questions if you desire additional practice at exam-writing. The USMLE resources are most useful for improving your knowledge in pathology and diagnosis, lab tests, imaging, and pharmacology. Clinical Key can be an excellent reference material for pathology. We do not recommend it as a primary study resource due to its large volume. It should be used mostly for clarification. This is when it becomes important to look to texts like Ferri’s to simplify complex pathologies into a few paragraphs and key points. Ferri’s is available at various bookstores or online. It contains complete information about pharmaceuticals. It is useful in deciphering what is the top indication for a drug, or what are the top side effects for a drug. If using this resource, we caution you not to get lost in the wealth of information. Pick out exactly what information you require and then look exactly for that. It is available from CCNM Press.\n\nQuestion: who invented the cornell method of note taking\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The poet and editor Sarah Josepha Hale wrote that Wells, as a child, had a \"passionate love of reading and music,\" and began to write verses when very young. In 1830, Wells published Poems and Juvenile Sketches, a compilation of her early work, after which she contributed occasionally to various periodicals. Hale opined that \"the predominant characteristics of [Wells'] poetry were tenderness of feeling, and simplicity and perspicuity of language.\" Wells' contemporaries, in addition to Sarah Hale, were Caroline Howard Gilman, Hannah Flagg Gould, Eliza Leslie, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, and Lydia Huntley Sigourney\n\n in folk circles in other forms as well, and Pete Seeger published a variant with a more explicitly political message, called \"If You Want To Go To Freedom\", in the mimeographed-but-influential Broadside Magazine in 1963. The original strain of \"Blood-Stained Banders\" is still played; Bobby Horton recorded it in 2003 with an extended guitar part, as part of the soundtrack for the Ken Burns documentary Horatio's Drive. A manuscript of Mary Hazzard of the New Lebanon, New York, Shaker community records this original version of the melody: The song resembles, to a slight extent, several repetitions of the opening measures of William Byrd's renaissance composition, \"The Barley Break\", which Byrd intended to imitate country children playing a folk game. 2, by Giovanni Gabrieli (c.1555-1612).

As the industry is becoming more sophisticated, the focus on innovation is increasing. Many more projects are at early stages of development, including those related to dengue, chikungunya and cholera. Majority of manufacturers from India export their vaccines to UN agencies. Most of the manufacturers are WHO prequalified for such supplies. The current government has taken good initiativesÂ for introduction of rotavirus, measles rubella and pneumococcal vaccines in EPI schedules. These vaccines are relatively costly but will boost the domestic market significantly. We also observe the urban population opting for vaccinations for flu, pneumococcal and HPV for their children. The market remains small (currently accounts for less than 2 per cent of the global market) and underpenetrated compared to the developed countries. What are the key innovations happening in the sector? How modern technology is aiding them? Newer technologies and enhanced scientific knowledge are enabling companies to differentiate traditionally commoditised products. However, sectors like bioservices and bioinformatics are service oriented sectors. These sectors will be important targets for start-ups and promotion of entrepreneurships.

To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. The New York Times disagreed, and wrote that free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages. The impact of offshore outsourcing, according to two estimates published by The Economist showed unequal effect during the period studied 2004 to 2015, ranging from 150,000 to as high as 300,000 jobs lost per year. In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country. Their data indicated that 140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return. Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S. The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. Just as the U.S. has a \"Made in U.S.A.\" program, other countries support products made in their countries as well. Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster. The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output. New factories often: Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 US presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs. Deloitte's survey identified three trends:\n\nLow-skilled work: Outsourced low-skilled work to contractors who tend to employ migrant labor is causing a revival of radical trade union activity. In the UK, major hospitals, universities, ministries and corporations are being pressured; outsourced workers often earn minimum wage and lack sick pay, annual leave, pensions and other entitlements enjoyed by directly employed staff at the same workplaces. ; USA base: On June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand. From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of globalization and economic polarization.\n\nQuestion: factories that assemble parts made in other countries\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Paul warns us about exactly this in Galatians 1. So what was this potentially cancerous error that the Galatians were being taught? And what is the true gospel we should cling to instead? It would seem there were teachers Galatia telling the new believers that in order to be saved they had to follow the Jewish laws, including the practice of circumcision. Paul makes clear in his letter to the Ephesians all that is required for salvation – it is by grace alone, through faith alone. Jesus handled it all on the cross. Nor do we follow the rules in order to gain added blessings, as prosperity preachers might lead you to believe. The Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament. It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of \n\n needlessly.\" A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), \"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\" The same exclusive claims for the Christian message are also made by other \n\n in line with Judaism of ca. Several passages from Paul, such as Rom. According to Richard B. Hays, who initiated the \"Pistis Christou debate,\" a different reading of these passages is also possible. The phrase pistis Christou can be translated as 'faith in Christ', that is, \n\n Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire. This may mean that Galatians at the time were already bilingual in Greek, as St. Jerome later reports. However, scholars are divided as to whether Paul was writing to Greek Galatians or to the Hellenized descendants of the Celtic Galatians. Lucian of Samosata recorded in circa AD 180 that the prophet Alexander of Abonoteichus was able to find Celtic-speaking interpreters for his oracles in Paphlagonia (immediately northeast of Galatia). The physician Galen of Pergamon in the late 2nd century AD complained that the commonly spoken Greek of his day was being corrupted by borrowings of foreign words from languages such as Galatian. In the 4th century St. Jerome (Hieronymus) wrote in a comment to Paul the Apostle's Epistle to the Galatians that \"apart from the Greek language, which is spoken throughout the entire East, the Galatians have their own language, almost the same as the Treveri\".\n\nQuestion: who is the book of galatians written to\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Oresteia trilogy concentrated on humans' position in the cosmos relative to the gods and divine law and divine punishment. Aeschylus' popularity is evident in the praise that the comic playwright Aristophanes gives him in The Frogs, produced some 50 years after Aeschylus' death. Aeschylus appears as a character in the play and claims, at line 1022, that his Seven against Thebes \"made everyone watching it to love being warlike\". Aeschylus goes on to say, at lines 1039ff., that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous. Many authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred. Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who defined, in many ways, lyric poetry as a genre. A playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. In doing so, he essentially invented \"drama\": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex. His Oresteia is the only extant ancient example. Aeschylus (, ; Aiskhylos, ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, and is often described as the father of tragedy. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, Prometheus Bound, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion.\n\nQuestion: who wrote antigone and what are the dates of his birth and death\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His \"salvation history\" stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of \"the Law and the Prophets\" (Luke 16:16), the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5–3:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the Kingdom of God was preached (Luke \n\n he relates it three times).

Furthermore, Acts does not include any account of a struggle between Christians and the Roman government as a result of the latter's imperial cult. The New Testament's Acts of the Apostles (the historical accuracy of which is questioned) and Epistle to the Galatians record that an early Jewish Christian community centered on Jerusalem, and that its leaders reportedly included Peter, James, the brother of Jesus, and John the Apostle.

The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised messiah.

PI is a growing category of over 350 forms of rare, genetic deficiencies of the immune system, increasing one’s susceptibility to a wide range of infections that can be life-threatening and affect different parts of the body including the skin, ears, lungs, intestines. Celebrated for the first time in 2010, the global disease awareness campaign World PI Week gathers patients and patient organisations, families, healthcare professionals, scientists, industry and policy-makers on all continents to enhance the understanding and political recognition of these rare diseases. The 2018 edition starts today and focuses on early testing and diagnosis of PI, which are crucial first steps for a successful care pathway and management of these diseases, estimated to affect over six million people worldwide. On World PI Week, the PI community encourages healthcare authorities, payers, healthcare professionals, patients and the general public to engage and establish a policy framework to drive greater public awareness of PI and education both among primary and specialist care providers, to develop better diagnostic facilities, ensure an improved availability of screening tests for healthcare providers and guarantee equal, universal patient access to them.

The awards include $50.5 million for state-of-the-art training equipment and technology, such as e-learning tools, video, audio and interactive learning systems and simulators. The grants include $88.7 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \"Today's awards not only will provide more training opportunities for people interested in a health professions career, but also will support equipment purchases and faculty development to expand and enhance the quality of training.\" \"With an aging and increasingly diverse population, we need to prepare our health professionals to meet the challenges of providing healthcare in the 21st century,\" said Mary K. Wakefield, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which oversees the programs. \"This includes ensuring diversity in the workforce, and that well-trained professionals practice in areas of severe need.\" Funding will target workforce development programs for pre- and post-doctoral training for dental residents; dental faculty; loan repayment for faculty who teach primary care dentistry; and training for practicing dentists, or other approved dental trainees in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene programs. Funding also includes $4.3 million to states to provide nine new grantees the opportunity to address their states' unique oral health workforce needs in underserved urban and rural areas. Grants are designed to strengthen the delivery of multidisciplinary comprehensive oral health care, integral to quality primary care. Funding from the Recovery Act will provide 208 awards to assist with purchasing equipment for training current and future health professionals across disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and post- graduate education levels. Twenty-nine grants will be made to states that provide matching funds to assist health professionals in repaying their educational loans. In return, these individuals agree to provide full-time primary health services in federal health professional shortage areas for a minimum of two years. Three grantees will receive funding to increase diversity in the health professions by developing an educational pipeline to enhance the academic performance of economically and educationally disadvantaged students, and prepare them for careers in the health professions. Funding will support 10 grants for patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention programs, typically supported by healthcare information technology, to develop and operate patient navigator services that improve healthcare outcomes for individuals with cancer or other chronic diseases, with specific emphasis on health disparity populations. Grant recipients recruit, train, and employ patient navigators with direct knowledge of the communities they serve to coordinate care for patients with chronic illnesses.

Peter Chiarelli (ret. ), UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, Ann Brown, medical center director of VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Operation Mend staff and patients look on as U.S. Army CPL (ret.) UCLA Operation Mend Launches New Program for Wounded Veterans Newswise — Veterans suffering from mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder — as well as their families — now have access to highly individualized, intensive treatment that draws on UCLA’s nationally recognized expertise in neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and integrative medicine. A new mental health program provided by UCLA Operation Mend is designed to heal the hidden, yet lingering, wounds of war. UCLA Operation Mend launched the program today with a ribbon-cutting at the UCLA Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. The expanded offerings are part of a new national network called Warrior Care Network, which is funded in part by Wounded Warrior Project. \"The percentage of those returning home from post-9/11 conflicts with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress is staggering,\" said retired Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, an executive advisor to the Ronald A. Katz Center for Collaborative Military Medicine at UCLA and the former vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army. \"The addition of this program to the Operation Mend portfolio makes UCLA the civilian leader in providing needed care to post-9/11 veterans. If every institution were doing the same, we could satisfy the unmet needs of veterans and their families for this critical care. \"A major component is to include family members so they can learn how to understand their loved ones’ challenges. We also believe that it is important to help the veterans learn how to access and engage with their community resources. \"Prior to enrolling in Operation Mend, potential participants spend two to five days at UCLA consulting with specialists from various disciplines to ensure that the program will address their needs. Once the program begins, the veteran and family spend three weeks at UCLA receiving cognitive training for challenges related to symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury. All care, travel and accommodations are arranged for and provided at no cost to the patients and family members. \"Through highly personalized care focused on the needs of each individual veteran, the Operation Mend expansion will advance the care of wounded veterans and, in doing so, potentially create new standards for the treatment of brain injuries,\" said Dr. Thomas Strouse, professor of clinical psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and medical director of the Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA. The expansion of Operation Mend’s services is part of a first-of-its-kind initiative called Warrior Care Network that connects wounded veterans and their families with world-class, individualized mental health care. The Warrior Care Network includes three other programs based at academic medical centers — the Veterans Program at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, the Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital Home Base Program in Boston and the Road Home Program at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"Treating and serving our wounded veterans today requires a team effort,\" said John Roberts, warrior relations executive vice president of Wounded Warrior Project. \"WWP is proud to partner with UCLA and other leading medical centers to help ensure no veteran or family member is turned away from care and support. \"Wounded Warrior Project and Warrior Care Network partners are committing a total of $100 million over three years to fund the initiative, including $7.5 million each that the medical centers will contribute through their own fundraising efforts. \"As a veteran who served in Afghanistan, I have seen firsthand many of my military buddies and their families who are suffering as a result of these invisible wounds,\" said retired Army Spc. \"Operation Mend has been there for me and my family in so many ways over the years. \"The new mental health program operates under UCLA’s Semel Institute. Service members or their family members interested in learning more about the program or any of the health care services offered through UCLA Operation Mend can visit www.operationmend.ucla.edu or call 310-267-2251. Operation Mend was established in 2007 as a groundbreaking partnership among UCLA Health, the U.S. military and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2010, Operation Mend began offering advanced diagnostics and treatment planning for patients with symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury and PTSD. Through this cutting-edge initiative, WWP and its partners plan to serve thousands of wounded veterans and family members over the next three years. The mission of Wounded Warrior Project is to honor and empower Wounded Warriors. WWP’s purpose is to raise awareness and to enlist the public’s aid for the needs of injured service members, to help injured servicemen and women aid and assist each other, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to meet their needs. WWP is a national, nonpartisan organization headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. Newswise — The transition to the battlefield and back home again is a long and, at times, bumpy road for our war veterans. \"Voices of Student Veterans\" chronicles those sometimes long journeys home in a documentary drama about the transitions of student veterans returning to the Commonwealth and a college campus. Kentuckians around the state were able to hear these personal stories of service as a tour of this production travels to five of the state's public universities. \"Voices of Student Veterans\" was developed in 2010 as part of an interdisciplinary arts and creativity project at the University of Kentucky through a unique collaboration between the university's Department of Theatre, Veterans Resource Center and Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History.

One of the most consequential examples is early childhood education. He said those common challenges included the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons (which he said might not occur in his lifetime), nuclear proliferation, climate change, tolerance \"among people of different faiths and races and religions\", peace between and security for Israelis and Palestinians, better social conditions for the world's poor, including \"the ability to get an education and make a decent living; the security that you won't have to live in fear of disease or violence without hope for the future.\" The United States, he said, is \"a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary \n\nWhat's the Benefit of Earning Your Online Nursing Degree? Why Should I Earn a Nursing Degree Online? Whether earning an RN-to-BSN online or an RN-to-MSN online, RNs can advance their careers while maintaining their jobs. Online nursing programs give students the ability to access lectures and other course materials from anywhere, at any time, benefiting working nurses who may have limited time and resources. The rankings below list the most affordable RN-to-BSN programs in each of these states. Registered nurses working in California need look no further than CSUDH for an excellent, affordable RN-to-BSN program. A hybrid program, students' only on-campus obligation involves completing laboratory work for a single course. The synchronous curriculum takes full-time students two years to complete, while part-time students use the university's specialized three-year program. In-state students pay an extremely competitive tuition rate. Although out-of-state students pay higher tuition, CSUDH remains a competitive option compared to online RN-to-BSN programs at private colleges and universities. The hybrid RN-to-BSN program at Fresno State stresses community health, making it the perfect choice for RNs who plan to work in underserved areas. The synchronous curriculum starts with foundational coursework in nursing principles, theories, and best practices. The university also uses a specialized assessment system to ensure that students master topics the National Council Licensure Examination covers. Students must earn a minimum C grade in all courses to stay in good academic standing. A competitive program, Fresno State requires that all applicants possess a minimum 2.5 undergraduate GPA. At CSUN, students can earn an RN-to-BSN in California entirely online while completing all practicum requirements at their job sites. The required courses emphasize pathophysiology, family systems, and leadership. In addition to its low tuition for in-state students, CSUN also awards multiple merit- and need-based scholarships to deserving students. Like CSUDH, all new students must possess a valid California nursing license. Stan State's RN-BSN track boasts an advanced clinical practicum that sets the program apart from other California RN-to-BSN programs.

One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was Disney. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. Digital Video (or DV) has quickly changed how most films are made. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. A simplified two-color version, introduced as Kinemacolor in 1908, was marginally successful for a few years, but the special projector it required and its inherent major technical defects contributed to its demise in 1914. Technicolor, originally also a two-color process capable of only a limited range of hues, was commercialized in 1922 and soon became the most widely used of the several two-color processes available in the 1920s. Beginning in 1932, Technicolor introduced a new full-color process, \"Process 4\", now commonly called \"three-strip Technicolor\" because the special camera used for live-action filming yielded separate black-and-white negatives for each of the three primary colors. The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was Walt Disney's Flowers and Trees (1932), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s. No special projection equipment was needed.\n\nQuestion: when did movies start coming out in color\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. While visibility is low due to the alternating fog and darkness, all of the series' player characters, except Henry Townshend of Silent Hill 4: The Room, are equipped with a flashlight and a portable device which warns the player of nearby monsters by emitting static (a transistor radio in Origins and the first three installments, a walkie-talkie in Homecoming and Downpour, and a mobile phone in Shattered Memories).

The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information. Dendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. Neurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons. In summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. They transmit information through electrical signals along the axon, receive signals through dendrites, and communicate with other neurons through synapses. This intricate system facilitates the transmission of various types of information, including sensory input and motor output, ultimately allowing for the functioning of the nervous system. There are several types of nerve cells, also known as neurons, in the human body, each with its specific functions. Some of the main types include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. They gather information from various sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, skin, and nose, and transmit it to the central nervous system for processing. Examples of sensory neurons include those involved in vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Motor Neurons: Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands, allowing for voluntary and involuntary movements and controlling bodily functions. Interneurons: Interneurons, also known as association neurons, form connections between sensory and motor neurons. These are just a few examples of nerve cell types and their general functions. However, it's important to note that the nervous system is incredibly complex, and there are many more specialized types of neurons with unique roles and functions in different areas of the body. Neurons are polarised cells that are specialised for the conduction of action potentials also called nerve impulses. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. Some of the functional properties of the brain include information processing, motor control, sensory perception, memory storage and retrieval, emotions, and cognitive functions. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. Neurons also form networks and systems within the brain. Overall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain.\n\nQuestion: dendrites and cell bodies are components of what type of matter found in the brain\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 ft while its towers, at 746 ft above the water, were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1993 when it was surpassed by the Mezcala Bridge, in Mexico. The weight of the roadway is hung from 250 pairs of vertical suspender ropes, which are attached to two main cables. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4200 ft between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964.

Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated. The USPS has a monopoly on \"letter\" delivery within the United States and operates under a universal service obligation (USO), both of which are defined across a broad set of legal mandates, which obligate it to provide uniform price and quality across the entirety of its service area. the United States but is part of the Government, and so is not controlled by the antitrust laws\" such as the Sherman Antitrust Act. Unlike a state-owned enterprise, the USPS lacks a transparent ownership structure and isn't subject to standard rules and norms that apply to commercial entities. National Postal, telegraph and telephone service monopolies were enforced in many countries until the late 20th century. Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia. As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters.

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Included on the album is the now classic “Angels of Fenway,” a tribute to the Boston Red Sox World Series championship season in 2004.

By then, the song was already causing a stir. Brooks told a reporter from USA Today in October 1990, when the song was still at its chart peak, that he had received letters from high school students saying that they wanted to use \"Friends in Low Places\" as their \"class song,\" only to have it opposed by their principals because the song is about \n\n as a solo during a breast-cancer care show. Her solo version was an acoustic ballad with several lyrics changed, such as \"you've gotta get with my friends\" being changed to \"you've gotta be my best friend\". In 2016, American actress Eva Longoria performed a comedic dramatic reading of \"Wannabe\" in honour of the 20th anniversary of the album Spice. For the 21st anniversary of the song in July 2017, W magazine had various celebrities perform \"Wannabe\", including Nicole Kidman, James Franco, Riz Ahmed, Milo Ventimiglia, Millie Bobby Brown and Keri Russell. Schlitz' first hit as a songwriter was Kenny Rogers's \"The Gambler\", which became a crossover country hit upon its release in 1978, later becoming one of Rogers's signature songs. Among his biggest hits are two Number One songs which he co-wrote with Paul Overstreet, \"Forever and Ever, Amen\" by Randy Travis and \"When You Say Nothing at All\" by Keith Whitley. 3 country hit for Randy Travis in 1991. Rogers also recorded several more of his songs in 2013 for his best-selling You Can't Make Old Friends album. In addition to the title song for 9to5, she also recorded a second version of \"I Will Always Love You\" for The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). \"I Will Always Love You\" has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on Prisoner In Disguise (1975), Kenny Rogers on Vote for Love (1996), and LeAnn Rimes on Unchained Melody: The Early Years (1997).

Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight. On the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition. The integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms. Plant stems have a variety of functions. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage. dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, \n\n In botany, a plant shoot consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds. Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy. Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. The epithelium in all birds and animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature. It serves functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. Epithelial tissues help in elimination of waste. They form growing parts at the apices of roots and stems and are responsible for increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ. Lateral Meristem - This meristem consist of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth. Intercalary Meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. It is usually present at the base of node, inter node and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode, They result in branch formation and growth. Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. In some situations, a parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. Some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of lignin. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. The entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of epidermis. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. Xylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\n\nQuestion: what are the main functions of the stem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Thomas is also the author of The Campbell Plan and The China Study Solution. 1440: You wrote The Campbell Plan as a practical follow-up to The China Study. Thomas: There’s not a single study that I rely on, but rather a broad collection of research that suggests that nutrition is far more important than many people realize. Moderation is a vague term that means different things to different people. 1440: What is the biggest nutritional concern you hear from patients and readers? Thomas: One of the biggest concerns tends to be a variety of questions related to “getting enough” of x, y, z. Don’t I need more fat for my brain? 1440: What is the most dangerous nutritional trend that you observe in modern life? In the extreme, these might be a ketogenic type of diet, and there may be short-term benefits, but I have very serious concerns about long-term effects of diets high in meat and fat. There is a terribly confusing mess of nutrition information in the popular media. 1440: Sugar. Alcohol. Caffeine. If all are enjoyed in moderation, is one of these any more damaging than the others? Thomas: From a nutritional/health concern, it’s probably true that anything in very small amounts is likely fine, but my concern is more of a behavioral one. From a health point of view, I think alcohol and caffeine in small amounts are okay, but dosing yourself regularly with sugary foods is a recipe for dietary trouble. injection (which is the basis of lethal injection in the context of capital punishment). This resulted in 98,000 deaths worldwide, down from 120,000 deaths in 1990. Of increasing concern since the isolation of natural radium by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898—and the subsequent advent of nuclear physics and nuclear technologies—are radiological poisons. These are associated with ionizing radiation, a mode of toxicity quite distinct from chemically active poisons.

Intravenous injection of an unnaturally high concentration of potassium chloride, such as in the execution of prisoners in parts of the United States, quickly stops the heart by eliminating the cell potential necessary for muscle contraction. Most biocides, including pesticides, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms (secondary poisoning), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as \"harmful\" (EU). Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by \n\nYou have heard it again and again: Adapt to a healthy lifestyle. You walk out with another prescription, whether it is to help lower your cholesterol, control your blood pressure or fight off an infection. Sometimes you are warned to take the meds on an empty stomach or to take them with food. While some people may stick to these directions, others may ignore them. Did you know that many drugs can negatively interact with many of the daily foods you eat? I’m not just talking about one of those uncomfortable side effects such as a headache. When you consume certain foods at the same time as your medications, it is possible that the foods alter the way the meds work. The foods can either increase the effect of the meds, making it more “bioavailable” and therefore toxic, or decrease their effects. Elderly patients are at increased risk of any negative food-drug interactions since more than 30% of prescription medications are common in this population. The following is a list of common interactions in which scientific studies have shown how foods play a strong role in their effects within your body. At least 43 of these medications can have serious effects and may even result in death. Therefore the drug is not properly broken down, allowing excess amounts to be released into the bloodstream leading to toxic and debilitating effects on your health. Combining these foods can have adverse effects and may even be life-threatening. Studies suggest that tyramine may slow down the metabolism of these drugs, leading to a dangerous increase in high blood pressure. While this isn’t a food-drug interaction, it is important to emphasize that alternative therapies also play a strong role in changing the way your body metabolizes medications. Many people fail to mention to their doctors any supplements, natural health products and alternative therapies they may be using; however, these can have dire consequences. For example, when writing an email, your brain will signal to your hands to type out the email; however, with a lack of dopamine, these signals are never transmitted and your ability to carry out these physical actions are halted. Unfortunately, protein competes with Levadopa absorption and protein usually wins. However, it can also get quite tricky to determine the amount of medication the doctor should prescribe as well. By taking too much, you’ll be overactive, but too little can leave you paralyzed, with it taking at least 20 minutes for your dose to kick in and stabilize you. It’s not easy to figure out what foods can be consumed while taking certain medications, as well as the timing of such foods. Make sure that you always check with your doctor or pharmacist, and consider speaking with a dietitian in order to determine which foods to avoid, limit or redistribute to optimize the effects of your medications—and keep you at your best.\n\nQuestion: who said the poison is in the dose\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In thick skin, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum is present between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. These processes form intercellular bridges with neighboring cells, contributing to the overall strength and integrity of the skin. On the surface of the skin is the stratum corneum, which is composed of fully keratinized cells. In thick skin, such as the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum can be observed between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. It's important to note that the epidermis also contains other cell types, including melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells. From the basal layer to the outermost layer, the epidermis consists of keratinocytes that produce keratin, form intercellular bridges, and provide a water barrier. The epidermis also contains other cell types like melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells, which contribute to the skin's color, immune response, and sensory perception. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells. The epidermis of the body, very sensitive and delicate, reacts almost immediately to most outside effects. People whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the Equator generally have more active melanocytes, \n\nScattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker.It serves many important functions, including regulating body temperature, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and sensing painful and pleasant stimuli. Anything that interferes with skin function or causes changes in appearance can have important consequences for physical and mental health. Structure and Function\n\nThe skin has three layers—the epidermis, dermis, and fat layer (also called the subcutaneous layer). Epidermis: The epidermis is the relatively thin, tough, outer layer of the skin. Most of the cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. They originate from cells in the deepest layer of the epidermis called the basal layer. The outermost portion of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is relatively waterproof and, when undamaged, prevents most bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis (along with other layers of the skin) also protects the internal organs, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels against trauma. In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.Getting Under the Skin\n\nThe skin has three layers.Beneath the surface of the skin are nerves, nerve endings, glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels.The epidermis also contains Langerhans' cells, which are part of the skin's immune system.Although these cells help detect foreign substances and defend the body against infection, they also play a role in the development of skin allergies.\n\nQuestion: the outer layer of the skin that contains no blood or nerve supply is the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the spring we took Ivy to an infectious disease doctor, Dr Russ Osgathorpe. When we went, Ivy had just finished an episode two days before. During the Christmas break, she had an episode. Our next step is to get her tonsils and adenoids removed. There is an 80% chance of a cure- which seems like pretty good odds- especially now that we are comfortable with her diagnosis. She has the mouth ulcers as well & now that I know about PFAPA and have been reading up on it - I feel it describes her syndrome well. Ivy had her tonsils out and we went 5 months without a fever. It is amazing how much she has changed since she had her tonsils out. She has more energy and she's enjoying everything more than she ever did before. We opted for the risk, the procedure went smoothly and we're still glad we did it. As parents, we tried to stay as natural as possible, and don't believe in surgery unless absolutely necessary. We had his tonsils out, and the change has been so incredible. Of the 13 kids having no further episodes, 12 had had surgery. Patrick- thank you so much for your comment. It is surprising how well it works. She is happier and more bubbly. Our middle daughter is being checked for this. She is also being tested for TRAPS. Surgery is out for us because she also has Ehlers Danlos - Hypermobility Type. Her fevers are farther apart and not so high (we were at 106 in the beginning, now they don't go any farther than 102.5). I'm pretty confident hers is starting to come to the end. She's a tough little cookie. Missed a ton of school but is an A student. I have no idea how she does it.

She was previously engaged to then boyfriend Ricky on Season 11 of Geordie Shore, but then broke it off & returned to the show in Season 12.

Fifty Shades Freed Fifty Shades Freed is the third movie in the \"Fifty Shades\" phenomenon. To begin, Fifty Shades Freed was shot consecutively with its predecessor Fifty Shades Darker which helped the production combine and reuse materials. The film is the first installment in The Divergent Series and was produced by Lucy Fisher, Pouya Shahbazian, and Douglas Wick, with a screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor. It stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, and Kate Winslet. Beatrice Prior is warned that she is Divergent and thus will never fit into any one of the factions. Development of Divergent began in March 2011 when Summit \n\n by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs, and starring Gal Gadot. The film was released in June 2017 and gave Jenkins the biggest domestic opening for a female director, surpassing previous record holder Fifty Shades of Grey by Sam Taylor-Johnson. This film helped Jenkins become admired by critics and liked by fans and audiences. This movie grossed over $800 million worldwide, exceeding box office original predictions on how the film would perform in theaters. Principal photography began April 16, 2013, and concluded on July 16, 2013, with reshoots taking place from January 24–26, 2014. The film received mixed reviews: although its action sequences and performances, notably Woodley's, were praised, critics deemed its execution and handling of its themes to be generic and unoriginal, and compared it unfavorably to other young adult fiction adaptations. The film grossed $288 million worldwide against its budget of $85 million.\n\nQuestion: who played in the first fifty shades of grey\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lethal injection was introduced in 1978 as a gentler alternative to the historic methods of execution: electrocution, gassing, hanging and shooting. Thailand has adopted lethal injection as its sole method, to replace shooting from October 2003, and carried out its first executions in December 2003 when 4 men were put to death in Bang Khwang prison for drug trafficking and murder. In 2002, the constitutionality of lethal injection was challenged in the case of State of Georgia v. A lethal injection chamber has been constructed within the Pavón Rehabilitation Prison, and according to Salvador Gándara, Deputy Interior Minister, all the necessary chemicals have been acquired and one or more executioners have been recruited. Since its introduction in 1982, death by lethal injection has largely swept aside execution methods such as the electric chair and the gallows, spreading to all but one of the 38 states that practise capital punishment. One was quoted as saying : \"With lethal injection, only 4 people are required to execute the death penalty: one executioner, one member of the court, one from the procuratorate and one forensic doctor. Authorizes lethal injection for those whose capital offenses occurred on or after 3/25/94; those who committed the offense before that date may select lethal injection or lethal gas. Advocates and prison officials would say that lethal injection takes ten minutes or less to kill, once the needle is inserted. Ronald Reagan advocated lethal injection in 1973, comparing it to \"putting a horse to sleep.\" In 1977 Oklahoma became the first state to adopt lethal injection. The Death With Dignity Act provides fairly stringent safeguards to curb possible abuses: The request for the lethal drugs must be made in writing, the patient must be mentally competent, and two physicians must agree that he or she has less than six months left. Oklahoma was the first state to adopt lethal injection in 1977, but Texas was the first to carry out such an execution five years later. \"Lethal Injection is not humane nor \"painless\" as death penalty advocates claim. Lethal injection is\n\n No executions have occurred in the United Kingdom since the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act. The last were on 13 August 1964, when Peter Allen and Gwynne Evans were hanged for murdering John Alan West during a theft four months earlier, a death penalty crime under the 1957 act. The 1965 act left four capital offences: high treason, \"piracy with violence\" (piracy with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm), arson in royal dockyards and espionage, as well as other capital offences under military law. During the Troubles Westminster passed the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, abolishing Stormont, and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, abolishing the death penalty for murder there. The death penalty was not fully abolished in the United Kingdom until 1998 by the Human Rights Act and the Crime and Disorder Act. Amendments to the Criminal Code in 2011 permit the judge to impose consecutive parole ineligibility periods for first or second-degree murders committed as part of the same \"transaction\" (or as part of the same series of offences). One of the first cases where the new sentencing provisions were used was a multiple murder in Edmonton, Alberta of three armoured car guards by one of their co-workers. The perpetrator in that case was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years - 25 years for one \n\n In November 2007, Canada's minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy. In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\" Among democratic countries around the world, all European (except Belarus) and Latin American states, many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and Timor Leste), and Canada have abolished capital punishment, while the majority of the United States, Guatemala, and most of the Caribbean as well as some democracies in Asia (e.g., Japan and India) and Africa (e.g., Botswana and Zambia) retain it.

The impetus for Germany's involvement in WW1 was its alliance with Austria-Hungary who declared war on Serbia on the 28th of July 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The alliance system of WW1 pitted the Centrals Powers, encompassing Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria against the Allied Powers which compromised Russia, France, Great Britain and the United States. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (June 1914) was used as an excuse for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia, leading to World War I. As a further expression of that hope, upon the conclusion of the war, the League of Nations was formed. Its primary aim was to prevent war, as all signatories to the League of Nations Covenant were required to agree to desist from the initiation of all wars, preemptive or otherwise. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed \n\n  Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century.

This can have significant impacts on air quality and can contribute to the formation of acid rain. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and when these fossil fuels are burned, sulfur dioxide is released into the air. Industrial activities such as power generation, manufacturing, and transportation all contribute to sulfur dioxide emissions. The environmental concerns associated with sulfur dioxide stem from its effects on human health and ecosystems. In addition to its direct health effects, sulfur dioxide plays a role in the formation of acid rain. When SO2 reacts with oxygen and other pollutants in the atmosphere, it can form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Acid rain occurs when this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, causing harm to plants, aquatic life, and infrastructure. The combustion process of petroleum, coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. For example, acid rain can kill trees, and can kill fish by acidifying lakes. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3).

Early in 1483, the king and queen established a council, the Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición, to govern the inquisition and chose Torquemada to head it as inquisitor general. After the 1400s, few Spanish inquisitors were from the religious orders. The Portuguese inquisition was also fully controlled by the crown which established a government board, known as the General Council, to oversee it.

The figure of \n\n With the institution of the Roman Catholic Inquisition in Spain, and with the Dominican friar Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General, the Catholic Monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity. Though Isabella opposed taking harsh measures against Jews on economic grounds, Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand. On 31 March 1492, the Alhambra decree for the expulsion of the Jews was issued. Hundreds of those that remained came under the Inquisition's investigations into relapsed conversos (Marranos) and the Judaizers who had been abetting them. In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-fé in which an effigy of him was burned. Reina wrote the first great book against the Inquisition: Sanctae Inquisitionis hispanicae artes aliquot detectae, ac palam traductae (\"Some arts of Holy Inquisition\"). The most dedicated defenders of the Moriscos were the Valencian and Aragonese nobility, as their self-interest was involved.

Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth.

Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication.

Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices.

In the first phase, CCMR enabled the company to work with a Cornell Chemistry expert who synthesized the reagents necessary to conduct the assay. In a follow-up project, the company used CCMR’s high-resolution transmission electron microscope to study the size and detailed structure of the polymer nanoparticles, which contain the metal catalyst necessary for the signal amplification reaction. The company benefited from the help of two Cornell experts and from CCMR matching funds to develop a test method for evaluating new and existing foam ear cuffs used on its products. In collaboration with the CCMR, a hand-decorated cookie company based in Syracuse has doubled its production after developing a fast-drying frosting. A startup focusing on commercializing biological assays to detect hard-to-discern infectious diseases developed a test using Raman spectroscopy with the help of CCMR experts. Using the CCMR Raman and the expertise of a Cornell Materials scientist, the company tested the effects of varying conditions and morphology of their nanostructured metal surfaces and the resulting enhancement of the Raman signal produced in presence of the molecule of interest. Within a year of CCMR partnering the company with two Cornell fiber scientists in the College of Human Ecology, a startup originally from New York State was able to create the first prototype of a wearable ultrasonic pain therapy device. A leading local manufacturer of optics and accessories for IR-UV-VIS (infrared-ultraviolet-visible light) spectroscopy was partnered with a Cornell physics professor to develop a prototype shear/compression attachment that allows users of optical microscopes to examine biological tissues in response to applied forces. This causes rescuers to get a major jolt of static electricity when they hit the water or the ground holding the cable, unless they get the cable end to hit the ground first—not always easy to arrange in a crisis situation. It partnered a small business, based in Lansing, NY, and a Cornell mechanical engineering professor to develop a safer alternative to the steel cables currently being used in rescue helicopters. Having secured long-term funding from the NAVY, the team is developing a non-conductive cable made of polymer fibers that will also be stronger, lighter and less likely to cause hand injuries that divers receive from broken wires. An Ithaca-based company, which specializes in intelligent sensor systems that detect icing conditions on aircraft and ground vehicles, is diversifying its product line. Working with a Cornell fiber scientist in the College of Human Ecology, the company created a fiber-reinforced tape that simplifies aviation repairs. The idea for the coating draws its inspiration from the miniscule ridges of lotus leaves, which prevent water from bonding and icing. The company focused on fabricating highly efficient antimicrobial nanocoatings on a natural cellulose substrate. A medium-size company has been partnered with two Cornell faculty members with expertise in fiber science and chemical engineering to use light- and stress-sensing dyes that will alter the appearance of its harnesses when the nylon it is made out of has been compromised by the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays or stress. The project is moving beyond the proof-of-concept phase. Patches containing these UV-sensitive and stress sensing dyes for the company’s nylon safety harnesses will provide an immediate warning to the user. An energy-focused startup located in California collaborated with a Cornell chemical engineering expert to develop a scalable gas-assisted electrospinning manufacturing process for energy storage materials. Further optimization led to an electrospray process that could be used in nanocoatings, sensor-making, and many other applications, opening up a wide variety of markets for the startup. An established industry leader in vacuum coating with international partners in Europe, and Asia, developed a new physical vapor deposition (PVD) process to replace the toxic electroplated chromium coating process for applications on plastic substrates from automobiles to appliances. A Cornell faculty enabled the company to study each step of its PVD process and overcome process variabilities helping the company finalize\n\nArtificial skin is a collagen scaffold that induces regeneration of skin in mammals such as humans. The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns. It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds. 'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs, (also experimental). The former approach has the disadvantage that there may not be enough skin available, while the latter suffers from the possibility of rejection or infection. Until the late twentieth century, skin grafts were constructed from the patient's own skin. Regenerated skin: discovery and clinical use A process for inducing regeneration in skin was invented by Dr. Ioannis V. Yannas (then an assistant professor in the Fibers and Polymers Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Dr. John F. Burke (then chief of staff at Shriners Burns Institute in Boston, Massachusetts). Their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure. By the late 1970s it was evident that the original objective was not reached. In 1981 Burke and Yannas proved that their artificial skin worked on patients with 50 to 90 percent burns, vastly improving the chances of recovery and improved quality of life. John F. Burke also claimed, in 1981, \"[The Artificial skin] is soft and pliable, not stiff and hard, unlike other substances used to cover burned-off skin.\" U.S. Patent 4,418,691 (December 6, 1983) was cited by the National Inventors Hall of Fame as the key patent describing the invention of a process for regenerated skin (Inductees Natl. Inventors Hall of Fame, 2015). These patents were later translated into a commercial product by Integra LifeSciences Corp., a company founded in 1989. Since then, it has been applied worldwide to treat patients who are in need of new skin to treat massive burns and traumatic skin wounds, those undergoing plastic surgery of the skin, as well as others who suffer from certain forms of skin cancer. Although early versions of the scaffold were not capable of regenerating hair follicles and sweat glands, later developments by S.T Boyce and coworkers led to solution of this problem. The Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology is working towards a fully automated process for producing artificial skin. Hanna Wendt, and a team of her colleagues in the Department of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical School Hannover Germany, have found a method for creating artificial skin using spider silk. Before this, however, artificial skin was grown using materials like collagen. These materials did not seem strong enough. Instead, Wendt and her team turned to spider silk, which is known to be 5 times stronger than Kevlar. The steel frame was 0.7 mm thick, and the resulting weave was easy to handle or sterilize. Australian researchers are currently searching for a new, innovative way to produce artificial skin. This would produce artificial skin more quickly and in a more efficient way.

Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first match, where the replacement players did not need to be in the preliminary squad. For players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May. Initially the preliminary squads were to have 30 players but, in February 2018, it was announced that the number of players to be named in the provisional squads \n\n Initially, the first stage was disputed by 29 teams divided by five groups of four and three groups of three.

In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. This blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.The contraction of the left ventricle propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. The left side pumps blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen and nutrients are delivered to tissues and waste products (such as carbon dioxide) are transferred to the blood for removal by other organs (such as the lungs and kidneys). Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Here, the blood absorbs oxygen and gives up carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.) Its inferior surface lies over the central tendon of the diaphragm. The circulatory system delivers oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to and from the heart through a series of blood vessels. The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. The deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and then flows into the right ventricle. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. As the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. This exchange of gases and nutrients occurs due to the thin walls of the capillaries. Once the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins.\n\nQuestion: where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750. In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as \"Lipman's Postal Card\". These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability. His best known work involved the designing of Christmas cards for UNICEF and the New York Graphic Society, which gave him international recognition. The cards were designed starting in 1963 and achieved record sales for the United Nations’ children's \n\n back.

In the mid-1930s, work began on an airship designed specifically to operate a passenger service across the Atlantic. The Hindenburg (LZ 129) completed a successful 1936 season, carrying passengers between Lakehurst, New Jersey and Germany. Approaching the Lakehurst mooring mast minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the Hindenburg suddenly burst into flames and crashed to the ground. Of the 97 people aboard, 36 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, and one American ground-crewman. The metal structure of the Zeppelin was dragged by Allied soldiers from the swamps to the White Tower of Thessaloniki. There it was reconstructed so that Allied engineers could study how the Germans built airships. Despite the rising wind, Bockholt ordered the airship to be removed from the hangar, which almost always ended in disaster due to strong gusts of wind. Bockholt decided to wait out the impending storm in the air, but he delayed the start waiting for food and warm clothes to be delivered aboard the airship. Just before midnight, a strong gust of wind hit the airship, damaging it. About 40 minutes after midnight, the wind decreased sufficiently that \n\n The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States.

The pair do not wear traditional wedding attire and Marsh did not think it made their marriage look \n\n Her first marriage was to The Donna Reed Show actor Paul Petersen in 1967. In 1969, Benet left Petersen for actor Bill Bixby. After her divorce from Petersen became final, she married Bixby in 1971. After the divorce and until her death, Benet was in a relationship with future pundit Tammy Bruce. Her role on Days of Our Lives made her extremely unpopular with fans; Benet's character was breaking up one of the show's popular couples, Doug and Julie, and fans were outraged. Producers created Janae's first romantic partnership alongside Boyd. Boyd's father Max Hoyland (Stephen Lovatt) does not approve because of their young age. Marsh told an Inside Soap reporter that the engagement causes tension between the Timmins and Hoylands because Max thinks Janae is not good enough for his son.

Billboard Magazine described the song as \"fiery rock 'n' roll that continues in intensity throughout\" while containing \"serious lyric content\" from the singer/songwriter's \"identifiable gritty vocal\". With its number 11 peak on the Hot 100 in Spring 1978, \"Running on Empty\" was Browne's third-biggest hit single in his career (trailing only \"Doctor My Eyes\" and \"Somebody's Baby\"), and subsequently became his most-played song on classic rock radio formats. For their second album, the members of Journey toned down the overt progressiveness of their first, self-titled release, in favor of a more focused approach. The album also features a cover version of The Beatles' \"It's All Too Much\" from the 1968 Yellow Submarine film and 1969 soundtrack. Guitarist George Tickner left the band after having co-written two songs for this album, leaving members Gregg Rolie (lead vocals/keyboards), Neal Schon (guitar), Ross Valory (bass), and Aynsley Dunbar (drums).

In terms of composition, the interstitial fluid consists of various substances that are necessary for the functioning of cells and tissues. It contains nutrients, oxygen, hormones, electrolytes, and waste products. These substances are exchanged between the blood and the cells through the capillary walls. The interstitial fluid compartment is approximately 12 liters in volume, while the total ECF compartment is around 14-15 liters. It's important to note that the interstitial fluid compartment is further divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment and the transcellular fluid compartment. To summarize, the interstitial fluid compartment is an essential component of the extracellular fluid compartment. It contains nutrients, oxygen, and waste products that are exchanged between the blood and the cells. Understanding the composition and dynamics of the interstitial fluid is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and overall health. In lean healthy adult men, the total body water is about 60% (60–67%) of the total body weight; it is usually slightly lower in women (52-55%). The exact percentage of fluid relative to body weight is inversely proportional to the percentage of body fat. The total body of water is divided into fluid compartments, between the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment (also called space, or volume) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (space, volume) in a two-to-one ratio: 28 (28–32) liters are inside cells and 14 (14–15) liters are outside cells. ; Integumentary system: skin, hair, fat, and nails. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. Carrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the \n\n of lymph between tissues and the blood stream; includes the lymph and the nodes and vessels. ; Immune system: protects the organism from foreign bodies. **Solutes** are the particles dissolved or suspended in the water.The **solvent** is the water portion of fluids.This water (fluid) is divided into two main spaces or compartments—the fluid outside the cells, which is the **extracellular fluid (ECF)** ; and the fluid inside the cells, which is the **intracellular fluid (ICF). ** The ECF space contains about one third (about 15 L) of the total body water. **Transcellular fluids** are the fluids in special body spaces and include cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid. In the healthy adult, the volume of water in the fluid compartments remains within the normal range although the water moves constantly between compartments. _For proper function, the volume of all body fluids and the types and amount of dissolved substances must be carefully balanced._\n\n# Anatomy and Physiology Review\n\n## Physiologic Influences on Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n\nBody fluids are composed of water and particles dissolved or suspended in water. Solutes vary in type and amount from one fluid space to another.Body function depends on keeping the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes within each body fluid space.Three processes are important to control normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and they work together to maintain balance so the internal environment remains stable even when the external environment changes.These processes are filtration, diffusion, and osmosis.\n\nQuestion: what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–1814 campaigns, resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Parton was honored in 2003 with a tribute album called Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton. The artists who recorded versions of Parton's songs included Melissa Etheridge (\"I Will Always Love You\"), Alison Krauss (\"9 to 5\"), Shania Twain (\"Coat of Many Colors\"), Meshell Ndegeocello (\"Two Doors Down\"), Norah Jones (\"The Grass is Blue\"), and Sinéad O'Connor (\"Dagger Through the Heart\"). Parton herself contributed a re-recording of the title song, originally the title song for her first RCA album in 1968. Parton was awarded the Living Legend \n\n The album's title track, \"Coat of Many Colors\", tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes,\" rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags.

The bonus track \"My Heart Started Breaking\" was later re-recorded and included on Parton's 1975 album, Dolly.

Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.

Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Being a woman in Zen was problematic from the start. This belief was not surprising. And though the feminism that emerged in the 1960s helped me see through these assumptions, I continued to struggle with them. It was hard for me to challenge the patriarchal culture that surrounded me; in some part of my deep unconscious mind, I carried the idea that I was less than a man. Still, I was determined to practice feminism and live a life of equality between men and women.

Being a woman in Zen was problematic from the start. I was a slow learner in this area, confused by his insistence on our potential sexual connection. Not only were both of us married but my husband was also one of his students! I found myself flattered by his attention, but I knew deep in my bones that the sort of relationship he wanted was not about the dharma. We see this old story of the objectification of women by the male patriarchy everywhere in history and in modern Western culture. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, and sad for many years. For me, retreating into the emptiness of gender was strongly appealing. In my life, this view became a lifeline I could use to help free me from the attention of my teacher’s sexual predation.

As Kłosowska describes, this sonnet participates in the tradition of courtly erotic joke making in which erotic meaning lies under the thin pretense of non-erotic solution; however, l'Aubespine's appropriation of the genre complicates the traditional gender standards of the time, because her sonnet is woman-centered and outlines mutual sexual gratification. In this way, l'Aubespine adapts the traditional form to her needs, and influences the French literary world.

Mid-ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. The basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. The resulting \"layer cake\" of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see fault-block). New magma steadily emerges onto the ocean floor and intrudes into the existing ocean crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle. The crystallized magma forms a new crust of basalt known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt, and gabbro below it in the lower oceanic crust. Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic \n\n Oceanic detachment faults occur at spreading ridges where magmatic activity is not enough to account for the entire plate spreading rate. They are characterized by long domes parallel to the spreading direction (oceanic core complexes of the footwall). They cannot be structurally restored, as slip on the fault exceeds the thickness of oceanic crust (~30 km compared to ~6 km, for example). This is in contrast to continental settings, where the mineralogy is dominantly quartz and feldspar. The footwall is also much more extensively hydrothermally altered than in continental settings. In contrast to many detachment faults in continental settings, oceanic detachment faults are usually rolling hinge normal faults, initiating at higher angles and rotating to low angles.\n\nQuestion: where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While The Great British Bake Off features three challenges per episode (signature, technical, and showstopper), Junior Bake Off includes only the technical and showstopper challenges. In the first four series, aired on CBBC from 2011–16, the format featured 40 young bakers aged 9 to 12 years old divided into 10 qualifying rounds or heats. Each episode featured only four bakers, with one winner each episode and the other three eliminated. The format was altered in 2019 when the series moved to Channel 4. The bakers are all given the same recipe, which is set by the judges, and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished product is ranked from worst to best, with the judges not knowing who produced which. The judges are looking for a bake that is both of a professional appearance but also in taste. The show consists of 10 episodes where in each episode the bakers are tasked with two different challenges; a signature bake and a technical bake or a technical bake and a showstopper. Unlike The Great British Bake Off, the bakers only face two challenges each episode, the bakes are then critically examined by the judges who will then choose a \"Star Baker\" and a baker to be eliminated from the competition.

Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage \"Dream Scene\", recorded several months before Lennon's \"Revolution 9\". In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. During the tour that included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to play slide guitar, and also began to write \"My Sweet Lord\", which became his first single as a solo artist. The Beatles taped the basic track for \"Come Together\" at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in Studio Three on 21 July 1969, during the sessions for Abbey Road. George Martin produced the session, assisted by balance engineers Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald. At McCartney's request, the session marked Emerick's first with the group since July 1968, having quit working with them during sessions for their 1968 album, The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"), due to what he found a tense and negative atmosphere. The session also marked Lennon's first new composition for the band in three months, having last recorded \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" \n\n Apple Records, the Beatles' EMI-distributed record label, released Abbey Road on 26 September 1969, with \"Come Together\" sequenced as the opening track. The first take of the song, recorded on 21 July 1969, with slightly different lyrics, was released in 1996 on the outtake compilation Anthology 3, and take five of the song was released on the Abbey Road 50th Anniversary release. Ono were on holiday in Denmark at the time. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn describes the session as an efficient one in which the bandmates indulged in an instrumental jam after take 6 and also played a \"delightful\" cover of Buddy Holly's \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", sung by Harrison before beginning take 12.\n\nQuestion: who played guitar on my guitar gently weeps\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, information regarding prescription drug abuse and addiction only seems to surface when someone famous has a problem and needs treatment or dies. Two types of the most commonly abused drugs are opioids and benzodiazepines. Like many other people, Sylvia’s doctor put her on Vicodin because she suffered from chronic migraines. But, like other narcotics, Vicodin lost its effectiveness over time. She could not use her insurance since she was buying several prescriptions of Vicodin at one time. She stole a prescription pad from one of her doctors and began to forge her own prescriptions. One day, she made the mistake of writing a date on the forged prescription that happened to be a Sunday. The pharmacist became suspicious and confronted her about it. This may seem like an unbelievable story, detailing extreme measures to obtain narcotics. The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information reported in May of 2001 that approximately four million people aged twelve and up misuse prescription drugs. Donna, a 34 year old lawyer suffered from extreme anxiety, coupled with panic attacks. She really wanted the tapering off to work, but she began to feel sick in between doses. She would wait until Beth left for work in the morning and then tear the house apart looking for the pills. When she found them, she “stole” a few and put the vial back where Beth hid it. Donna panicked when she realized she was taking more than twice the amount she was supposed to take. Her life had become completely controlled by Xanax. She would panic when she was beginning to run out. Donna’s world was now focused on conning, getting, and taking the pills. She would count them over and over again when she picked up a new prescription. One night, several months later, Beth found Donna unconscious on the floor by the bed. She was rushed to the emergency room. She was medically detoxed in the hospital and sent to a treatment facility to continue the process and begin to learn to live drug-free. However, no one is prescribed alcohol or cocaine for medical reasons. The downside is becoming physically dependent and risking the possibility of addiction. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the area of pain and chemical dependency has become an increasingly important issue. Dependence occurs when tolerance builds up and the body needs the drug in order to function. Somewhere along the line, however, the drug begins to take over their lives and becomes more important than anything else. It may be difficult to understand how someone could let this happen. How could someone who\n\nIt looks like we have a few more rough days ahead of us. First, the bright side of things. Henry's pain is much better controlled. We've been adjusting his morphine drip a couple of times every day. Now, when he is awake, he says that he's not in any pain, and he seems to be sleeping more comfortably. On the flip side, Henry is running fevers constantly, generally 102-103 degrees. This concerns his doctors who plan to adjust his antibiotic regimen. He's already taking zosyn, amikacin, and fluconazole. Henry is also struggling with multiple rashes. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. It breaks my heart to see him go through this. The night nurse just completed midnight vital signs. She will check his blood again near 3am, looking for the need for additional platelets which were transfused earlier today as well. We changed his bed sheets as he's been sleeping without a diaper because of a chemotherapy induced rash from contact with it. The doctors warned us yesterday that his mucositis is going to continue worsening for a few more days. We may need to increase his pain medicine in order for him to tolerate it. As he calmed down he said, \"I don't feel very good.\" I helped him push his pain pump a time or two. He seems to be resting more comfortably now, quietly breathing. The rest of Henry's evening went without major incident. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. We've acclimated to much of what we have to do in the hospital but the effects of this chemotherapy, while we understand are temporary, are difficult to watch. We're dealing with, in no particular order: a fever, mucositis which causes him to drool instead of swallow, some intermittent nausea, and a whopper of a rash. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. Henry is (understandably) grumpy at times, but during his good periods is his usual sweet, inquisitive self. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. He's really enjoyed this poster, with him driving, and Grandma as sidekick. We're hoping Henry will have a better day tomorrow. It will still be several days before his white blood cells are at the detectable range. In the meantime, there's lots of things in his room to make him smile. Henry spent all day in bed and save for his Granya and another family friend coming by, we watched TV. Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. It seems uncomfortable and this seems to be causing his pain. In the middle of the night last night he began running a fever. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! Bryan was on duty last night, and overheard Henry flirting with his nurse when she got him to eat part of a poptart. Henry and Bryan met us at the front door of the hospital on Henry's motorcycle (a really cool trike). The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by a van driven by Stephanie, Lopes' personal assistant. \"It is just such a tragic loss of young lives. Young kids out on a Saturday night to enjoy themselves and something like this happens. I can't do more than express my profound sympathy and condolences to those who have lost their children and their friends in this terrible accident.\" \"Creating more tensions is not going \n\nIn the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service. From a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job. The vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable. The traffic accident was our first call. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing. Sarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. After she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. He seemed in good spirits, all things considered, and even cracked jokes about getting a day off work. We took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department. Sarah gave a handover to the nurse in charge and completed the patient report form that is required after each incident. From delivering babies to attending scenes where someone has died, she responds to a wide range of incidents, some of which require a great deal of emotional resilience. Talking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope. But she said incidents can affect people in different ways, and it is important to have your own coping mechanisms. Our next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. The man, who was alcohol-dependent and had cirrhosis of the liver, was known to the service. We covered his body with a duvet but his dog, who would not leave him, kept pulling it aside. Sarah then explained how paramedics make a diagnosis of death. After completing the diagnosis of death form she contacted emergency services control to check when the police would arrive. All this happened before lunchtime, showing just how intense and varied the life of a paramedic can be. In the afternoon we were called to a GP surgery to take a patient with suspected atrial fibrillation to hospital, attended a minor kitchen fire in a block of flats and saw a patient with multiple sclerosis who said she was in pain. Her physical observations were all within normal range, but she talked about some recent stressful events that were affecting her. Sarah thought the patient’s presentation and body language did not indicate she was in great pain, so she suggested the patient talk to the mental health liaison team in the emergency department, and she agreed to come with us to the hospital. Reflecting on this, Sarah said it was possible the patient was withdrawing from opiates and was engaging in ‘seeking behaviours’ – trying to get morphine from the ambulance or hospital staff – which Sarah had seen before. Paramedics are on the front line of emergency care.\n\nQuestion: when does nathan get in a car accident\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As a part of the collaboration, the company released FaZe-themed flavors, such as \"FaZe Clan's Battle Juice\" in 2019. The resulting team, Atlanta FaZe, was announced on October 26, 2019. On November 22, 2018, FaZe Clan collaborated with sportswear manufacturer Champion to release exclusive clothing. FaZe Sniping made its debut on YouTube on May 30, 2010. Their YouTube content took off when Ted \"Fakie\" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel, ILLCAMS. FaZe Clan's focus on trickshotting and a personality/social-media approach led to FaZe Clan becoming one of the first popular YouTube video game channels, \n\n to other Call of Duty channels which were focused on winning tournaments. In 2012, the channel had one million subscribers, and the clan began to branch out into esports competitions. Teams under the FaZe name began competing in competitions such as the Call of Duty Championship and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships, who were separate from the clan's YouTube content creators, splitting members of FaZe Clan into two mostly autonomous camps.

Surfactants are used in firefighting and pipelines (liquid drag reducing agents). toxicity, although it is more toxic than Halon 1301, and thus considered unsuitable for flooding systems. Halons are very effective on Class A (organic solids), B (flammable liquids and gases), and C (electrical) fires, but they are unsuitable for Class D (metal) fires, as they will not only produce toxic gas and fail to halt the fire, \n\n injected into the fuel tanks for one-time use. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative. Halon 1211 is typically used in hand-held extinguishers, in which a stream of liquid halon is directed at a smaller fire by a user. The stream evaporates under reduced pressure, producing strong local cooling, as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire. After fire suppression, the halon diffuses, leaving no residue. It is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment, or where water-based fire protection is impractical, such as museums, banks, clean rooms and hospitals. This makes it a highly effective fire fighting agent that is safe for people and causes no damage to equipment. HFC-125 is considered a Clean Agent and is therefore included in the National Fire Protection Association's 2001 - Standard for Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems.\n\nQuestion: the removal of temperature in fire fighting method is known as\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was released for the PlayStation 4 on February 20, 2015. Set in an 1886 alternate history steampunk London, the game follows the legendary Knights of the Round Table as they battle to keep the world safe from half-breeds, such as werewolves and vampires, as well as fringe organizations rebelling against the government. The player progresses through the story by journeying through linear paths, defeating enemies and traversing obstacles. The Order: 1886 received mixed reviews from critics. The PlayStation version features the ability to \"empower\" weapons and armor by purchasing elemental-, essence- and aether- based talismans and runes, attuning each to different properties - respectively Fire, Earth, Water, Air; Spirit, Mind, Body; and Light and Dark. Every individual character in the game is based upon one of these nine properties, and use of separate runes and talismans allows the player to defeat certain foes more easily.\n\nQuestion: the witch and the hundred knight 2 us release\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Twitty's version reached number two on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in November 1990 and number one on the Cashbox country charts, making it the last song of Twitty's to hit number one on a national chart. Released as the album's second single, Rogers' version peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Julio Iglesias covered this song in 1998 on his album My Life: The Greatest Hits. The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor.

When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. People with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage. Due to diffusion of exogenous ions (e.g., iron and copper), stains develop into the increasingly and abnormally porous enamel. An individual's fluorosis score is based on the most severe form of fluorosis found on two or more teeth. It scores the spectrum of fluorotic changes in enamel from 0 to 9, allowing more precise definition of mild and severe cases. Causes Dental fluorosis is caused by a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion whilst teeth are forming. The most superficial concern in dental fluorosis is aesthetic changes in the permanent dentition (the adult teeth). The period when these teeth are at highest risk of developing fluorosis is between when the child is born up to 6 years old, though there has been some research which proposes that the most crucial course is during the first 2 years of the child's life. From roughly 7 years old thereafter, most children's permanent teeth would have undergone complete development (except their wisdom teeth), and therefore their susceptibility to fluorosis is greatly reduced, or even insignificant, despite the amount of intake of fluoride. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the amount of fluoride exposure, the age of the child, individual response, weight, degree of physical activity, nutrition, and bone growth. Individual susceptibility to fluorosis is also influenced by genetic factors. Many well-known sources of fluoride may contribute to overexposure including dentifrice/fluoridated mouthrinse (which young children may swallow), excessive ingestion of fluoride toothpaste, bottled waters which are not tested for their fluoride content, inappropriate use of fluoride supplements, ingestion of foods especially imported from other countries, and public water fluoridation. The last of these sources is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of all fluorosis, but the resulting effect due to water fluoridation is largely and typically aesthetic. Dental fluorosis has been growing in the United States concurrent with fluoridation of municipal water supplies, although disproportionately by race. A 2010 CDC report acknowledges an overall incidence of dental fluorosis of 22% from 1986-87 increased to 41% in the early 21st century, with an increase in moderate to severe dental fluorosis from 1% to 4%.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control found a 9 percentage point increase in the prevalence of confirmed dental fluorosis in a 1999-2002 study of\n\nThe prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily attributed to the intake of excessive amounts of fluoride during the tooth development period, typically from birth to around 6-8 years of age. This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary from very mild, characterized by small white areas in the enamel, to severe cases where teeth appear stained and pitted. While drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These additional sources include toothpastes, mouth rinses, fluoride supplements, fluoridated salt or milk, as well as locally applied dental gels, solutions, and varnishes. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis. It is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. Apart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure. In summary, while drinking water can contribute to fluoride exposure, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily due to excessive fluoride intake during tooth development from various sources. Monitoring fluoride intake during this period is crucial to prevent dental fluorosis. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the dose, duration, and age of the individual during the exposure. Dental fluorosis is characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. In \"very mild\" fluorosis, less than 25% of the tooth surface is affected, with small, opaque, scattered white areas. Moderate fluorosis affects all tooth surfaces with mottled appearance, and brown stains may be present. The severity of fluorosis can vary among individuals based on the duration, timing, and dosage of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that people with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria). While there may be cosmetic concerns with fluorosis, its impact on dental decay prevention is a potential benefit.

Ganglion cells then transmit this visual information to the brain via their axons. The axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain. In terms of connectivity in the brain, the axons of ganglion cells primarily connect to a specific region called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From there, visual information is further processed and sent to other areas of the brain responsible for interpreting and perceiving vision. Overall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation. Reference:\n- A ganglion cell (sometimes called a gangliocyte) is a type of neuron located in the retina of the eye that receives visual information from photoreceptors via various intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells. - These axons form the optic nerve and connect mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the brain. Starting from the posterior (back) of the eye, we have the following layers:\n\n1. Ganglion cell layer: This layer contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. The ganglion cells send their axons towards the posterior of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the visual information to the brain for further processing and interpretation. These structures work together to capture, process, and transmit visual signals to the brain for perception. When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Most axons branch, \n\nThe optic nerve plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. These impulses are then transmitted through the fibers of the optic nerve to various visual centers in the brain. It consists of several layers of interconnected neurons and is supported by pigmented epithelial cells. The neural signals generated by the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. The output of these neurons takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These ganglion cells have axons that bundle together to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the electrical impulses generated by the retinal ganglion cells and transmits them to the brain. It is worth mentioning that the retina, including the optic nerve, is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. During vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon. Therefore, the optic nerve serves as a vital pathway through which visual information is transmitted from the retina to the brain, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the visual world.\n\nQuestion: ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

South Carolina named the peach its official fruit in 1984. The peach became the state fruit of Georgia, nicknamed the \"Peach State\", in 1995. The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the boll weevil attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit. Alabama named it the \"state tree fruit\" in 2006. Delaware's state flower has been the peach blossom since 1995, and peach pie became its official dessert in 2009. Peaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal).

Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. In 2016, lead is believed to have resulted in 540,000 deaths worldwide. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure. Classification Classically, \"lead poisoning\" or \"lead intoxication\" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects. However, professionals often use \"lead poisoning\" and \"lead toxicity\" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of \"lead poisoning\" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead. The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity. Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common. Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization state that a blood lead level of 10 μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10 μg/dL. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly. Signs and symptoms Lead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur. Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg/dL.

Children with chronic poisoning\n\n The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. Molds, mildews, bacteria, and dust mites like the same conditions that we do. Bacteria, molds, and mildews are commonly identified within air conditioning units/equipment, humidifier reservoirs, dehumidifier drip pans, showerheads, toilets, and ice machines. Note: When molds, mildew, dust mites, and bacteria are disrupted or release their spores into the air, this results in Bioaerosols formation. The use of a chemical or mechanical dehumidifier. Remove debris from your yard, roof and gutters. Clean mold and mildew growth from walls with water mixed with chlorine bleach, diluted three parts water to one part bleach. Commercial products can also remove mold and mildew. Check heating and cooling system filters monthly or as needed based on visible appearance. Check air conditioners for mold before each cooling season and have coils cleaned as needed. Air cleaners and filters are other options. Electronic and HEPA (high efficiency particulate absolute) cleaners and filters are the best at taking mold, mildew, and dust out of the air. In summary, Bioaerosols, such as molds, mildew, and dust mites, are commonly found in indoor air. It is poisonous in nearly all of its compounds, but despite its usefulness in many applications today which give little cause for concern, the presence of lead in paints (because it is resistant to corrosion) in addition to its being as antiknock additive to gasoline that have given rise to health and safety concerns. Lead poisoning can result in brain damage or death, and while for adults it generally requires substantial cumulative exposures for harmful effects, in children brain damage occurs from much more limited exposure. It is this fact that has caused regulations to focus on those lead applications, principally lead paint, which represent the greatest risk to be encountered by children, namely residential uses where lead contaminated paint can be ingested. A blood test is the general method for determining lead poisoning and the current definition, according to the Center for Disease Control, is 10ug/do of blood. In sharp contrast to asbestos where the latency for asbestos-caused diseases is 15 to 30 years, lead has no latency. Despite the fact that lead health risks as far back as Roman times, it was the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the late 1970’s that focused regulations on lead use and handling. Currently, laws and regulation governing the use, treatment and handling of lead have been promulgated on a federal level by EPA, OSHA, Consumer Product Safety commission, CDC, DOT and HUD. In Maine, regulations have come from the Bureau of Health and will soon come from the DEP. Some municipalities have also issued regulations, and Portland has done so through its Health Department and its Code Enforcement Department. The methods for lead abatement are the same as for asbestos encapsulation, enclosure, and removal; however, more than for asbestos economics tends to drive the method of abatement and removal is not always a priority. The same clean room technology utilized in asbestos work is also employed in lead abatement; although, when the removal process involves a wetting agent, as in chemical removal or water blasting, such elaborate containment is not required as the liquid prevents the contaminants from becoming airborne. Depending on lead levels, the material may be classified as hazardous waste or solid waste (non hazardous). Concentrated paint scrapings might likely be classified as the former while wood trim pained with lead paint might be classified as the latter. The largest and most significant difference between asbestos and lead abatement work is in the nature and immediacy of the risk. Asbestos abatement often involves commercial or industrial settings where it poses an occupational risk, but not a general health risk. To the extent that abatement involves a residential setting, the work, because of the nature of the building products involved, is usually confined to the utility areas of the dwelling, most often the cellar, or to the exterior and not to living space. Lead on the other hand, while historically used extensively in paints for all applications, possesses the greatest risk in those areas where the paint can be ingested by children. Even within these areas, concern is generally limited to surfaces where the paint is deteriorated and peeling so that flakes could be ingested or on places where a child might actually chew the paint (mountable surfaces). As a result, abatement most often occurs in those areas where exposure for those most susceptible to lead poisoning is greatest. That is to say that elevated lead levels in blood occur shortly after ingestion (or inhalation in the case of airborne dust). These factors pose much higher levels of potential\n\nLead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body.

The Finnish Lapphund is an alert, friendly, and intelligent breed. Although they were bred to herd reindeer and are known for their courage, they are generally very calm and submissive with humans. The Finnish Lapphund gets along well with most people and animals. He will get along well with other dogs, as well as cats and smaller pets, if he is raised with them. The Finnish Lapphund is energetic and needs both physical and mental stimulation. A couple of long walks or high energy sessions daily are ideal for a Finnish Lapphund. With his strength and excellent stamina, the Finnish Lapphund is the perfect companion for a hike or run. If you do live in a warmer climate, be sure to monitor your Finnish Lapphund for overheating. The Finnish Lapphund does tend to bark a lot and has a strong startle reflex. Training can help reduce this problem, but the Finnish Lapphund is not a particularly quiet dog by nature. The intelligent Finnish Lapphund can learn new things quickly and enjoys being challenged. When training your Finnish Lapphund, use positive reinforcement such as delicious treats, extra play time, or praise to keep him motivated. Finnish Lapphunds do excel in dog sports and competitions, so a little patience and positive reinforcement will go a long way. The Finnish Lapphund has a thick coat that will require weekly brushing to keep it clean, well-groomed, and free of dead or loose hair. A Finnish Lapphund’s shedding will not get out of control if you brush him regularly. Frequent bathing is not needed for a Finnish Lapphund, so bathe him as needed, perhaps once every three months unless he gets dirty. A premium brand dry kibble is typically a good choice for a Finnish Lapphund. Like most Northern breeds, they do have a slower metabolism, so avoid overfeeding. Excessive or rapid weight gain can lead to joint problems for this breed. The cost for a Finnish Lapphund varies widely, with some puppies going for as little as $600 and others costing up to $2300. Prices vary according to breeder location, gender, pedigree, and if the puppy has potential to be a competitive show dog or is expected to be a house pet. Finnish Lapphunds can be adopted as well, with adoption fees typically costing around $175. The Finnish Lapphund ranks a 3. He can get along well with children, cats, and other dogs. However, he may bark frequently, and he requires physical and mental stimulation, as well as a trainer who can handle his independent thinking patiently. According to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons although rare, one health issue which affects Ridgebacks more than other dogs is ‘dermoid sinus’. Many breeders offer a guarantee against dermoid sinus and most will automatically refund the cost of the puppy should this genetic fault occur. Another health concern common to most large breeds is hip dysplasia. It is not yet routine to screen all puppies for these genetic problems but is adopted by breeders wishing to avoid the risk of these conditions in subsequent generations. Many thanks to Karin Wolgast Fürst of Kadamo Kennel for stunning photos of Yaya, Mira, Bellman, Äijä and Maximus. In the past, many breeders would routinely cull any puppies without a ridge but it is now common practice for these pups to be sold as pets only. Although these dogs cannot be shown in the ring, they are completely unaffected by the lack of this purely cosmetic trait and are Ridgebacks in every other sense. They still make wonderful companion pets. This tail wagging is also a danger to any glass of wine within range, so watch out when the excitement hits! Ridgebacks have expressive eyes that reflect the spirit of this large, intelligent dog who loves to run and play. He’s not a barker, but a Ridgeback will always protect his family. This is not to be confused with aggression; a Ridgeback of proper temperament will be more inclined to ignore, rather than challenge, a stranger. Ridgebacks are strong-willed, intelligent, and many seem to have a penchant for mischief, though as family pets they are very loving and loyal. Despite their athletic, sometimes imposing, exterior, the Ridgeback has a sensitive side, is very intuitive and does not respond well to inconsistent, panicky or uncertain approaches to discipline. No dog likes to be left alone for long periods and ridgebacks are no exception. Ridgebacks can be both family dogs or loyal one-person companions. If raised around children from puppyhood they will be loving family pets. Ridgebacks are protective of their owners and families. If trained well, they can be excellent guard dogs. Despite being a large dog, Ridgebacks are usually happy to curl up on their bed in a corner and are happy living in a small space. Most Ridgebacks are sleek and clean looking animals, however, if they are indoor pets they will shed their short hair throughout the year. On the whole, Ridgebacks don’t have a strong ‘doggy’ smell and as a general rule require minimal bathing. When it comes to strangers, the Ridegbacks temperament is best described as 'aloof' and purebred Ridgebacks do not feature strongly in\n\n The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog. A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier. It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the \"Wheaten greetin\". Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but are lively and can be more active than many other breeds. They are cool-weather dogs and can become easily overheated in \n\n Puppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur. The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from 17 to 20 in in \n\nWeight – Females: 7-9 lbs. Papillon pups are pint-sized, cheerful little purebreds that have overall good health. But there are a few serious health conditions that plague the breed. However, not all Papillon pups will develop a health issue in their lifetime. The same goes for many other health conditions that are prominent in the Papillon breed. There are also the usual illnesses that can affect any dog of any breed, such as heart disease and some kinds of cancer. Naturally gentle, lively, and friendly, the Papillon would make one of the best family pets, especially for families with children and other dogs. These pups are non-confrontational and affectionate, even towards most strangers. However, it would be best to rely on other pups to be watchdogs, as these purebreds would rather be sleeping with you at nighttime. While it would be a good idea to take these pups for a couple of short walks at least twice a day, the Papillon is a dog that would be just as happy snuggling on the couch for the afternoon. Their exercise needs are minimum, but they would love a quick romp and play in the backyard with your youngsters and other pups. Papillons are clever, agile, and alert with an innate eagerness to please their loved ones. Training sessions are easier with these pups than most other dogs because these purebreds pay close attention and grasp instructions quickly. The only training challenge you may face is housebreaking your Papillon. These purebreds love tricks and learning new ways to show their playful side to their loved ones, but house-training isn’t any fun to them. Make it fun for your Papillon with lots of praise, encouragement, and meaty, bite-sized rewards. Due to their small stature, the Papillon needs a nutrient-rich diet to keep their little body energized and healthy. The Papillon loves treats, like any pup, but make sure they are bite-sized indulgences. Papillons are popular breeds because of their sweet nature and loving manner. Therefore, there is no shortage of Papillon breeders. However, make sure you ask to see health histories of both parents, as well as AKC documentation of the pup, before you invest in a breeder. Many breeders are trustworthy and reliable, but you have to weed out the ones who are only in the business for the money, not the health and care of the purebred. Before you invest in a breeder, take a look through your local animal shelter. As far as family pets go, the Papillon is one of the best. These purebreds have a natural eagerness to please their loved ones, which makes training easier. Their grooming regime is easy too, making the upkeep of the Papillon simple and doable for anyone.\n\nQuestion: what breed of dog is the teddy bear dog\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of Provincial Congresses. The Battle of Bunker Hill followed on June 17, 1775. The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington. Eight militiamen were killed, including Ensign Robert Munroe, their third in command. About 700 British Army regulars in Boston, under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith, were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord. Eight Lexington men were killed, and ten were wounded.

In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle, which then pumps it into the main artery of the body, the aorta. From the aorta, the blood is distributed through a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the veins, entering the right atrium to complete the cycle. One key distinction between pulmonary and systemic circulation is the blood pressure within the two systems. The pressure in the pulmonary circulation is significantly lower compared to the systemic circulation. This constriction helps redirect blood flow from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions, optimizing gas exchange. The two circulatory systems differ in their purpose, blood pressure, and unique regulatory mechanisms. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins.The left side of the heart pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation.The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries.It is surrounded by a tough fibrous sac, the pericardium, which also contains the beginnings and ends of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood through pulmonary circulation. The left side of the heart pumps blood through systemic circulation. This diagram shows the right and left side of the heart artificially separated. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the low-pressure pulmonary circulation. During pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae and enters the right atrium. From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. Systemic circulation begins when oxygenated blood enters the left atrium from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. As the oxygen is used up and waste products are produced, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process of circulation begins again. It begins when deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, specifically the right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery. In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. One key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system.\n\nQuestion: how oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under the option’s first alternative, Veterans now receiving compensation for those conditions would have their compensation reduced or eliminated, and Veterans who applied for compensation for those conditions in the future would not be eligible for it. The second alternative would affect only new applicants for disability compensation. Most of the savings would result from curtailing payments to current recipients of disability compensation. The option would result in about 1,200 fewer of those cases in 2028, CBO estimates. Savings from the second alternative, in which only new applicants for disability compensation would be ineligible to receive payments for the seven conditions, would be about $4 billion over the 2020–2028 period, CBO estimates. CBO projects the number of Veterans receiving payments for those conditions on the basis of historical information on the number of Veterans receiving a disability rating for such conditions, the growth of the overall disability compensation program, the mortality rate of the disability compensation population, and other factors. An argument against this option is that Veterans’ compensation could be viewed as a lifetime indemnification the federal government owes to people who become disabled to any degree during service in the armed forces. In 2017, 4.5 million Veterans with medical conditions‌or injuries that were incurred or that worsened during active-duty service received disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Of those Veterans, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, about 180,000 were age 67 or older. Of those Veterans, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, about 180,000 were age 67 or older. Under the first alternative, VA would stop making IU payments to Veterans age 67 or older (the full retirement age for Social Security benefits for those born after 1959). That restriction would apply to both current and prospective recipients. Therefore, at age 67, VA disability payments would revert to the amount‌ associated with the rated disability level. Unlike under the first alternative, Veterans who are already receiving IU payments and are age 67 or older after the effective date of the option would continue to collect the IU supplement. By CBO’s estimates, the savings from the first alternative, in which Veterans age 67 or older may no longer collect the IU supplement, would be $48 billion between 2020 and 2028. That reduction in spending is the result of a decrease in the number of Veterans who would qualify for the supplement. CBO estimates that the number of Veterans who would no longer receive or qualify for the IU supplement would total nearly 235,000 in 2020. That number would increase to 382,000 Veterans in 2028, with savings totaling $7 billion in that year. The savings from the second alternative, which would end IU payments to new recipients and bar applications from Veterans who are age 67 or older after the effective date of the option, would total $7 billion between 2020 and 2028. CBO projects the number of Veterans receiving the IU supplement on the basis of past growth in the number of new recipients (by age) and adjusts that number to account for the morbidity of beneficiaries and other factors, such as the backlog of disability cases to be decided. For IU recipients who would no longer receive the supplement under this option, CBO determines per-Veteran savings by reducing the payment amount to a level that corresponds to the Veteran’s overall disability rating. CBO estimates that rating on the basis of historical data on IU recipients and anticipated changes in the distribution of their ratings. The largest sources of uncertainty in the estimate of savings over the next 10 years are CBO’s estimates of the number of participants who would be affected by the option and of the disability ratings of those affected. Changes\n\nBut no single one of these measures can bear the full load of adaptation to population aging, since the changes would have to be so severe and disruptive as to be politically impossible.Pressures to increase retirement ages in industrialized countries and to reduce benefits are increasing.In other words, while in crude terms there are today 4 workers supporting the pensions and other costs of each older person, by 2050 there will only be 2. There are only so many ways to meet the challenge of an extended period of dependency, including increasing the productivity of those in the labor force, saving more, reducing consumption, increasing the number of years worked by increasing the age of retirement, increasing the voluntary nonmonetary productive contributions of the retired, and immigration of very large numbers of young workers into the “old” countries. Pressures to increase retirement ages in industrialized countries and to reduce benefits are increasing. But no single one of these measures can bear the full load of adaptation to population aging, since the changes would have to be so severe and disruptive as to be politically impossible.Population health and the ability to function at work and in everyday life interact with these population ratios in significant ways.The physical and cognitive capacity to continue to work at older ages is crucial if the age of retirement is raised.Similarly, caregiving often requires significant physical and emotional stamina. Most Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. During most of the postwar period, that age was 55. Because government social security payments normally begin at age 60, workers are forced to find reemployment to fill the five-year gap. However, in 1986 the Japanese Diet passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly \n\nJust two decades ago, the prevalent view of aging was highly pessimistic.Further, healthier older populations require less caregiving and medical services.Similarly, caregiving often requires significant physical and emotional stamina.The physical and cognitive capacity to continue to work at older ages is crucial if the age of retirement is raised.The dramatically declining number of workers per older person (however determined) is at the crux of the economic challenge of population aging.

This can be achieved through investments in education, training, and technology, which can enhance the skills and efficiency of workers. Another strategy is to encourage individuals to save more for their retirement. This can help alleviate the strain on public pension systems and ensure individuals have sufficient funds to support themselves in old age. Increasing the number of years worked by raising the age of retirement is a commonly considered strategy. As people are living longer and healthier lives, extending the working years can contribute to increased productivity and economic output. However, this must be implemented carefully, considering factors such as the physical and cognitive capacity of individuals to continue working and ensuring opportunities for older workers in the job market. Another potential strategy involves leveraging the voluntary nonmonetary contributions of the retired. In practice, a combination of these strategies is often necessary to effectively address the economic challenges posed by an aging population. By considering factors such as productivity, savings, consumption, retirement age, voluntary contributions, and immigration, countries can develop comprehensive approaches that promote economic sustainability while supporting the well-being of older individuals.\n\nQuestion: when did the government change the retirement age\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sugar, soda and sweets played a significant role in Jill’s diet along with cereal grains, rice and potatoes. Jill craved sweets, snacked constantly and ate often. Constipation, gas and bloat were common for Jill. Instead, Jill was told to use an inhaler and was given steroids. When Jill’s menstrual cycle began, she suffered amenorrhea [irregular periods] sometimes skipping several months. Jill saw improvement, but after a few months, the problem returned followed by a persistent bronchial cough low energy and weight gain. Soon thereafter, Jill’s menstrual cycle included problematic, tender, lumpy breasts [fibroid tumors] and occasionally, cysts on her ovaries. Instead, she found comfort among those with similar problems. Jill’s behavior became a serious problem made worse by unpredictable anxiety attacks. Her mother took Jill to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her, schizophrenic and bi-polar and put her on psychotropic drugs. Now, Jill suffered the social stigma of being a mental case. At age 18, Jill became sexually active and began using birth control pills. Birth control pills caused Jill’s menstrual and hormonal issues to compound in the form of chronic bladder and vaginal infections [so-called], heavy depression, imaginary voices and intense anxiety. Jill was given more antibiotics and additional drugs for her problems. Jill married at age 20 and became pregnant soon after. Like Jill, the little girl had learning problems at school and suffered from so-called, attention deficit disorder (ADD). Jill’s diet was heavy in carbohydrates and sugar; sodas and fruit juice were staples. Both Jill and her husband drank. Jill favored wine; she had been told [wrongly!] By age 40, Jill was overweight, depressed and on occasion, suicidal. By age 48, Jill’s health was in shambles. Jill had been betrayed! Jill’s story is a classic example of defective medical models that are based on symptoms instead of cause! Had Jill’s UNDERLYING issues been correctly diagnosed, her life could have been VERY different. Jill suffered from misdiagnosis and lack of guidance. A recurring theme in Jill’s story is systemic inflammation and antibiotics. Jill’s Betrayal Is Our Betrayal, as well! The medical system betrayed Jill [and the rest of us!] Jill’s struggle with weight and acne, depression, acid reflux, brain fog [poor memory], mental confusion, allergies, hair loss, chemical sensitivities and low energy were driven by systemic take-over by molds and fungi; particularly, Candida albicans. Her betrayal is an example of sick-care at its best. Regardless, when they announce, the ability to identify and understand the contributing factors is invaluable. I trust the reader will exercise this freedom, as opposed to getting in line for more of the same, otherwise known as, sick-care. Would probiotics have solved Jill’s intestinal issues? Her gas and bloat issues, allergies, chemical sensitivities and leaky-gut problems have their origin in hyphae invasion of the mucous membrane lining of Jill’s intestinal, gut wall. Jill, 16, learned from genetic testing at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) that she had Kallmann syndrome. When Jill was 4, her pediatrician discovered she didn’t have a sense of smell. Dr. Vogiatzi ordered several tests, including an MRI of Jill’s brain to check if her pituitary or hypothalamus looked abnormal, but unfortunately nothing was conclusive. When it hadn’t, Dr. Vogiatzi referred Jill to Louisa Pyle, MD, PhD, and Emma Bedoukian, MS, of the Differences of Sexual Development and Endogenetics Clinic, within the Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center (RIMGC). The genetic testing results confirmed their and Dr. Vogiatzi’s suspicions, based on Jill’s missing sense of smell; she had Kallmann syndrome. Jill didn’t have those symptoms. People with FGFR1 mutations may have any range of puberty from normal to start-and-stall puberty (as was the case with Jill) to no hint of sexual development, which is called complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. The genetic testing allowed Dr. Vogiatzi to tailor Jill’s treatment. Jill began hormone-replacement therapy, and it has worked. Vogiatzi says the chances are strong that Jill will be able to have children in the future, with the help of medication. The treatment certainly isn’t slowing Jill down, either. As a high school junior, she has continued her sports and music activities plus volunteered at Princeton Special Sports, serve as a peer leader at her school, worked in an ice cream shop and organized an annual Alex’s Lemonade Stand to raise money for pediatric cancer research.

Firstly, once the jill has recovered from anesthesia, it is important to force-feed concentrated nutritional supplements hourly. If the jill has experienced toxemia due to a change in diet, it is recommended to offer her original diet mixed with warm water to create a porridge. In the case of a mildly toxemic jill within 24 hours of her due date, prostaglandin and oxytocin can be used to induce parturition. However, if the kits are left with the jill after she has fully recovered from anesthesia, a supplement of puppy or kitten milk replacer can be administered six times daily using a fine-tipped pipette. This will sustain them for 24 hours until it becomes clear whether the jill is lactating. Remember, these steps are based on general guidelines for providing proper nutrition and hydration to a recovering jill. The article deals with the series' main, recurring, and minor characters. Main Overview Notes Dr. Will Halstead Portrayed by Nick Gehlfuss Dr. Will Halstead is an attending in the Emergency Department. He was first introduced to the Chicago franchise in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Say Her Real Name\" as Detective Jay Halstead's estranged brother who drops by to visit in a two-episode arc. The character moved to Med after being introduced in the show's backdoor pilot on Chicago Fire and Gehlfuss was made a regular cast member when the characters at Chicago Medical Center who appeared in both Fire and P.D. After the backdoor pilot of Chicago Med, he decided to switch specialties to emergency medicine. When Med first premiered, he was Chief Resident. Charge Nurse Maggie Lockwood, who sometimes uses the nickname \"Big Red\" when referring to Dr. Halstead, once described him as \"a slightly anal, overly stubborn, rule breaking, control freak\". Dr. Halstead's relationship with hospital administrator Sharon Goodwin has been historically fraught, and Halstead's job has been jeopardized on multiple occasions. In season 1 Dr. Halstead clashes a number of times with Dr. Connor Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and Sharon Goodwin, the chief administrator, over hospital practices and policies. He particularly disliked Dr. Rhodes as he felt the latter was an entitled \"rich kid\" from the more affluent northern suburbs. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another. He also earns the ire of attending Dr. Kendra Perrington in the episode \"Inheritance\" for overriding her at the request of the patient's brother, who was his former schoolmate, only to find out that she was on the hiring committee. For much of early season 2, he stresses out over his finances as he still had to pay off his student loans and sizeable malpractice insurance (due to his malpractice suit from the episode \"Clarity\"). He initially sees final year medical student Jeff Clarke as a rival for Natalie's affections but develops a friendship with Clarke and often encourages him. During the first season, Dr. Halstead had feelings for the pediatric emergency medicine fellow, Dr. Natalie Manning, who was then pregnant with her late husband's baby. It caused some awkwardness as her mother-in-law (portrayed by actress Annie Potts) was extremely protective and initially viewed him with suspicion. He eventually decided to move on and starts dating pathologist Nina Shore (portrayed by Patti Murin, the real-life wife of Gehlfuss' co-star Colin Donnell). They move in together in the season 2 episode \"Free Will\". They break up in finale of season 2 because he still has feelings for Dr. Manning. In the first episode of season 3 “Nothing To Fear”, she returns from a three-month sabbatical and tells him she also has feelings for him too and they became a couple. In season 4 they prepare for their wedding but Dr. Halstead finds himself in a difficult position when a neighborhood friend he made a house call to turns out to be federally listed criminal wanted by both the CPD and FBI. When he was first introduced on P.D., it was implied that he and Jay had not seen each other for some time. The brothers had a difficult relationship with their late father Pat as he disapproved of both his sons' occupations. It was a reference to actor Nick Gehlfuss's days as a busker in New York City when he first entered the acting industry. Dr. Natalie Manning Portrayed by Torrey DeVitto Dr. Natalie Manning (née Conte) is a pediatrician originally from Seattle who is an attending in emergency medicine specializing in pediatrics. Natalie was widowed when her husband, Jeff, a soldier, was killed in Afghanistan and gave birth to their son, Owen. She is revealed to be a skilled violinist, as seen in season 1 episode \"Fallback\" and season 2 episode \"Brother's Keeper\". In season 1, Natalie is portrayed as a caring doctor who sometimes becomes overly emotionally connected to her young patients. In Season 1, Episode 10, \"Clarity\", Dr Will Halstead kisses her, showing her that he has feelings for her. However, as she is grieving her late husband, she gently tells Dr Halstead that she does have feelings for him, it just \"isn't the right time yet\". At the start of Season 2, she begins a relationship with Jeff Clarke. However, she breaks up with him after he \"humiliates\" her during a M&M review. After the breakup, she begins to have feelings for Will, but he is in a relationship with Nina Shore. In the first episode of the third season “Nothing To Fear”, Natalie returns from a three-month sabbatical and tells Will she has feelings for him and they became a couple. They go on a break near the end of Season 3, where he drunkenly kisses one of Natalie's old co-workers. It also shows the couple attending Pre-Cana together. At the end of Season 4, Agent Lee convinces Natalie to take Will back, so she goes after him and gets into his car as she was going to tell him that she still loves him, until a car hits them. While unconscious, her ex-boyfriend, Phillip Davis slipped a ring onto her finger and convinced everyone that they were engaged, except for Dr Marcel who brings it up with Phillip and tells Will. She eventually finds out and calls it off, before trying to get back with Will, who has moved on to Dr Asher. It is unknown if she still likes Will or if he has any feelings left for her, but it is assumed that she has feelings for Dr Marcel after they were in a hostage situation in the Season 5 finale. In Season 6, Natalie alters data on a trial Will is running to have her mother accepted. The opening of Season 7 revealed Natalie had been fired and\n\nQuestion: who plays jill bigelow in line of duty\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles). From there, it ranges along the Andean foothills to northwestern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and finally the Rio de la Plata. The inland range continues in northwestern Uruguay and extends northwest through northern Argentina, Paraguay–Bolivia, and through the Pantanal at the southern Cerrado; the range extends in two arms, to the northwest to northern Bolivia, and northeastwards to headwaters of the Amazon Basin Tapajós River. It is bounded on the west by the Dry Chaco, a semi-arid region of dry forests and savannas. It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers.

Its most notable feature is the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World), a large statue by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi that was dedicated in 1886. The island also contains the Statue of Liberty Museum, which opened in 2019 and exhibits the statue's original torch. In 1966, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island. An original feature is the bronze pedestal, which represents the famous Liberty Bell, the height being 9 feet with a diameter of nearly 10 feet. The statue symbolizing Liberty shows the Goddess of Liberty starting forward bursting the chains from her arms.

The Mississippi River System, also referred to as the Western Rivers, is a mostly riverine network of the United States which includes the Mississippi River and connecting waterways. The Mississippi River is the largest drainage basin in the United States. From the perspective of natural geography and hydrology, the system consists of the Mississippi River itself and its numerous natural tributaries and distributaries. The major tributaries are the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Red rivers. Given their flow volumes, major Ohio River tributaries like the Allegheny, Tennessee, and Wabash rivers are considered important tributaries to the Mississippi \n\n  The Lower Mississippi River is the portion of the Mississippi River downstream of Cairo, Illinois.

The next morning, Odysseus washes ashore and is found by some Phaeacians girls. With help from Phaeacian King Alcinous (Jeroen Krabbé), they help Odysseus back to Ithaca. They deliver him at night while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. Upon awakening the next morning, he finds himself on Ithaca where is reunited with Telemachus. In Book 9 of the Odyssey, Odysseus describes to his hosts the Phaeacians his encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus. Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says \"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes\". Homer had already (Book 6) described the Cyclopes as \"men overweening in pride who plundered [their neighbors the Phaeacians] continually\", driving the Phaeacians from their home. In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as: \"an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich \n\n A minority view is that the landfalls of Odysseus were inspired by places on a much shorter itinerary along the coast of Greece itself. One of the earliest to suggest any locations here was the 2nd century AD geographer Pausanias who, in his Description of Greece, suggested that the nekyia took place at the river Acheron in north west Greece, where the Necromanteion was subsequently built. However the location was overlooked or dismissed by many subsequently, until the archaeologist Sotirios Dakaris excavated the site, beginning in 1958. Ancient sources provide a wealth of interpretations of Odysseus' wanderings, with a complex range of traditions which affect one another in various ways.\n\nQuestion: where do the phaeacians live in the odyssey\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia. This condition is similar to hypermetropia or far-sightedness which starts in childhood and exhibits similar symptoms of blur in the vision for close objects. It is a type of refractive error along with nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The most common treatment is glass correction using appropriate convex lens. Many extreme presbyopes complain that their arms have become \"too short\" to hold reading material at a comfortable distance. Presbyopia, like other focal imperfections, becomes less noticeable in bright sunlight when the pupil becomes smaller. As with any lens, increasing the focal ratio of the lens increases depth of field by reducing the level of blur of out-of-focus objects (compare the effect of aperture on depth of field in photography). Interaction with myopia\nPeople with low near-sightedness can read comfortably without eyeglasses or contact lenses even after age forty, but higher myopes might require two pairs of glasses (one for distance, one for near), bifocal, or progressive lenses. However, their myopia does not disappear and the long-distance visual challenges remain. Myopes considering refractive surgery are advised that surgically correcting their nearsightedness may be a disadvantage after age forty, when the eyes become presbyopic and lose their ability to accommodate or change focus, because they will then need to use glasses for reading. A surgical technique offered is to create a \"reading eye\" and a \"distance vision eye\", a technique commonly used in contact lens practice, known as monovision. Monovision can be created with contact lenses, so candidates for this procedure can determine if they are prepared to have their corneas reshaped by surgery to cause this effect permanently. Mechanism\n\nThe cause of presbyopia is lens hardening by decreasing levels of -crystallin, a process which may be sped up by higher temperatures. There is some confusion over how the focusing mechanism of the eye works. In the 1977 book, Eye and Brain, for example, the lens is said to be suspended by a membrane, the 'zonula', which holds it under tension. The ability to focus on near objects declines throughout life, from an accommodation of about 20 dioptres (ability to focus at 50 mm away) in a child, to 10 dioptres at age 25 (100 mm), and levels off at 0.5 to 1 dioptre at age 60 (ability to focus down to 1–2 meters only). Treatment\nIn the visual system, images captured by the eye are translated into electric signals that are transmitted to the brain where they are interpreted. As such, in order to overcome presbyopia, two main components of the visual system can be addressed: image capturing by the optical system of the eye and image processing in the brain. People with presbyopia require a convex lens for reading glasses; specialized preparations of convex lenses usually require the services of an optometrist. Some people choose contact lenses to correct one eye for near and one eye for far with a method called monovision.

The retina receives the picture formed by these light rays and sends the image to the brain through the optic nerve. Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when light rays are focused in front of the retina instead of directly on the retina. Myopia is a vision problem experienced by approximately one-third of the population. The more myopic the eye, the closer an object must be before it is in sharp focus. Nearsighted people have difficulty seeing objects at a distance, such as highway signs, but usually can see up-close for tasks such as reading or sewing. Some people with myopia can use their natural nearsightedness to read without glasses at an age when other people must wear reading glasses. Hyperopia or farsightedness occurs when light rays are not bent enough to focus on the retina. Hyperopia is a common vision problem, affecting about one-fourth of the population. If the eye is too short from front to back, light rays reach the retina before they converge (focus). But with aging, the human lens loses this ability and a hyperopic person eventually may have difficulty seeing objects at a distance, as well as those that are nearby. Astigmatism occurs when light rays are focused at more than one point on the retina. Astigmatism is the most common vision problem. Light entering the eye does not focus symmetrically on the retina. The result is astigmatism, which blurs both near and distance vision. This refractive error may occur in patients who are either myopic (nearsighted) or hyperopic (farsighted). Eyeglasses or contact lens prescriptions with three parts indicate some amount of astigmatism. Patients who believe they have astigmatism should discuss this subject in further detail with their physician to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms in their case. Some people with myopia can use their natural nearsightedness to read without glasses at an age when other people must wear reading glasses. In monovision, refractive surgery is used to adjust one eye for “near” vision and the other eye for “distance” vision. Vision problems are challenging. From eye exams to eyeglasses, lab tests to surgical treatments for serious eye diseases, our comprehensive care meets the needs of infants, children and adults.

There are three distinct ways that precipitation can occur. Convective precipitation is generally more intense, and of shorter duration, than stratiform precipitation. Orographic precipitation occurs when moist air is forced upwards over rising terrain, such as a mountain. Precipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing level. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Their respective intensities are classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction. Convective precipitation (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \"roll clouds\" and tornadoes may occur. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted. ; Ice storm – Ice storms are \n\n most commonly a natural phenomenon, created during some of the largest bushfires, forest fires, and wildfires.

For instance, research suggests taller people suffer more from a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, as well as Marfan syndrome (a connective tissue and collagen disorder), which can come with heart valve problems and abnormalities of the aorta. Being short also seems to come with risks. A study from 2015 found that shorter people suffer coronary artery disease more often. “Growth during this period of childhood is not significantly associated with either of these stroke subtypes, suggesting that underlying mechanisms linking height with risks of stroke may exert their influence already by early childhood,” wrote the stroke study authors. The research looked at data on more than 300,000 Danish schoolchildren born over nearly six decades. Researchers noted that boys and girls who were 2 to 3 inches shorter than average when they were between ages 7 and 13 were at increased risk during their adult years of clot-related, or ischemic, stroke in both sexes and of bleeding, or hemorrhagic, stroke in men. Despite studies over many decades looking at height and health, there’s still a lot unknown about how the two intersect. What is considered “short” or “tall” varies by study with consideration to the population and gender being studied. There also is usually a midpoint height used based on the research. In the stroke study, the average height at age 7 was about 4 feet for both boys and girls. Is it height or is it an environmental factor, such as nutrition, that made the difference? In 2010, a meta-analysis of 52 studies involving more than 3 million men and women found that shorter people had a higher risk of having deadly heart disease than tall people. But Dr. Jaakko Tuomilehto of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki in Finland and author of the editorial “Tall is beautiful and heart-healthy?” published in 2010 in European Heart Journal didn’t stop there, suggesting everyone model healthy behaviors. “On the other hand, tall people are not protected against coronary heart disease, and they also need to pay attention to the same risk factors as shorter people,” he wrote. Characteristic features of hypochondroplasia include short stature, short arms and legs, and broad, short hands and feet. People with hypochondroplasia also often have a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen in achondroplasia and may not become noticeable until early or middle childhood. The adult height for men with hypochondroplasia usually ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 5 inches), while the height range for adult women is typically 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet 2 inches to 4 feet 11 inches). Primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, achondroplasia is one of the common causes of dwarfism. Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. In terms of epidemiology, achondroplasia is similar to many other congenital conditions such as achondrogenesis, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda and osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, it also shares similar presentations with other diseases like thanatophoric dysplasia as well as osteoporosis. Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Two other diseases have similar genetic basis, namely thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds. The other visible signs and symptoms of this disease are hypotonia or low muscle tone and slow motor movement. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. It also has genetic similarities to thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. It affects both males and females, with female patients having an average height of 4 feet and ½ inches (123 centimeters) and male patients having an average height of 4 feet and 3½ inches (131 centimeters). A DNA test can help identify homozygosity, and a skeletal survey can be used to diagnose the condition. The signs of achondroplasia include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base, and narrow foramen magnum. All people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood.\n\nQuestion: what is the average height of a chinese man\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A converging optical system or lens has two principal foci that are real. A diverging optical system or lens has a second principal focus that is virtual. In curved mirrors the two principal foci coincide. Depending upon whether the object is at infinity or at the principal focus, this same focal point becomes either the second principal focus or the first principal focus, respectively.

Thicker phosphor layers cause more diffusion and yield a lower resolution. Resolution is also inversely proportional to the diameter of the laser beam. Effective beam diameter is increased by vibration in the rotating mirror and drum scanner designs. Slow scan motion influences resolution by the increment of plate advancement. This increment may be adjusted to increase or reduce resolution in some systems. Software displays of all digital images permit magnification of images. A periapical image filling the display of a computer monitor may be magnified by a factor of 10 times or more. At this level of magnification, the image takes on a building block pattern or pixelated appearance, and the limits of resolution of the imaging system are evident.A desirable quality in intraoral image receptors is the ability to record a broad range of tissue attenuation differences—from gingiva to enamel.At the same time, subtle differences in attenuation within these tissues should be visually apparent.The useful range of densities in film radiography is two orders of magnitude, from 0.5 to 2.5.\n\n length f at the distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor at 2f beyond that lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second image with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula showing that with object distance ). Ideally, this second image is the mirror image of the first image, so you could put an image sensor there and record the mirrored first image. If a longer distance is needed, this can be repeated. In practice, the lens will be an achromatic doublet. In modern optical telescopes and telescopic sights with a dual-focal plane design, the objective image is typically already inverted upon reaching the relay lenses, and thus needed to be inverted again back \n\n An autocollimator is an optical instrument for non-contact measurement of angles. They are typically used to align components and measure deflections in optical or mechanical systems. An autocollimator works by projecting an image onto a target mirror and measuring the deflection of the returned image against a scale, either visually or by means of an electronic detector. A visual autocollimator can measure angles as small as 1 arc-second (4.85 micro-radians), while an electronic autocollimator can have up to 100 times more resolution. Visual autocollimators are often used for aligning laser rod ends and checking the face parallelism of optical windows and wedges. Servo autocollimators are specialized compact forms of electronic autocollimators that are used in high-speed servo-feedback loops for stable-platform applications. An electronic autocollimator is typically calibrated to read the actual mirror angle. The dioptic power of a bifocal segment. Objects may appear to have a doubling or ghosting effect. May exist alone or in combination with nearsightedness. Cylinder a - The meridian of a cylinder lens in which there is least or no curvature. Optical a - An imaginary line joining the centers of curvature of a lens or symmetrical optical system. base curve - The meridian of least curvature on a cylindrical surface. This defect of an optical system causes the image to be surrounded by a halo of colors. It is corrected in an achromatic lens system. Its function is to assist in the changing of the crystalline lens in the act of accomodation. They are sensitive to color, much less sensitive to motion. This lens is used to correct refractive errors including irregularly shaped cornea as a cosmetic lens to change iris color or to cover unsightly scars. The radius of curvature, about 8.00 mm is less than the sclera. (about 75%) of the dioptric power of the eye. This increases its dioptic power to focus the eye upon objects near to the eye.

The reciprocal of the focal length of a lens or optical system expressed in meters. 1 meter focal length = 1/1 = 1.00D., 0.50 meter focal length 1/.5 = 2.00D., 0.20 meter focal length = 1/.2 = 5.00D. focus - A point through which rays of light converge or from which rays of light appear to diverge when entering or emerging from an optical system. Finally the peripheral nerve fibers of the retina are atrophied, ending with blindness of central vision for total blindness. index of refraction - The ratio of the velocity of light in one medium to the velocity of light in the next medium. infinity (optical) - A distance which is great as compared with the aperture or focal length of an optical system. Six meters (20 feet) the distance used for refraction is over 1000 times the width of the pupil and about 400 times the focal length of the eye. At 6 meters the size of the pupil subtends an angle of less than 4 seconds at the first nodal point. lens - A transparent medium bounded by two geometrically describable surfaces one of which shall be curved - that is, spherical, cylindrical, toroidal or aspheric. Visible light is that part of the spectrum that produces the sensation of sight in the human eye. The wavelengths of the radiation in this visible range are very small and are usually expressed in either millimicrons or nanometers. The values given for the limits of the range of wavelengths in visible light will depend on the textbook you are reading, but will be around 380 - 760 nanometers or 400 - 750 nanometers. Each color of the spectrum, blue, green, yellow, and orange, will have a range of wavelengths up to red at around 660 - 750 nanometers. magnification - The property of some optical lenses or systems of projecting a real inverted image of larger area than the object.\n\nQuestion: a concave mirror can form a real image which is a copy of an object that forms\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They continued releasing commercially-successful movies with the horror-comedy parodies starring the comedy duo Abbott and Costello, and a few monster movies including the classic Creature from the Black Lagoon. In March 1951, Universal Pictures premiered Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man. The science fiction comedy depicts the misadventures of two private detectives investigating the murder of a boxing promoter. The film was part of a series in which the legendary comedy duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello meet classic characters from Universal's stable, including Frankenstein, the Mummy and the Keystone Kops. The special effects in the movie, which depicted invisibility and other optical illusions, were created by Stanley Horsley, son of cinema pioneer David Horsley.

Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. The songs featured on the album are not from his large collection of Top 40 hits, but are instead album tracks that have filled out his unique ability to cleverly tell stories that have made him one of the most important songwriters of the past 50 years. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Working as a staff songwriter for Warner Brothers Music Publishing, he earned more public recognition when he wrote and produced nearly all of the tracks on Miki Howard's Atlantic Records debut album, Come Share My Love, including the top-ten R&B chart hit title track. Humes continued working with Howard, writing and producing several songs on her second album, Love Confessions, including (again) the title track. In 1956, for fear he would upset his fans, bandmates, and his record label, he released his first R&B single (called \"Lovable\") under the assumed name 'Dale Cooke'. Because his voice is distinctive, people were not fooled by the name Dale Cooke. The album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles with producer David Anderle, who Kristofferson first worked with on Full Moon, his first collaboration with wife Rita Coolidge. Anderle cut the number of musicians so that there was a smaller palette of sounds, and Mike Utley once more made a major contribution to the overall sound and feel, predominantly laid-back and down-tempo, as did Jerry McGee with some tasteful guitar and dobro.

Although film production in Los Angeles remains the most important center for the medium, Hollywood has become more international, thus it faces increasing competition, however, from other parts of the United States and from the Canadian cities of Vancouver, British Columbia and Toronto, Ontario as well as numerous other countries around the world such as Romania and Australasia that provide Hollywood with lower production costs. The motion picture and TV industries have helped create the image that defines Los Angeles across the world. Many tourists flock to see Hollywood-related landmarks such as the Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Sign. Principal photography for the series began on May 3, 2021, in London, United Kingdom. Filming moved to Marshall, North Carolina on September 24. Production on the series wrapped on November 5, 2021. Production on the pilot began in March 2012 in Vancouver, Canada. The series features two distinct timelines, which requires more specific planning in the filming schedule. Filming for the island flashbacks takes place in Vancouver's Whytecliff Park area, near beachfront homes. The production team is tasked with keeping the buildings out of camera frame.

Here sin can be equated with physical or mental sickness. Again in shloka 37, Krishna says “Gyanagni sarva karmani bhasmasat kurute tatha”. In other words, “as fire reduces fuel to ashes, the fire of knowledge reduces all karma to ashes”. In shloka 38, Krishna said “Na hi gyanena sa drisham pavitram ih vidyate” or in other words “there is no greater purifier than knowledge. This is further clarified in Ch II verse 65, where Krishna said “prasade sarva dukhanam hanirasya upjayte” or in other words “in peace all the troubles are destroyed”. Good morning, said a woman as she walked up to the man sitting on ground. This was a woman clearly accustomed to the finer things of life. Her coat was new. She was smiling -- her even white teeth displayed in dazzling rows. she asked. \"No,\" he answered sarcastically. \"I've just come from dining with the president. Now go away.\" The woman's smile became even broader. Suddenly the man felt a gentle hand under his arm. \"What are you doing, lady?\" \"I said to leave me alone. \"That's old Jack. What do you want with him?\" she asked. \"I'm going to get him something to eat and get him out of the cold for awhile.\" the homeless man resisted. \"What is all this, is this man in trouble?\" \"Having a person like that here is bad for business.\" Old Jack smiled a toothless grin. \"See, lady. I told you so. The woman turned to the cafeteria manager and smiled. I, sir, am Penelope Eddy, president and CEO of the company.\" \"Oh.\" The woman smiled again. \"I thought that might make a difference.\" \"Then, perhaps, a cup of coffee to go?\" \"Yes, ma'am. That would be very nice.\" \"That was not my intent. Believe it or not, I have a reason for all this.\" She sat down at the table across from her amazed dinner guest. She came to my office one frigid December morning looking her usual self—dressed simply but with a quiet elegance in tidy jeans, colorful T-shirt, and blazer. A single strand of pearls hugged the contours of her clavicles, showing off a youthful neck. Her hair was swept up in a simple knot at the back of her head, its smooth darkness only beginning to show traces of white. She smiled shyly at me as I entered the room and greeted her. I wasn't exactly sure what she meant. The breath came in with the normal whoosh of air flowing through a tube. But when exhaling, her chest was filled with a variety of musical sounds. This cacophony of different pitches and durations sounded like an orchestra of plastic horns warming up before a performance. He went to that peasant and, when he lamented that he could not feed six children, offered to take the littlest one. He threw her into the river, and she floated to a fisherman's house, and the fisherman raised her. She was beautiful, and one day when the baron was hunting, he saw her and his companion asked who she would marry. To cast her horoscope, he asked when she was born, and she told her story. He sent her to his brother, with a letter telling his brother to kill her. She fell among robbers, who altered the letter to say she should be married to his son, and his brother had the wedding held at \n\nA Pox Upon You. They won't talk about the blisters. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. In fact, when we do so, we are communicating that we are in the perfect position. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" \". .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" Have hope, there are great days ahead! \" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it\n\nThey reach for each other and exchange a kiss of sweet affection and deep relief.Her husband looks even more relieved than she.She can walk out of the doctor's office and resume her life.The world is radiant again, and she's glad.The patient takes her first full breath in weeks and exhales a world of worry.Everyone smiles with relief.

The year 1962 saw another significant recognition with James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins winning the Nobel prize for their discovery of the structure and significance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Watson and Crick are well-known for their significant contribution to the discovery of the helical structure of DNA. In 1953, they proposed a model in which DNA forms a double helix, consisting of two strands that are twisted around each other. By unraveling the structural foundation of DNA, Watson and Crick laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology. Overall, the collaboration between Watson and Crick, coupled with insights from other scientists, led to the unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and paving the way for numerous scientific advancements. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center.

The governor appoints the chief minister on the nomination of the legislative assembly. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha. The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India. India has a parliamentary system as defined by its constitution, with power distributed between the central government and the states. The President of India is the ceremonial head of the country and supreme commander-in-chief for all defence forces in India. However, it is the Prime Minister of India, who is the leader of the party or political alliance having a majority in the national elections to the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is the chief adviser to the President of India and the head of the Union Council of Ministers. India is regionally divided into States (and Union Territories) and each State has a Chief Minister who is the leader of the party or political alliance that has won a majority in the regional elections otherwise known \n\n State Assembly Elections that exercises executive powers in that State. The respective State's Chief Minister has executive powers within the State and works jointly with the Prime Minister of India or their ministers on matters that require both State and Central attention. Some Union Territories also elect an Assembly and have a territorial government and other (mainly smaller) Union Territories are governed by a person appointed by the President of India. The President of India dissolves the existing State government if necessary, and a new election is conducted. Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th and current president. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected.\n\nQuestion: who presides over the joint sessions of parliament\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Washington and his unanimous cabinet (including Jefferson) decided the treaty did not bind the U.S. to enter the war, since they stopped being in favor of the Revolution after they executed the King; instead Washington proclaimed neutrality. Nevertheless, he did seize the opportunity to purchase Louisiana in 1803. The broad similarities but different experiences between the French and American revolutions lead to a certain kinship between France and the United States, with both countries seeing themselves as pioneers of liberty and promoting republican ideals. While Greene campaigned in South Carolina and Georgia, Lafayette led Continental resistance to Cornwallis's army in Virginia. In August, Washington and French general Rochambeau left New York for Yorktown, intent on inflicting a decisive defeat against Cornwallis. The French Revolution found widespread American support in its early phase, but when the king was executed it polarized American opinion and played a major role in shaping American politics. President George Washington declared neutrality in the European wars, but the polarization shaped the First Party System. They supported the French Revolution in the wake of the execution of the king. Genet now began mobilizing American voters using French money, for which he was expelled by President Washington. After President Washington denounced the societies as unrepublican, they faded away. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the Jeffersonian Republican Party favored France \n\n Grasse to help the Americans, along with large land and naval forces. The French expeditionary force arrived in North America in July 1780. When news of this reached London in March 1782, the government of Lord North fell and Great Britain immediately sued for peace terms; however, France delayed the end of the war until September 1783 in\n\nQuestion: who helped the british in the french and indian war\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It's a descendant of the H1N1 virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide in the pandemic of 1918-1919, mixed in with recent strains of swine and bird flu viruses. The 1918 virus originated in birds and then jumped to humans. This year's virus apparently jumped from a pig to a 5-year-old boy in Veracruz, Mexico, who passed it on to other humans. It's the initials of two sugar proteins (their scientific names are hemagglutinin and neuramidinase) that sit on the surface of the virus and do its dirty work. A new combination, H2N2, cause a brief swine flu epidemic in 1957. The bird flu virus that is began in Southeast Asia a decade ago and has spread throughout the Old World is an H5N1 combination. They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. How does a new virus develop? Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up. How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919? That virus developed various changes over the years, so it's similar but not identical to its ancestor — like a grandson who resembles but also differs from his grandfather. So far, H1N1 is not as virulent as the previous strain, but that could change. Hence they are rushing to develop a vaccine by this fall. How does H1N1 virus jump from animals to humans? Usually the H protein on a pig or bird virus doesn't fit easily into the receptor of a human cell. So a person exposed to such a virus is unlikely to get infected. This gives rise to a new strain of H1N1 that's adapted to humans. Contact with infected pigs or birds no longer is necessary. How does one person catch H1N1 from others? The virus can be transmitted through the air — by a cough or a sneeze — or by a handshake or by touching an infected surface, such as a doorknob. Why is this disease seem to be more deadly in Mexico than in the U.S. or other countries? It's possible that many cases of mild disease in Mexico went undetected, making the mortality rate appear to be higher there than it does here. It's also possible that the virus strain in the U.S. differs slightly from the one in Mexico, making it less virulent. Why does H1N1 seem to attack healthy young adults more than sick and elderly people, who are most affected by the ordinary seasonal flu? Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission causes human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Signs and symptoms In pigs, a swine influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. Although mortality is usually low (around 1–4%), the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Pigs have often been seen as \"mixing vessels\", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans. Humans Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (zoonotic swine flu). Virology Transmission Between pigs Influenza is quite common in pigs, with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US. Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries. Intensive farming may also increase the risk of transmission, as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other. The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses, or through dried mucus. Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection. The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd, infecting all the pigs within just a few days. Transmission may also occur through wild animals, such as wild boar, which can spread the disease between farms. To humans People who work with poultry and swine, especially those with intense exposures, are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers. Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs Pigs are unusual as they can be infected with influenza strains that usually infect three different species: pigs, birds, and humans. Pigs are a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes, producing new and dangerous strains. Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. These H5N1 infections may be quite common; in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java, where avian flu had broken out, five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative. It is an enveloped virus; the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Classification Of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu, two also cause influenza in pigs, with influenza A being common in pigs and influenza C being rare. Influenza B has not been reported in pigs. Within influenza A and influenza C, the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct, although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine, avian, and human species boundaries. Influenza C Influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs, but do not infect birds. Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past. In the southern hemisphere 15 to 33% of \n\nA H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs. Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype. What are the symptoms in humans? Humans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. The concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. What is the best way to keep from spreading the virus through coughing and sneezing?

He himself depicted the irrational and unconscious aspects of the human soul in allegorical terms, which can be seen as a precursor to psychoanalytic concepts. This renewed interest is driven by the growing focus on affective syndromes and the desire to trace and identify affective pathology in artists and writers, both living and deceased. It has been shaped by the reductionist and nosological approach of psychiatry, the influence of romanticism and modernism in art, as well as the psychoanalytic movement. These critics considered folk music (as produced by \"the folk\", i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Romantic medicine is part of the broader movement known as Romanticism, most predominant in the period 1800–1840, and involved both the cultural (humanities) and natural sciences, not to mention efforts to better understand man within a spiritual context ('spiritual science'). Romanticism in medicine was an integral part of Romanticism in science. The impetus for Romantic ideas in medicine came from \n\n In Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel. In Germany, the Sturm und Drang period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the century. The conservative Biedermeier style conflicts with the radical Vormärz in the turbulent period separating the end of the Napoleonic wars from the Revolutions of 1848. In Denmark, the early 19th century Golden Age produced prolific literary authors such as Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen. In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the Belle Époque, with its Fin de siècle retrospectively appeared as a \"golden age\" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nQuestion: when did the romanticism period start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They won't talk about the blisters. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" \". .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\" As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" Have hope, there are great days ahead! \" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it.\n\nQuestion: who sings ive loved you for a thousand years\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In early 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple stock market crashes have led to bear markets across the world, many of which are still ongoing. On March 16, 2020, after it became clear that a recession was inevitable, the DJIA dropped 12.93%, or 2,997 points, the largest point drop since Black Monday (1987), surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.32%, and the S&P 500 Index dropped 11.98%. By the end of May 2020, the stock market indices briefly recovered to their levels at the end of February 2020. In June 2020 the Nasdaq surpassed its pre-crash high followed by the S&P 500 in August and the Dow in November. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government intervention to remedy during the period. A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles. There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.

Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. The songs featured on the album are not from his large collection of Top 40 hits, but are instead album tracks that have filled out his unique ability to cleverly tell stories that have made him one of the most important songwriters of the past 50 years. In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. To date, it is the last studio album Taylor has released, and he has been performing songs form the album on his current concert tour. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Included on the album is the now classic “Angels of Fenway,” a tribute to the Boston Red Sox World Series championship season in 2004.

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men were honor bound by civic obligation to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen.

The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. Before the 1760s, Britain's American colonies had enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were locally governed by colonial legislatures. The conservatives believed themselves to be leading and protecting the economic development of the colony. William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales. The reformist attorney general, John Plunkett, sought to apply Enlightenment principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to emancipists, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and Aboriginal peoples.\n\nQuestion: when did the tradition of self government began in america\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He appears in a number of Hindu texts, notably the Mahabharata, telling Yudhishtira the story of Prahlada and the Ramayana as well as in the Puranas. He is also referred to as Rishiraj, meaning the king of all sages or rishis. Balasubramaniam is derived from the Sanskrit words balu meaning \"young\" and Subramaniam (itself derived from the Sanskrit words su, meaning \"auspicious\" and brahmanyam, translated loosely as \"auspicious effulgence of the Supreme Spirit\"). By extension, it refers to the Hindu god Murugan as a child or young man, the way the term Balakrishna refers to the young Krishna. In Kannada, the name is transliterated as Balasubrahmanya or Balasubramanya.

He was Independent India's first law minister and the principal architect of the Constitution of India. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture. Therefore, he was associated with the Ambedkarite movement from his student days. After completing his college education, he became active in the Republican Party of India. He was instrumental in the development of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Bhavan of Delhi. He played an important role in the making of the Indian Constitution. He inspired by B. R. Ambedkar and was a supporter of the mission by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. He was the first and only surviving child of Ramabai Ambedkar and Babasaheb Ambedkar, Indian polymath, human rights activist, and the father of the Constitution of India. He had four children, including Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar. Rajagopalachari's interest in public affairs and politics began when he commenced his legal practice in Salem in 1900. Inspired by Indian independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, he later became a member of the Salem municipality in 1911. In 1917, he defended Indian independence activist P.

After several weeks of significant hesitation, Mahendra asked Koirala to form a government, which took office in May 1959. Koirala led his country's delegation to the United Nations and made carefully poised visits to China and India, then increasingly at odds over territorial disputes. His land reform measures, especially the revision of the tenancy laws so easily passed by parliament, deeply offended the landed aristocracy which had long dominated the army.

Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth. Anterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment. Diastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth). Diastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. The gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics. It is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws. Periodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation. The frenum is an extension of our gum in between specific teeth like central incisors, anteriorly and the molars, posteriorly. Gum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema. Periodontitis, on the other hand, affects structures surrounding the teeth, majorly underlying bone structure. Because of compromised bone structure and periodontal ligaments, mobility appears in teeth, hence the drifting and diastema. In cases of high frenal attachments, frenectomy can be done. This is a simple procedure that relieves the pressure on the teeth and drifting stops. In all of the cases mentioned above, after treating the underlying causes, fixed orthodontic therapy should be done followed by retention appliances. So, if you have a void in your dental arch, then visit your dentist as soon as possible. If you want to maintain a good esthetics, then the gap between teeth shouldn’t be ignored as our jaws expand over time. Over the period, the size of the diastema might enlarge and cause functional problems. This can exert pressure on the front teeth, causing them to move forward and create gaps. Normally, the tongue rests against the roof of the mouth, which helps promote proper jaw and teeth alignment. These changes further contribute to malocclusion and may require orthodontic intervention to correct. It's important to address tongue thrust early on to minimize the potential impact on dental development. It is crucial to address both the digit sucking habit and tongue posture to prevent and correct any dental and skeletal misalignments that may arise. Crowding refers to the lack of sufficient space in the dental arch to accommodate all the teeth properly. Crowding is often caused by genetic factors, early loss of primary teeth, or improper oral habits such as thumb sucking. It can involve a single tooth or a group of teeth and may occur on one side or both sides of the mouth. Gaps between teeth can be caused by various factors. One common cause is size mismatch, where the size of the teeth is smaller compared to the size of the jaw bone. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. Furthermore, gum disease and tooth loss can contribute to the formation of gaps. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. Gaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. In some cases, the labial frenum extends down and between the two front teeth, creating a gap. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth. Traditional Orthodontics: Traditional orthodontics is highly effective at closing gaps between teeth. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a \"milk-white\" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called \"play\" and the \"leathern orb\" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, \n\n umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches. The first written \"Laws of Cricket\" were drawn up in 1744. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart\". In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term \"the Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when \n\n a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time.\n\nQuestion: when did cricket go to 6 ball overs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. Academicians have identified four reliable theories on the origin of the Chinese dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder and nature worship. Dragon boat racing was historically situated in the Chinese subcontinent's southern-central \"rice bowl\"; where there were rice paddies, so there were dragon boats, too. Of the twelve animals which make up the traditional Chinese zodiac, only the Dragon is a mythical creature. All the rest are non-mythical animals, yet all twelve of the zodiac creatures were well known to members of ancient Chinese agrarian communities. The dragon dance is often performed during Chinese New Year. The dragons are believed to possess qualities that include great power, dignity, fertility, wisdom and auspiciousness. Another ritual called Awakening of the Dragon involves a Taoist priest dotting the bulging eyes of the carved dragon head attached to the boat. In modern dragon boat festivals, a representative can be invited to step forward to dot \n\n  The Chinese dragon is one of the most important mythical creatures in Chinese mythology, considered to be the most powerful and divine creature and the controller of all waters who could create clouds with their breath. For example, the Chi of mythology lacks horns. Dragons often chase or play with a mystical or flaming pearl. A dragon-fenghuang pairing is a common motif in art, the fenghuang often being called a \"phoenix\".

Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology. Biography Early life Steven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth—an insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis. Reppert continues to rear cecropia from egg to adult each summer. Education and career Reppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology. He is the principal inventor on seven patents derived from his research. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.” This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals. To determine the function of mPER1–3, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them. Negative transcriptional feedback loop Reppert and colleagues discovered that the two mouse cryptochromes, mCRY1 and mCRY2, function as the primary transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression, and the mPER proteins are necessary for CRY nuclear translocation. This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock. In 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2. Monarch butterfly migration Since 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration. Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000 km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico. Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants. Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism. Legislation was introduced to make it the national insect of the United States, but this failed in 1989 and again in 1991. Efforts are underway to establish these monarch waystations. An IMAX film, Flight of the Butterflies, describes the story of the Urquharts, Brugger, and Trail to document the then-unknown monarch migration to Mexican overwintering areas. Sanctuaries and reserves have been created at overwintering locations in Mexico and California to limit habitat destruction. These sites can generate significant tourism revenue. Organizations and individuals participate in tagging programs. The 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver, Flight Behavior, deals with the appearance of a large population in the Appalachians. It may be the most familiar North American butterfly, and is considered an iconic pollinator species. Its wings feature an easily recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of 8.9–10.2 cm (3 1⁄2–4 in) A Müllerian mimic, the viceroy butterfly, is similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra black stripe across each hindwing. The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its annual southward late-summer/autumn instinctive migration from the northern and central United States and southern Canada to Florida and Mexico. During the fall migration, monarchs cover thousands of miles, with a corresponding multigenerational return north. The western North American population of monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains often migrates to sites in southern California, but has been found in overwintering Mexican sites, as well.
