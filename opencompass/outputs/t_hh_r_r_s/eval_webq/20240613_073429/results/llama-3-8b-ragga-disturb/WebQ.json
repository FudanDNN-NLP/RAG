Polk's narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution. Polk was also elected to the Kent County Levy Court in 1819. In 1826, the Federalist Party selected Polk as their candidate for governor, and after a hard-fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the Democratic-Republican candidate, David Hazzard. James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 – June 15, 1849) was the 11th president of the United States (1845–1849). Polk was born in North Carolina. He later lived in and became Governor of the state of Tennessee. A Democrat, and an ardent supporter of Andrew Jackson, Polk served as Speaker of the House (1835–1839) and Governor of Tennessee (1839–1841) before becoming president. During his single four-year term, Polk accomplished every major goal that he set for his administration and successfully managed the Mexican–American War, obtaining for the United States most of its present contiguous land area. In the general election, Calhoun offered his endorsement to Polk on condition that he support the annexation of Texas, oppose the Tariff of 1842, and dissolve the Washington Globe, the semi-official propaganda organ of the Democratic Party headed by Francis Preston Blair. He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy.

The following is a list of the longest-serving actors from soap operas all over the world. As of 2021, William Roache holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-serving actor in a television soap opera, having played Ken Barlow on Coronation Street since 1960. Chris Dormer played the role from 1970 to 1972 when the 7-year-old actor was written out of the soap due to his parents' emigration to Canada. On-screen Peter and his sister Susan were written out of the soap to live with their grandparents when their mother Valerie Barlow was killed off. One of the seven actors who has portrayed the character is Linus Roache, the real-life son of William Roache who portrays Peter's father, Ken Barlow in the programme. Linus returned to the show in 2010, playing Lawrence Cunningham, another son of Ken Barlow. Roache has appeared on popular television shows such as Cold Blood and Four Seasons before going on to join the cast of Coronation Street alongside his father and older brother as part of a storyline surrounding Ken Barlow and his long-lost son, played by his real-life son Linus. Linus Roache played Roache's father Laurence on Coronation Street which saw the pair's relationship strained by Laurence's attitudes towards James' homosexuality. He then appeared in The Road to Coronation Street, playing a younger version of his father William Roache during the time Coronation Street creator Tony Warren was attempting to bring the soap to television. It was announced on 20 December 2010 that Roache would be joining the cast of Coronation Street full-time in 2011 reprising the role of James Cunningham.

Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo in E major, The concerto is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B (clarinet I playing in A in movement 2), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani in E and B, and strings. While Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's piano concertos consisted of the piano and orchestra working in tandem, in Beethoven's last two piano concertos, the pianist was the \"hero,\" the dominant and directional soloist. Also, in Mozart's concertos, the soloist was a virtuoso and more important than the composer; in Beethoven's, the pianist is a vector for the composer. Beethoven created the tradition of linking movements in concertos, especially the middle and the last. A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra. The earliest known English horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann \n\n1) Allegro assai ; 2) Andante in G major ; 3) Allegro di molto The Piano Concerto No. 16 in D major, K. 451, is a concertante work for piano, or pianoforte, and orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

One receives the real medicine; the other gets a placebo, and the researchers and the patients alike are blind to which is which. But where did the idea come from? Even scientists are surprised to learn that it was created by Benjamin Franklin. We don’t often think of Franklin’s scientific research except in terms of his work on electricity. He was the first meteorologist in America, the first geographer, the first oceanographer, an inventor of medical apparatus, and, least known of all, the first parapsychologist—a student of extraordinary and anomalous human functioning. It was in this last capacity that he created the blind protocol. In 1778 Franklin was in Paris, as America’s ambassador to the court of King Louis XVI, when the eighteenth century’s greatest medical rogue, Franz Anton Mesmer, arrived from Vienna, in a cloud of celebrity and controversy. Mesmer prudently decamped to Paris, which was where he encountered Franklin. Well-trained in both medicine and theology, Mesmer was a charming, rational, cultivated man; he commissioned several works composed by Mozart. But he also had a flamboyantly theatrical style and more than a whiff of the con; he had startling theories of illness and disturbing and erotically tinged methods of treatment. The sommambules sat holding hands around a large wooden tub filled with powdered glass and magnetized iron filings. They were relaxed and brought into rapport by the sweet haunting tones of the glass harmonica, an instrument invented, coincidentally, by Franklin. The effect was dramatic. And finally he would command them to awaken, rested and cured. It often worked, and Mesmer’s success made him popular with laypeople and feared by the medical establishment. It may be that he just observed that a relaxed trance state produced a kind of anesthesia that gave subjects physiological control over their bodies and minds. However it happened, he seems to have sincerely believed he had discovered a cure for all illnesses. It is clear, though, that he had no real insight into why the trances worked. What was called for, he realized, was some sort of impartial test. It gave the effects he achieved a certain gloss, electricity, magnetism, and gravity being the high-prestige research areas of the day. We now know that he plagiarized much of this from one of the most prominent and well-regarded English physicians of the previous generation, Richard Meade (1673-1754). He also mixed in some alchemy, proposing that there existed a universal “fluid” in all living forms that could flow from one organism to another and affect a patient’s health. When he arrived in Paris, the French medical establishment, alarmed as much by his entrepreneurial success as by his unfounded theories, denied him a license to practice medicine in the city. He got around it by partnering with a disciple, the already licensed Charles d’Eslon. The four physicians asked the Academy of Sciences to add some scientists to their number, and five were chosen, including Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen, and Franklin, known throughout the world as the man who had discovered electricity. Franklin was by now arguably the most famous man in the Western world. Or it may be that whatever the condition of his body, his mind and his curiosity were as vigorous as ever. Franklin was not up to traveling when the commission began its work, so the first meetings were held without him and without his thoughts about how such an evaluation should be undertaken. In place of Mesmer’s glass harmonica, a piano in the\n\n Benjamin Franklin ( –  April 17, 1790) was an American polymath who was active as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first United States postmaster general. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity.

In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird.

While most of Belgium was occupied, King Albert I continued to command the Belgian Army along a section of the Western Front, known as the Yser Front, through West Flanders from his headquarters in Veurne. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west.\n\nQuestion: what country did germany invade first in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to Robert Caro, \"On November 8, 1960, Lyndon Johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961.\" In 1988, Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential running mate of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, and a senator from Texas, took advantage of \"Lyndon's law\", and was able to retain his seat in the Senate despite Dukakis's loss to George H. W. Bush. Fellow Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson as senator, but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower. The United States foreign policy during the 1963-1969 presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson was dominated by the Vietnam War and the Cold War, a period of sustained geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Johnson took over after the assassination promising to keep Kennedy's policies and his team. During the convention he came into conflict with the Democratic front-runner, fellow senator John F. Kennedy. The two men compromised and the Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson would assume the presidency \n\n Lyndon B. Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas in 1908. He campaigned for the presidential nomination in 1960 but lost the nomination to John F. Kennedy.

This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.

The early modern predecessors of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Ireland and later including Scotland) included both an accessory union and aeque principali union. The union between England and Wales was an accessory union.

The film adaptation adds to Thorin's quest an arch-enemy in the form of the villainous orc leader Azog, as well as a history of enmity with Thranduil which began with a dispute between his grandfather Thrór and the Elvenking over the White Gems of Lasgalen. In his review, Erik Kain from Forbes wrote that Thorin stood out as a remarkable character with shades of dark and light, at once heroic and stubborn to a fault. In the 1982 game The Hobbit Thorin appears as an AI controlled character and one of his seemingly random actions (\"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold\", which occurs when the player does nothing for a while) became quite famous. In the 2003 video game, Thorin is voiced by Clive Revill. In An Unexpected Journey (2012), the One Ring was found by Bilbo Baggins (portrayed by Martin Freeman).

On the other hand, Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, suffered from tuberculosis, which caused her to cough up blood while singing at the piano when she was only twenty years old. Poe himself struggled with depression and alcoholism, and his health deteriorated over time.

These synthetic routes were initially developed by the compound's discoverer, A. W. Hoffmann. It allows for a stronger and more durable product while requiring less sulfur and lower vulcanization temperatures. This effect was first reported by researchers at Pirelli and Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The first U.S. postage stamps used starch-based adhesives when issued in 1847. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of \n\n Polymers of butadiene and isoprene had good elasticity after vulcanization, but were crumbly. In the fall of 1928 Bock had the idea to copolymerize dimethyl butadiene with isoprene and butadiene, respectively, to combine the positive mechanical properties. Both synthetic rubbers had mechanical properties almost comparable with natural rubber. In spring 1929 Bock replaced dimethyl butadiene by styrene. The styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), which he synthesized from styrene and butadiene as comonomers, was superior to natural rubber in abrasion properties and therefore especially useful for tire applications. The rubber was marketed with the brand name Buna S. Even today SBR is the most successful synthetic rubber in terms of trade volume (together with Polybutadiene (BR)).

It was applied to solid rubber tires, rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E.

The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process.

With Vivian and so many others, this is just not the case. While we have seen important progress we were positive that there was more that we could do to give her a voice. We became part of a very special community that we never knew existed. It was through this community that we learned of a movement to get kids to use assistive technology to communicate. We learned that a \"talker\" was a device, usually a tablet like an iPad, that had a collection of symbols that when pressed, uttered words or phrases that matched the symbols. My wife and I, both educators, were familiar with the idea of using symbols to communicate but had only seen very crude devices that did not allow for complex communication. We were worried that she wouldn't have role models who communicated using devices but we have been inspired by Stephen Hawking, the theoretical physicist, and Micah Fowler, the main character who plays J.J.

There are two shahadas: \"There is no god but God\" and \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\". The first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God. The Tawhid, which is the prayer that states \"no god but God\" is a major component of the Islamic faith, for it asserts the monotheistic aspect of Islam, promoting unity of God \n\n Muslims pray five times a day, with their prayers being known as Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (after midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), Isha (nighttime), facing towards Mecca. For example, the Maghrib prayer can be performed at any time after sunset and before the disappearance of the red twilight from the west. In a mosque, the muezzin broadcasts the call to prayer at the beginning of each interval. Because the start and end times for prayers are related to the solar diurnal motion, they vary throughout the year and depend on the local latitude \n\n The Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey and can support their family during their absence.

To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from Norway. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the Öresund Bridge.

Daylight hours differentiate significantly in northernmost Finland. The difference of longitude between the western (19°07′54″E) and easternmost points (31°35′12″E) of Finland results in a difference of approximately 48 minutes of solar time. At Muotkavaara – a tripoint border between Finland, Norway and Russia – three time zones meet during Finland's winter time; Central European Time (UTC+01:00) in Norway, Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00) in Finland, and Moscow Time (UTC+03:00) in Nikel, Russia. Daytime highs in Sweden's municipal seats vary from 19 C to 24 C in \n\n half of the country. Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia. In spite of the high latitude, Sweden often has warm continental summers, being located in between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and vast Russia.

Although Montgomery County and Washington County were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county. Important lawyers who practiced in Frederick included John Hanson, Francis Scott Key and Roger B. Taney. Frederick was also known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting about a half dozen major churches. That original colonial building was replaced \n\n As of the 2010 U.S. census, there were 65,239 people residing in Frederick city and roughly 27,000 households. In regard to minority group growth, the 2010 census data show the city's Hispanic population at 9,402, a 271 percent increase compared with 2,533 in 2000, making Hispanics/Latinos the fastest \n\n race group in the city and in Frederick county (267 percent increase). Frederick city had 3,800 Asian residents in 2010, a 128 percent increase from the city's 1,664 Asian residents in 2000. Frederick is located in Frederick County in the northern part of the state of Maryland. In relation to nearby cities, Frederick lies 46 mi west of Baltimore, 49 mi north and slightly west of Washington, D.C., 24 mi southeast of Hagerstown and 71 mi southwest of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Frederick is a city in and the county seat of Frederick County, Maryland. Frederick has long since been an important crossroads, located at the intersection of a major north–south Native American trail and east–west routes to the Chesapeake Bay, both at Baltimore and what became Washington, D.C. and across the Appalachian mountains to the Ohio River watershed. Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which accommodates general aviation, and Fort Detrick, a U.S. Army bioscience/communications research installation and Frederick county's largest employer.\n\nQuestion: what county is frederick md in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1858, Harper refused to give up her seat or ride in the \"colored\" section of a segregated trolley car in Philadelphia (97 years before Rosa Parks). That same year, Anglo-African Magazine published her essay \"Our Greatest Want,\" in which Harper linked the common religious trope of oppression of African Americans to the oppression \n\n Karen E. Quinones Miller was born in New York City to Marjorie Bayne Quinones and Jose Quinones. Her older brother, David Quinones, died in 2008. Miller dropped out of junior high school at the age of 13, and says she spent most of her youth running the streets of Harlem. Although she was not officially home-schooled, her parents both insisted that she continue her education on her own, and gave her an extensive reading list. It was then that her interest in Harlem history was born, as she read novels and poetry by Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, Nella Larsen, and Claude McKay. After her enlistment was over in 1985, she married Kenneth \n\n the Hebrew people while enslaved in Egypt. Throughout the two stanzas, Harper demonstrates the restricted relationship between an enslaved mother and her child, while including themes \n\n Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (September 24, 1825 – February 22, 1911) was an American abolitionist, suffragist, poet, teacher, public speaker, and writer. Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. As a young woman in 1850, she taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the AME Church.

President Roosevelt's death just two months after the Yalta Conference had a major impact. It may have exacerbated post-WWII miscommunication between America and the Soviet Union, which may have contributed to the onset of the Cold War. Premier Stalin's death, eight years after the conference, also had significant political implications. As the leader of the Soviet Union, his passing marked a transition in power and potential shifts in Soviet foreign policy. This had implications not only for the Soviet Union but also for international relations and the balance of power during the post-war era. Overall, the deaths of these three leaders within two decades after the Yalta Conference had far-reaching historical and political consequences. The history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953 covers the period of the Second World War and of victory against Nazi Germany while the USSR remained under the control of Joseph Stalin. Stalin sought to destroy his political rivals while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular a collectivization of agriculture and a development of heavy industry. Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization. Stalin's methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to \n\n Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, dies of a stroke.

In the Quran, God warns of grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife, and admonishes mankind that hellfire is prepared for the disbelievers. Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's creation is entirely to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other humans as well as animals and plants, by not oppressing them. The Quran repeatedly reminds the reader that the worldly life (ḥayāt ad-dunyā) is nothing but a test and to determine \n\n۝ SAY, God is one GOD; ; ۝ the eternal GOD: ; ۝ He begetteth not, neither is He begotten: ; ۝ and there is not any one like unto Him. and in the Ayat ul-Kursi (\"Verse of the Throne\"), which is the 255th verse and the powerful verse in the longest chapter (the 2nd chapter) of the Qur'an, Al-Baqarah (\"The Cow\") states:  In Islam, Allah is the unique, omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to God in other Abrahamic religions.

As illustrated in the Quran numerous times: \"... it [theQuran] is guidance for the righteous… for those who believe in the unseen\" (2:3-4). These verses are mentioned at the beginning of the Quran as core characteristics of a believer and consequently all six articles of faith are based on this notion of \"the unseen\". The Quran states that man (mankind) is unable to see God and his attributes.

The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton. The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons by the end of World War II. J. J. Thomson thought that the negatively-charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a sea of positive charge that was distributed across the whole volume of the atom. Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden came to have doubts about the Thomson model after they encountered difficulties when they tried to build an instrument to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of alpha particles (these are positively-charged particles emitted by certain radioactive substances such as radium). Thomson had encountered a similar problem in his work on cathode rays, which he solved by creating a near-perfect vacuum in his instruments. Rutherford didn't think he'd run into this same problem because alpha particles are much heavier than electrons.

By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and\n\nQuestion: what did the scientist chadwick discovered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sienna Miller signed as lead actress. Omar Sy, Jamie Dornan, Emma Thompson, Daniel Brühl, Alicia Vikander and Lily James were also set to star in the film. Dornan's appearance was later removed due to cuts and adjustments in the storyline and Lily James's role revealed to be a cameo. Dornan's scenes were added to the home release. In July 2014, it was reported that the film's title had been changed from Chef to Adam Jones, to avoid confusion with Jon Favreau's film Chef. Uma Thurman joined the cast around this time. According to Deadline Hollywood, as of July 28, 2014, Weinstein was calling the film Untitled John Wells project, until they could decide on a better title. On August 7, 2014, Matthew Rhys was added to the cast, playing chef Jones' rival, Reece. In July 2015, it was announced that the film had been retitled Burnt.

His work is characterised by lucid prose, biting social criticism, total opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism. As a writer, Orwell produced literary criticism and poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. Orwell himself wrote in 1946, \"Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution ... [and] that kind of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.\" The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination. In 1944 the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London home. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact. According to Orwell, the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in\n\nQuestion: what did george orwell died of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He graduated from Yale College in 1779, was a tutor there from 1781 to 1783, and studied law. In the 1796 United States presidential election he was a Federalist elector for President, supporting Federalist candidate John Adams against Democratic-Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson. After a period of consideration, he voted for the Tariff of 1828, which raised tariff rates. While Clay rallied support for the party in the West, he emerged as a leading National Republican in the Northeastern states. Despite his efforts and those of Clay, Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson decisively defeated President Adams in the 1828 election. John Quincy Adams took office in 1825 after defeating Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay in the 1824 presidential election. Like Monroe, Adams sought a geographically-balanced cabinet that would represent the various party factions, and he asked the members of the Monroe cabinet to remain in place for his own administration. Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the cabinet. Adams presided over a harmonious and productive cabinet. He was a Congregationalist (that is, Puritan) deacon.

It is named after former Bruin athlete Jackie Robinson, the first African-American Major League Baseball player of the modern era. In the 1940s, Dodger management, led by Branch Rickey and O'Malley’s father and partner, Walter, took the bold step to break baseball’s color barrier. In 1947, the Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson, the first African-American since 1884 to sign a Major League Baseball contract. Robinson made his Dodgertown debut on March 31, 1948 and hit a home run in his first at-bat. By the time Robinson took the field, the crowd of local white citizens in the stands ended up booing him off the field and he was not able to play.

Formerly having played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the NAL, a man named Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, sought Robinson as a perfect candidate to finally break the baseball color line. Robinson was still a target of many racist comments and slurs during his time in the majors. Despite this, Jackie Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. Born in Selma, Alabama, Matthews was enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute and, with the help of Booker T. Washington (the principal of the institute), enrolled at the Phillips Academy in 1900 and Harvard University in 1901.\n\nQuestion: who did jackie robinson first play for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Douglas. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy. To sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. Although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while reestablishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear that they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Although Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and was willing to run again, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's reelection bid in 1864. Lincoln considered several War Democrats for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General Benjamin Butler as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the president dispatched General Daniel Sickles to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Johnson was a Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, coming to office as the Civil War concluded.\n\nQuestion: who was vp for lincoln?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. The Bolsheviks established the first socialist state based on the ideas of soviet democracy and Leninism. With Lenin's death in 1924, there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the form of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition respectively. Eventually crushing all opponents, the RCP spread Soviet style rule quickly and established itself through all of Russia. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the RCP, became Lenin's successor and continued as leader of the Soviet Union into the 1950s. Under the leadership of Russian communist Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik Party seized power in the Russian Republic during a coup known as the October Revolution. Ruling by decree, Lenin’s Sovnarkom introduced widespread reforms confiscating land for redistribution among the permitting non-Russian nations to declare themselves independent, improving labour rights, and increasing access to education. One of the three powers that has emerged as a key player is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, led by Joseph Stalin. In First World War, after the October Revolution of November 1917, Communist Party leader Vladimir Lenin overthrew the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II.

Most squamous-cell carcinoma originates in the central portions of the lungs. Outside of the chest, lung cancer commonly spreads to the bones, brain, liver and adrenal glands. The type of cancer affects what treatment you should get. Another way to diagnose the tumor type is with sputum cytology, in which mucus from the lungs (sputum) is examined under a microscope to check for abnormal cells. Your doctor will choose a therapy based on size and location of the tumor or the presence of cancer cells. Without treatment, cancer will continue to grow. As with any cancer, even if squamous-cell lung cancer disappears (goes into remission) after treatment, there is a chance it can come back again. To prevent squamous-cell lung cancer, quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Tobacco smoke is the main risk factor for most types of lung cancer. Survival rates after surgery vary. For those with stage I disease, the five-year survival rate is about 47 percent. For those with stage III disease, the five-year survival rate is 8 percent. More extensive carcinoma might require removal of a lobe of a lung or the entire lung. Squamous cell carcinoma usually is diagnosed after the disease has spread. The overall prognosis for all non-small-cell lung cancers is poor, with a five-year survival rate of about 15 percent. The survival rate is higher (close to 50 percent) when the cancer is detected and treated early. Even when surgery and other therapies are initially successful, there is a high risk of the cancer coming back. His sister, Annie Hinsche-Wilson-Karges, was married to the group's guitarist, Carl Wilson. Hinsche died after a short battle with lung cancer on November 20, 2021. His mother, Celia Hinsche, also died on the same day. A couple of years later, in 1988, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his pharynx and larynx. He underwent surgery and radiation treatments several times. Nine years later, on May 26, 1997, he died of the complications of his disease in the arms of his wife at 55 years old. In the United States, lung cancer causes more deaths than all other types of cancers. It is crucial to diagnose and treat lung cancer as early as possible for effective treatment. Approximately 25% of lung cancer cases do not display symptoms. Certain types of lung cancer are highly aggressive and spread quickly through the body. The generic five-year survival rate for lung cancer is roughly 15%. It is the leading cause of worldwide cancer-related deaths, accounting for roughly 1.3 million deaths a year. This death toll is higher than that of colon, prostate, and breast cancer deaths combined. The majority of lung cancer cases are carcinomas, or malignancies arising from epithelial cells that line the airways of the lungs. There are two main types of primary lung cancer: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma. There are other types of lung cancer that are more rare, including carcinoid tumors, glandular tumors, and undifferentiated carcinomas. There are three subtypes of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common, accounting for nearly 40% of lung cancer cases. These carcinomas are typically found close to larger airways. Large-cell carcinoma accounts for roughly 9% of lung cancers. SCLC is also known as oat-cell carcinoma due to its flat shape. As its name implies, this carcinoma’s cells are smaller than the body’s normal cells. This lung cancer has a strong association with smoking. It is typically treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as opposed to surgery. Smoking accounts for 80% to 90% of lung cancer cases. “Lung cancer campaign targets late diagnosis: encouraging patients to present earlier would save lives.” Nursing Standard.

Comprising east-central and southeastern Russell County, it includes the city of Dorrance, which is located in the west-central part of the township, and it borders Fairview Township to the north, Lincoln County's Pleasant Township to the northeast, Lincoln County's Highland Township and Ellsworth County's Wilson and Noble Townships to the east, Barton County's Cleveland and Beaver Townships to the south, Center Township to the west, and Luray Township to the northwest. State Route 252 (SR 252) is a south&ndash;north road in Williamson County, Tennessee that connects Arrington with Brentwood. Located on the Highland Rim, Cookeville's elevation (1100 ft AMSL) is a few hundred feet higher than either Nashville or Knoxville. As a result, temperatures and humidity levels are generally slightly lower in Cookeville than in either the Nashville Basin or in the Tennessee Valley. Cookeville is situated in the Upper Cumberland region of Tennessee near the crossroads of I-40, SR 136, and US 70N-SR 24. The city is located 79 miles east of Nashville and 101 miles west of Knoxville. Three man-made lakes maintained by the Corps of Engineers are located near Cookeville, created to help flood control in the narrow valleys of the Cumberland Plateau: Center Hill Lake, Cordell Hull Lake, and Dale Hollow Lake.

Under the tutelage of a master thief an adolescent Munroe became a skilled pickpocket, the means of which she meets through coincidence the powerful mutant Professor X. Professor X later convinces Munroe to join the X-Men and use her abilities for a greater cause and purpose. They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a postgraduate degree in the American Southwest – where they occasionally encountered the Hulk – and helping out Moira MacTaggert at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. Xavier trains her in the use of her telekinesis, while inhibiting her telepathic abilities until she matures. Around this time, he also starts working with fellow mutation expert, Karl Lykos, as well as Moira MacTaggert again, who built a mutant research station on Muir Island. Apparently, Charles had gotten over Moira in his travels to the Greek island of Kirinos. Xavier discusses his candidates for recruitment to his personal strike force, the X-Men, with Moira, including those he passes over, which are Kurt Wagner, Piotr Rasputin, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, and Ororo Munroe. She reforms the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for another assassination attempt on Senator Kelly, and kidnaps Moira MacTaggert and impersonates her in order to access her research on the Legacy Virus. Mystique uses samples of the Legacy Virus to create a biological weapon that would infect humans and not mutants, and develops a cure for the Legacy Virus. Mystique then shoots Moira's foster daughter Wolfsbane with a prototype of Forge's neutralizer gun, depowering her. With Moira, she is transported to an alternate Earth where Britain is dominated by Nazis. Meanwhile, the Nazi counterparts of Callisto and Moira appear on the mainstream Earth.

Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings. Da Vinci's anatomical studies were groundbreaking during his time and greatly advanced the understanding of human anatomy. Furthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. The anatomical knowledge he gained improved his ability to portray the human form, leading to the creation of masterpieces such as \"The Last Supper\" and the iconic \"Vitruvian Man.\" In addition to his artistic and scientific contributions, da Vinci's anatomical drawings also highlight his multidisciplinary approach as a true \"uomo universale\" or \"universal man.\" Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist. By virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form. These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giorgio Vasari. Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances. In his De Pictura (\"About Painting\") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which \n\n said that \"intensity of color does duty for intensity of sentiment.\" He copied Leonardo's Last Supper repeatedly, and one of his best copies is in the possession of the Royal Academy of Arts.

This legend about Ashoka's search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why Ashoka did not adopt Jainism, another major contemporary faith that advocates non-violence and compassion. The legend suggests that Ashoka was not attracted to Buddhism because he was looking for such a faith, rather, for a competent spiritual teacher. He was known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and was often praised by the \n\n Buddha's Birthday (also known as Buddha Jayanti, also known as his day of enlightenment - Buddha Purnima, Buddha Pournami) is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated in most of East Asia and South Asia commemorating the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Gautama Buddha, who was the founder of Buddhism. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–483 BCE in Lumbini. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment (on the day of the full moon) and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays. A story in Divyavadana attributes Ashoka's conversion to the Buddhist monk Samudra, who was an ex-merchant from Shravasti. According to this account, Samudra was imprisoned in Ashoka's \"Hell\", but saved himself using his miraculous powers. When Ashoka heard about this, he visited the monk, and was further impressed by a series of miracles performed by the monk. A story in the Ashokavadana states that Samudra was a merchant's son, and was a 12-year-old boy when he met Ashoka; this account seems to be influenced by the Nigrodha story. Another story claims that the young boy ate 500 Brahmanas who were harassing \n\n Buddhism in Nepal started spreading since the reign of Ashoka through Indian and Tibetan missionaries.

In the case of dyslexia and logographic Chinese characters, individuals with dyslexia may have difficulty converting these characters into their meanings. Additionally, the relationship between phonological capacity (the ability to process and manipulate speech sounds) and reading appears to be influenced by orthography - the way a language's writing system represents its sounds. In contrast, in logographic systems like Chinese characters, individuals with dyslexia may struggle with mapping characters to their meanings. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. There are and have been several Chinese alphabets, that is pre-existing alphabets adapted to write down the Chinese language. There is no original alphabet native to China. However, there were attempts to replace the whole Chinese script with alphabets but failed in the end, so the Chinese characters were kept. including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. Zhuyin (sometimes called Bopomofo) is a semi-syllabary used to phonetically transcribe Mandarin Chinese in the Republic of China. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary.\n\nQuestion: what do you call the chinese writing system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\". The collapse of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise. Before 1991, many thought that the collapse of the Soviet Union was impossible. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill. Due to the large military buildup of the 1960s the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule.

The consensus on 'the antiquity of man' was established by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, just two months before the publication of Charles Darwin's influential work, \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. This consensus, including the understanding that humans had a long history on Earth, provided a crucial foundation for the intelligibility and eventual acceptance of evolution by natural selection. Charles Darwin's studies at the University of Cambridge included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history. In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend \"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\" He later stated in \n\n that have been subjected repeatedly to tests of evidence which attempt to disprove or falsify them. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in On the Origin of Species in 1859. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories \n\n its time, it offered a new theory. One hundred years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had a significant impact on ecology. English translation: ; In September 1838 Charles Darwin conceived his theory of natural selection as the cause of evolution, then as well as developing his career as a naturalist worked privately on finding evidence and answering possible objections, circulating essays written in 1842 and 1844 to his friends. He wrote his paper On The Tendency of Varieties \n\nThroughout history, there have been several significant discoveries in the field of biology. Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection (1859): Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection revolutionized our understanding of the process of evolution.

Spanish, though not an official language, is spoken by a growing percentage of the Haitian population. French has been the primary language in Haitian politics since the colonial era, with Haitian Creole being held in low regard by the nation's ruling class. Haitian Creole is a combination of basic French structures with significant loanwords from African languages, and major differences in grammar and spelling. This original demotion of the Creole language created socioeconomic barriers for the country's majority which primarily spoke only Haitian Creole. Per the 1987 Constitution, both Creole and French are official languages of Haiti. Spanish is spoken by some Haitians who live along the Haitian-Dominican border. English and Spanish may also be spoken by Haitian deportees from the United States and various Latin American countries. Overall, about 90-95% of Haitians only speak Haitian Creole/French fluently, with over half only knowing Creole.

Darwin's embrace of surprise and serendipity fueled his scientific exploration and revolutionized our understanding of biology. These serendipitous moments often occur when scientists or researchers are open-minded, observant, and willing to explore unexpected outcomes. Charles Darwin's studies at the University of Cambridge included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history. He later stated in \n\n  Alfred Russel Wallace (8 January 1823 – 7 November 1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, biologist and illustrator. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the \n\n its time, it offered a new theory. One hundred years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had a significant impact on ecology. English translation: ; In September 1838 Charles Darwin conceived his theory of natural selection as the cause of evolution, then as well as developing his career as a naturalist worked privately on finding evidence and answering possible objections, circulating essays written in 1842 and 1844 to his friends. He wrote his paper On The Tendency of Varieties \n\nThe main point of Darwin's theory is that organisms with traits that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations.Since that fateful day, the genes for other diseases, such as Huntington's disease, inherited forms of breast cancer, sickle cell anemia, Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy, have been found. Through his experiments, Mendel established that genetic factors are passed from parents to offspring and remain unchanged in the offspring so that they can be passed on again to the next generation. Evolving the Theory of Natural Selection\n\nCharles Darwin's study of giant tortoises and finches on the Galapagos Islands led to his famous theory of natural selection (also known as \"survival of the fittest\"), which he published in his 1859 book titled On the Origin of Species. The main point of Darwin's theory is that organisms with traits that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations.Thus, over time, the traits seen in a population of organisms in a given area can change.The significance of Darwin's theory of natural selection can be seen today in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Formulating Cell Theory\n\nIn 1839, zoologist Theodor Schwann and botanist Matthias Schleiden were talking at a dinner party about their research.\n\nQuestion: what was the book written by charles darwin?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was a Dutch biologist known as the \"Father of Microbiology.\" He is credited with improving the design of the microscope and making groundbreaking observations using his highly advanced microscopes. Van Leeuwenhoek discovered and described various microorganisms, such as bacteria, protists, and sperm cells, providing valuable insights into the microscopic world. Hooke's book \"Micrographia\" published in 1665 showcased his observations and discoveries, including the first recorded observation of biological cells, which he named \"cells\" due to their resemblance to living quarters of monks. By utilizing the microscope, he identified cellular changes associated with cancer, revolutionizing the field of cytopathology. These scientists played critical roles in improving microscope design, expanding our understanding of microscopic structures, and pioneering various research techniques. Their contributions have paved the way for countless advancements in medicine and scientific research. He also recognized the binding of oxygen to erythrocytes as a function of hemoglobin, which in turn creates the compound oxyhemoglobin. Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the famous 17th century microscopist, discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call dental plaque). The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. One of the most notable figures associated with the microscope is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist in the 17th century. Leeuwenhoek is often considered the father of microbiology for his groundbreaking observations using microscopes he designed himself. He was the first to accurately describe and document microorganisms like bacteria, red blood cells, and spermatozoa. His discoveries laid the foundation for our understanding of the microscopic world. In this work, he coined the term \"cell\" after observing the cellular structure of cork.\n\nQuestion: what did anton van leeuwenhoek contribute to our knowledge of cells?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

With the development of Jīnwén (Bronzeware script) and Dàzhuàn (Large Seal Script) \"cursive\" signs continued. The Ancient Chinese (mainly in the Shang dynasty), would write their questions on the oracle bone, and burn the bone, and where the bone cracked \n\n The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script yet discovered is the body of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze from the late Shang dynasty. There have recently been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings dating back to c. 6000 BC, like Jiahu Script, Banpo Script, but whether or not the carvings are complex enough to qualify as writing is under debate. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. The script was originally used as a prompt for the recitation of ritual texts. For inventories, contracts, and letters, the geba script was used. As its purpose need not expand to the realm of daily use among non-religious specialists—after all, literate Naxi today, as in the past, write in Chinese—at most it will presumably but continue to fulfill the needs of demon exorcism, amusing tourists and the like.\" The Ba–Shu scripts are three undeciphered scripts found on bronzeware from the states of Ba and Shu in the Sichuan basin of southwestern China in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Numerous signature seals have been found in Ba–Shu graves, suggesting that the states used written records, though none have been found.

El Cuartelejo was inhabited by semi-nomadic Apache Indians, known to archaeologists as the Dismal River culture. The first flight of the Pueblo to El Cuartelejo may have been in 1640 after Taos Indians killed their mission priest, Fray Pedro de Miranda. The Spanish sent out expeditions to try to force the Pueblos to come back to New Mexico. Spanish General Francisco Vásquez de Coronado went to North America to explore the land. Coronado dispatched Pedro de Tovar and other members of their party to find the Hopi villages. The Spanish wrote that the first Hopi village they visited was Awatovi. They warmly entertained Cardenas and his men and directed him on his journey. To identify sites for presidios and missions, an overland expedition of 67 men and 100 pack mules left San Diego in 1769.

It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. It is the Arabian Peninsula, excluding the areas where southern Arabian was spoken. The Egyptian, Sudanese, and Levantine dialects (including the Syrian dialect) are well documented, and widely spoken and studied. The \"Koiné\" dialect of the Greek language was important in Hellenistic Alexandria, and was used in the philosophy and science of that culture, and was later studied by Arabic scholars. In the upper Nile Valley, southern Egypt, around Kom Ombo and south of Aswan, there are about 300,000 speakers of Nubian languages; mainly Noubi, but also Kenuzi-Dongola. In Siwa Oasis, there is also the Siwi language that is spoken by about 20,000 speakers.

Roswell Park is among a select group of Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry was established at Roswell Park in 1981 by then-Chair of Gynecologic Oncology, M. Steven Piver, MD. In 1990, it was named The Gilda Radner Registry to honor the memory of American comedian Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Her husband, actor and producer Gene Wilder generously agreed to lend his late wife’s name to the registry in an effort to increase awareness of the disease and to help national research efforts. Under the direction of Dr. Odunsi, the Registry is investigating other genetic causes of ovarian cancer in order to better detect, prevent and treat the disease. Dr. Lele’s investigations include Gynecologic Oncology Group studies that include scientific and clinical research as well as innovations in ovarian cancer surgery and chemotherapy. She once lent $300 to John Belushi to fly to an audition for Animal House in California. She decided to make a film on Zen and Alan Watts volunteered to narrate the film.

She completed films about the world's spiritual and religious traditions (including documentaries such as Requiem for a Faith and The Sufi Way),and collaborated with Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell, Edgar Mitchell, Jean Houston, Ram Dass, Alan Watts, Huston Smith and Larry Dossey, among others.

In the book, he recounts Barack Obama's upbringing and early political career in Chicago and argues that Obama is an \"extreme leftis[t]\" who should not be elected president. The book claims to document \"Obama's extensive connections with Islam and radical politics\", his \"religious affiliation with ... black-liberation theology\", and his associations with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, fundraiser Tony Rezko, and radical activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, formerly of the Weather Underground. The book opens with a quote by Andy Martin, who The Nation, The Washington Post, and The New York Times have identified as the primary source for the allegations that Obama is concealing an alleged Muslim faith, rumors which began shortly after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Having attended Wright's sermon, Obama later adapted Wright's phrase \"audacity to hope\" to \"audacity of hope\" which became the title for his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and the title of his second book. While a Senate candidate, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, entitled The Audacity of Hope that propelled him to national prominence.

An understanding of how the firewall is able to achieve its functions through the capabilities a firewall is able to provide. These are the capabilities which determine the type of firewall to be sourced to meet a certain and specific set of security needs. The validation of the data packets is usually based on a number of factors which are the destination and the source internet protocol (IP) addresses, protocol, type of service, the source and the destination ports and port numbers, the differentiate services code point, the time range and a host of other parameters associated with the internet protocol header. These criteria are usually tested and matched for all individual packets so as to guarantee or deny these packets. This packet filtering comes about or rather is implemented through the use access control lists (ACL) which are found on switches and routers. Having seen these features of the packet filtering firewalls, the most obvious strong point for this type of firewall is that it is most common and can be found in about every component of the network. The downside with the packet filtering firewall is that it is static and has been exploited by hackers who channel suspicious traffic through the TCP 80 port which grants unobstructed access. This model seeks to explain the transmission of information from one computer to another application on a second computer. Encryption is done in this layer. The session layer is the fifth and manages service requests between computers. The transport layer provides reliable ordering and communication of data by preparing the data for delivery to the network transmission control protocol. It is also patches easily in case vulnerabilities are identified. The only disadvantage is that they are slow in the manner that they handle data and traffic. The difference lies in that the reverse proxy firewalls are deployed for the servers and not clients as in the case of application servers. These are the basic types of firewalls and which are chosen dependent on security needs and on to which many features have been added by different security vendors to make them better adapted for use. This is also evident and provides proof for it having such a slow rate of replication. It’s a growing field that’s\n\n described as a \"battle for access standards\". The United States Department of Defense (DoD) developed and tested TCP/IP during the 1970s in collaboration with universities and researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and France. IPv4 was released in 1981 and the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. By 1984, an international reference model known as the OSI model had been agreed on, with which TCP/IP was not compatible. Many governments in Europe – particularly France, West \n\n A packet-switched network transmits data that is divided into units called packets. A packet comprises a header (which describes the packet) and a payload (the data). The Internet is a packet-switched network, and most of the protocols in this list are designed for its protocol stack, the IP protocol suite. They use one of two transport layer protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). In the tables below, the \"Transport\" column indicates which protocol(s) the transfer protocol uses at the transport layer. Some protocols designed to transmit data over UDP also use a TCP port for oversight. In the case of FTP, this port differs from the listening port. Some protocols—including FTP, FTP Secure, FASP, and Tsunami—listen on a \"control port\" or \"command port\", at which they receive commands from the client. Similarly, the encryption scheme indicated in the \"Encryption\" column applies to transmitted data only, and not to the authentication system. On the ARPANET, the starting point for host-to-host communication in 1969 was the 1822 protocol which provided a reliable packet delivery procedure via an Interface Message Processor. The Network Control Program (NCP) for the ARPANET was first implemented in 1970. The designers of the NCP envisioned a hierarchy of protocols to enable Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) functions across the ARPANET. Networking research in the early 1970s by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf led to the formulation of the first version of the Transmission Control Program (TCP) in 1974. Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December as a monolithic (single layer) design. The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London, but it was not installed \n\n The UK Coloured Book protocols gained some acceptance internationally as the first complete X.25 standard. The design of the Transmission Control Program incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. In version 3 of TCP, written in 1978, the Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Internet Protocol (IP) as connectionless layer and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a reliable connection-oriented service. Originally referred to as IP/TCP, version 4 was installed\n\nQuestion: who developed the tcp ip reference model?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After resting for two weeks at Winchester, the division started, on May 2, under command of General William Rosecrans, and after crossing the Allegheny Mountains marched into western Virginia through Romney, and joined General John C. Frémont's Mountain Department forces. On May 24, Frémont forces started for the Shenandoah Valley to pursue Confederate Major General Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley. The regiment's first engagement occurred on June 8 at the Battle of Cross Keys, Virginia, in which Frémont's forces were defeated by a Confederate corps under command of Jackson. They arrived the day after the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and joined Pope's army in its retreat from that Confederate victory. After a series of minor actions along the Rappahannock, Pope's forces met Jackson's half of Lee's army near Manassas Station. Lee had divided his army into wings led by Jackson and Lt. Gen.

Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the Tallapoosa River.

Current governor Bill Lee was the president of his own company before taking office. Education varies, but typically recent governors hold at least a bachelor's degree. Though political experience is helpful for running for governor, it has never been a requirement. Bill Lee, for example, prior to his governorship never held office. Bredesen and Haslam were both mayors: Bredesen as mayor of Nashville from 1991 to 1999 and Haslam as mayor of Knoxville from 2003 to 2010. Early governors such as Andrew Jackson sometimes had a history of military service, with Jackson serving in the Revolutionary War. Governors such as Haslam focused on making the state business friendly as much as possible, using fiscally conservative ideas when making policy. His handling of TennCare, namely that he cut more than 170,000 people from the rolls for the sake of the budget, was criticized, and it played a role in his Senate race in 2018.

The operation was put onto a sound footing, and Callaway cashed out his stock in the operation, determined to leave the textile business. Callaway worked as secretary-treasurer of the company, later known as Kex Plant, and continued to reinvest his profits over the subsequent two decades. He opened several other mills within a 100-mile radius of LaGrange. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney changed the face of agriculture in the American South. Whitney's gin was produced in response to the state of Georgia's appointed commission for the promotion of a gin suitable to remove seed from fibers on the short-staple, green-seed cotton.

Lusitanic is a term used to refer to people who share the linguistic and cultural traditions of the Portuguese-speaking nations, territories, and populations, including Portugal, Brazil, Macau, Timor-Leste, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea Bissau and others, as well as the Portuguese diaspora generally. The term is derived from Lusitanian ('person of Lusitania', Lusitano, Luso, fem. Lusitana, Lusa; from Lusitanicus, from Lusitania, the name of a Roman province in the Iberian Peninsula, which encompassed most of modern Portugal). Luso- is a Late Latin prefix used to denote Portugal/Portuguese, in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. A Lusophone (Lusófono/a) is someone who speaks the Portuguese language, either natively or as an additional language. In Portugal, the language is regulated by the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, Class of Letters and its national dialect is called European Portuguese. This written variation is the one preferred by Portuguese ex-colonies in Africa and Asia, including Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Angola, Timor-Leste, Macau and Goa. The written form of Portuguese used in Brazil is regulated by the Brazilian Academy of Letters and is sometimes called Brazilian Portuguese (although the term primarily means all dialects \n\n found to significantly increase over the last eight to ten years. Currently, Portuguese is spoken and taught as a second language for a small, but significant, and important collective of Goans. In 1911, following the establishment of the Portuguese republic, a wide orthographic reform was adopted – the Orthographic Reform of 1911 – which completely modified the face of the written language, bringing it closer to contemporary pronunciation. However, this reform was made without any agreement with Brazil, leaving both countries with two entirely different orthographies: Portugal with its reformed orthography, Brazil with its traditional orthography (called pseudo-etimológica, \"pseudo-etymological\").\n\nQuestion: what do portuguese people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. Renowned his charismatic \n\nLouis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 - July 6), singer and trumpeter ; Charlie Shavers (August 3, 1920 – July 8), trumpet player ; Wynton Kelly (December 2, 1931 — April 12), pianist \n\n presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was extremely racially divided. Mitchell sang and drummed for James Reese Europe in 1918, and the following year founded a new group, which he called Louis Mitchell's Jazz Kings. Toward the end of the decade, Mitchell began touring Europe as well as the United States, concentrating on the United Kingdom and France.

Unlike the German Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini was officially only the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy. Initially the King and his staff (conscious of the Italian lack of preparation to war) did not approve Mussolini's intentions, but when France was clearly defeated in June 1940, the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was abruptly sent to war.

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious. Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. It will infect and destroy neurons involved in this process over the course of two days. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon. Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline. The following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. A search for the apparent surviving SCP-3105 victim has been initiated, but has yet to produce results. I’m not sure why I’m in the mountains, and I can’t remember driving here, but it’s nice. The cabin’s fully stocked with food. In the meantime, it looks like my kayak is still in serviceable shape. The sun wheels through the sky, dragging the shadows behind it. It seems to tarnish the firmament, turning the polished silver, yellow, then a blazing red. The mountains put out the fire, and the stars peer out from the endless darkness above. The river is wild, higher than I’ve ever seen it at this time of year. My kayak sustained some damage, so I don’t think I’ll be taking it out again until I can get back to town and repair it. I woke up in the cabin today.

Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work. In particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. Virchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. Von Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. Virchow's mentorship and his emphasis on cellular pathology, meticulous observation, and accurate documentation influenced these individuals in their respective fields. Some of the contributions and accomplishments of Virchow during his time in Berlin include:\n\n1. Pathological Anatomy: Virchow published numerous papers on pathological anatomy and began his six-volume \"Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie\" (Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics) while at Würzburg. Cellular Pathology: Virchow formulated theories on cellular pathology during his time at Würzburg. Anthropological Work: Virchow started his anthropological work, studying the skulls of cretins and investigating the development of the base of the skull. His anthropological research contributed to the understanding of human anatomy and the effects of various conditions on skeletal structures. He focused on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, hospital design, meat inspection, and school hygiene. He supervised the design of two new Berlin hospitals, opened a nursing school, and designed the city's sewer system. Virchow's contributions had a profound impact on medicine and public health, shaping our understanding of diseases, promoting advancements in anatomical research, and advocating for healthcare improvements. Jaenisch’s first breakthrough occurred in 1974 when he and Beatrice Mintz showed that foreign DNA could be integrated into the DNA of early mouse embryos. In 2007, Jaenisch’s laboratory was one of the \n\nRudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. This theory states that all living things are made up of one or more cells and that cells are the basic units of life. Although Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection. His contributions laid the foundation for further research in the field of biology and continue to influence the fields of molecular biology and genetics today. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843. At Würzburg Virchow published many papers on pathological anatomy. He began there the publication of his six-volume _Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie_ (\"Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"), most of the first volume of which he wrote himself. At Würzburg he also began to formulate his theories on cellular pathology and started his anthropological work with studies of the skulls of cretins (dwarfed, mentally deficient individuals) and investigations into the development of the base of the skull.\n\nQuestion: where did rudolf virchow conduct his research?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is best known for his 2006 discovery, published in the journal Science, showing that some patients thought to be in a persistent vegetative state are in fact fully aware and (shown subsequently) able to communicate with the outside world using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the 2019 New Year Honours List, Owen was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to scientific research. His first degree was in Psychology from University College London 1985–1988. As a student he shared accommodation with Psychologist and best-selling author Richard Wiseman. He was awarded The Pinsent Darwin Scholarship by the University of Cambridge in 1996 and returned to the UK to work at the newly opened Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Cambridge. His work has appeared in many of the world's most prestigious scientific and medical journals, including Science, Nature, The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. He has an h-Index of 112 according to Google Scholar. His early publications on patients with frontal or temporal-lobe excisions pioneered the use of touch screen based computerised cognitive tests in neuropsychology. His 2006 paper in the journal Science demonstrated for the first time that functional neuroimaging could be used to detect awareness in patients who are incapable of generating any recognised behavioural response and appear to be in a vegetative state. In a follow up paper in 2010 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Owen and his team used a similar method to allow a man believed to be in a vegetative state for more than 5 years to answer 'yes' and 'no' questions with responses that were generated solely by changing his brain activity using fMRI. This research attracted international attention from the world's media; it was reported in many hundreds of newspapers around the world (including twice on the front page of The New York Times'' and other quality journals) and has been widely discussed on television (e.g. To date, the discovery has featured prominently in 6 television documentaries including 60 Minutes (USA), Panorama BBC Special Report (UK), Inside Out (BBC TV series) (UK), and CBC The National (Canada). In 2009, Owen launched Cambridge Brain Sciences, a free web-based platform for members of the public and the wider scientific community to assess their cognitive function using scientifically proven tests of memory, attention, reasoning and planning. To date, the tests on the site have been taken more than 12 million times by people worldwide. In April 2010, Owen and his team published the largest ever public test of computer-based brain training in the journal Nature. More than 11,000 adults followed a six-week training regime, completing computer-based tasks on the BBC's website designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention. Details of the results were revealed on BBC1 in Can You Train Your Brain?, a Bang Goes the Theory special and published on the same day in Nature. Book In June 2017, Owen published 'Into The Gray Zone: A Neuroscientist Explores the Border Between Life and Death' a popular science book that told the story of his 20-year quest to show that some patients thought to be in a vegetative state were in fact entirely aware, but incapable of indicating their awareness to the outside world. The book became a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic and received strong positive reviews from publications including Nature, The Guardian, and The New York Times. The book was translated into multiple languages, including Italian, French, Russian, German, Taiwanese, Japanese, Czech and Polish. He was a member of the Neurosciences and Mental Health Committee of the Wellcome Trust in the UK from 2007 to 2012, and of the Gairdner Medical Review Panel in Canada from 2012 to 2017. Owen has also held or holds affiliations with several universities and committees on neuroscience, neuroethics, psychiatry, and philosophy, including the Institute of Psychiatry, Robarts Research Institute, and the International Scientific Committee for the Institute of Cognitive Neurology (INECO).

Stephen Hawking has lived with ALS for the majority of his life. He's pictured delivering a lecture to mark NASA's 50th anniversary in 2008. Its symptoms mimic those of other diseases (such as Parkinson's) and there isn't one test to spot it. British physicist Stephen Hawking has defied the odds, living for more than 45 years with the disease. Hawking was diagnosed at 21, while a graduate student at Cambridge University. When a computer whiz in California heard of Hawking's plight, he sent him a computer program called Equalizer that could speak for him. Since then, Hawking has become known for the synthesized, computer-generated voice that enables him to speak. Determined early on not to let the disease steal his life, Hawking went on to become one of the world's preeminent physicists. He published the best-selling book, \"A Brief History of Time,\" and he has made great contributions to the fields of quantum gravity and cosmology.

In 1846, 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. Constitutionally, it is a politically distinct Region, while within its boundaries both the Flemish and French Communities exercise their authority. Historically, the local language of Brussels was Dutch, and Dutch remained the vernacular language of a majority of inhabitants until around 1950. The city has strong economic ties with surrounding Flanders, and many Dutch-speakers commute to Brussels for work; but, at the same time, the expanding suburbs of Brussels led to a majority of French-speakers in six Flemish villages. Though Belgium as a whole is multilingual, the four language areas into which the country is divided (Flanders, francophone Wallonia, bilingual Brussels and the German-speaking Community) are largely monolingual. Dutch is a monocentric language, at least what concerns its written form, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the Dutch Language Union) based on a Dutch orthography defined in the so-called \"Green Booklet\" authoritative dictionary and \n\n French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking.

After the accession of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to the European Union on 1 May 2004, many Baltic Russians moved to other EU countries. Though initially having bases only in the eastern corner of the Gulf of Finland, the Red Banner Baltic Fleet was the largest naval power in the Baltic Sea. Gains from the peace treaty after the Winter War further helped the Baltic Fleet, as it acquired a base at Hanko, Finland, as well as the coast of the Karelian Isthmus. Liepāja and Tallinn were the main naval bases of the Baltic Fleet prior to Operation Barbarossa. Immediately after the war, a major influx from other USSR republics primarily of ethnic Russians took place in the Baltic states as part of a de facto process of Russification. These new migrants supported the industrialization of Latvia's economy. The influx included the establishment of military bases and associated personnel with the Baltic states now \n\n  There were two major periods during Russia's history when large territories formerly under its rule split away. Active disintegration processes began in the economy, social structure, public and political spheres of the Russian Empire, which ultimately led to the end of the Tsarist regime and became independent states of Poland, Finland and the three Baltic states, while number of other territories obtained limited degree of sovereignty as the union republics (Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). The second was the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990–1991 which led to the independence of its constituent union republics: Moldova, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Some of the aforementioned later became members of the European Union and NATO.

Roosevelt portrayed the war as a crusade against the aggressive dictatorships that threatened peace and democracy throughout the world. He and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan.\n\nQuestion: who was the leader of the us during wwii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After 1870, Monticelli returned to Marseille, where he would live in poverty despite a prolific output, selling his paintings for small sums. The young Paul Cézanne befriended Monticelli in the 1860s, and the influence of the older painter's work can be seen in Cézanne's work of that decade. The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism.

As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (, ; ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Constitution of France provides for the free exercise of religious worship. However, according to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The 1905 law on secularity was highly controversial at the time, but today is held as a founding document of French secularism or laïcité. Some French politicians and communities have more recently questioned the law, arguing that, despite its explicit stance for state secularism, it de facto favors traditional French religions, in particular the Catholic Church, at the expense of more recently established religions, such as Islam.

During the campaign of the 2019 general elections Løkke Rasmussen published an autobiography, in which he opened up for the possibility of forming a government with the Social Democrats. This was seen as controversial in the liberal \"blue bloc\", and Social Democratic leader Mette Frederiksen immediately declined the proposition. Jensen was elected member of Folketinget for the Social Democrats in the 2005 elections. In the government of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Jensen served as Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation from 2013 until 2014. Following the 2019 general election the Social Democrats, led by leader Mette Frederiksen, formed a single-party government with support from the left-wing coalition. Frederiksen became prime minister on 27 June 2019. In the 2019 Danish general election, the Social Democrats gained one further seat and the opposition red bloc of left-wing and centre-left parties (the Social Democrats, the Danish Social Liberal Party, the Socialist People's Party and the Red–Green Alliance along with the Faroese Social Democratic Party and Greenland's Inuit Ataqatigiit and Siumut) won a majority of 93 out of 179 seats in the Folketing while support for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance collapsed, costing Lars Løkke Rasmussen his majority. With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat and Frederiksen has been commissioned by Queen Margrethe II to lead the negotiations to form a new government. Despite having run on an anti-immigration stance during the election, Frederiksen shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.\n\nQuestion: who rules denmark right now?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name Dr. Seuss. Geisel adopted the name \"Dr. Seuss\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog. For example, upon meeting the top hat, the protagonist cries, \"Thunder of Sebastopole! The author's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly: \"Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious, mystifying phrases.\" He illustrated many books penned by Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) under the pen name Theo. Books illustrated by McKie (books he wrote himself are marked with *) include: \n\n And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book published under the pen name Dr. Seuss.

The Trump administration made efforts to repeal the ACA and replace it with a different healthcare policy (known as a \"repeal and replace\" approach), but it never succeeded in doing so through Congress. Next, the administration joined a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ACA, and the Supreme Court agreed at the beginning of March 2020 that it would hear the case.

However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge. In 2009, the U.S. had the highest health care costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, with an estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 16% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) without insurance coverage. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments.

Congressional Republicans made two serious efforts to repeal the ACA. First, in March 2017, Trump endorsed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA. Opposition from several House Republicans, both moderate and conservative, led to the defeat of this version of the bill.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. Eastern tribes such as the Lakotas were pushed across the Mississippi onto the Great Plains in the early 18th century, where they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing tribes in the region. The Iroquois quickly overran Shawnee holdings in central Ohio, forcing them to flee into \n\n Indigenous peoples of North America have created a variety of political organizations. Examples preceding European contact include the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, the Blackfoot Confederacy, and Powhatan Confederacy in three different regions. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the potlatch. In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans.

The Vietnam War began shortly thereafter and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by such communist allies as China and the Soviet Union, and South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist nations. North Vietnam initiated and maintained an insurgent campaign in the South under the National Liberation Front (NLF), otherwise known as the Viet Cong (VC), and provided NLF members with medicine, weapons, \n\n any aid to France that would prop up France's struggle to maintain its pre-WWII colonial empire. As of 2019 it was estimated that approximately 610,000 Vietnam Veterans are still alive, making them the second largest group of Veterans behind those of the Global War on Terror. The war's lasting impact can be seen in the thousands of movies, books, and video games centered on the conflict. By the conclusion of the United States's involvement over 3.1 million Americans had been stationed in Vietnam. At home this involvement played a key role in sparking the Civil Rights Movement, hippie culture and wide ranging changes in popular culture. The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from a combination of factors: Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong's pledge in 1950 to support Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh's guerrilla forces against France's colionial occupation, the U.S. war with Japan in the Pacific, and domestic pressure to act against communism after the loss of mainland China and indecisive conclusion of the Korean War. Early in this period, there was a greater degree of conflict in Laos than in South Vietnam. US combat involvement was, at first, greater in Laos, but the activity of advisors, and increasingly US direct support to South Vietnamese soldiers, increased, under US military authority, in late 1959 and early 1960.\n\nQuestion: where was the vietnam war location?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During his brief administration, he replaced all members except Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon. Ford chose a young Wyoming politician, Richard Cheney, to replace Rumsfeld as his new Chief of Staff; Cheney became the campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign. Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913December 26, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 38th president of the United States from 1974 to 1977. Earlier, he served as the leader of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives, and then as the 40th vice president of the United States from 1973 to 1974. When President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, Ford succeeded to the presidency, but was defeated for election to a full term in 1976. After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented \"co-presidency\", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the vice presidency would be \"a nice conclusion\" to his career. Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president.

Rutherford remained on the university's senate until 1927, when he was elected Chancellor. According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock, it was the honour that Rutherford prized most. In 1904, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a Nobel laureate. In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is not distributed throughout the atom's volume as Thomson believed, but is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center. Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near Ormond, Canada West, on his family's dairy farm. His parents, James (1817&ndash;1891) and Elspet \"Elizabeth\" (1818&ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford, had immigrated from Scotland two years previous. Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a Metcalfe high school. After graduating in 1874, he attended the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist college in Woodstock. He graduated from there in 1876 and taught for a year in Osgoode.\n\nQuestion: what school did sir ernest rutherford go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the year 2021, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine now has the lowest acceptance rate among all dental schools in the United States with an acceptance rate of 2.1%. Tufts Dental Medicine, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University comprise the three schools of dental medicine in the Boston metropolitan area. History\n  \nFounded on June 3, 1868 as Boston Dental College by Dr. Isaac J. Wetherbee, a graduate of the first organized dental university in the United States, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. The college was incorporated into Tufts College in 1899 and was located at 416 Huntington Avenue in Boston. By 1929, Tufts Medical and Dental College began an affiliation with the Boston Floating Hospital for Infants and Children, as well as the Boston Dispensary. This merger resulted in the creation of an association known as the New England Medical Center (NEMC), which would be the name of the hospital attached to the current day Tufts Dental School until the 1990s. The union was partially caused by the fire, and subsequent destruction of the USS Boston Floating Hospital (ID # 2366), a mobile hospital for sick children on Boston Harbor. In 1948, Tufts Medical and Dental College sold the Huntington Avenue buildings to Northeastern University, and relocated closer to NEMC at 136 Harrison Avenue. In 1954, Tufts Dental College became the \"Tufts University School of Dental Medicine\". The school would remain at the Harrison Avenue location until 1971, when it was moved to its current location, 1 Kneeland Street. This was seen by the architectural world as unprecedented; the design and execution has won several architectural awards. While in the past international applicants were considered for admission to the School of Dental Medicine, for the 2012-2013 application cycle those applicants without US citizenship or permanent residency will not be considered for the DMD program. The School has over 7,000 alumni composed of individuals from all fifty states and thirty-nine countries. Facilities\n\nIn 2009, Tufts Dental completed a $68 million, five-floor vertical expansion. Some of the organizations present at Tufts Dental include: Delta Sigma Delta (DSD), American Student Dental Association (ASDA), and the Bates Student Research Group.

In Laos today there are over forty-seven recognized ethnic groups, with the Lao Loum comprising the majority group. As an inland crossroads of Southeast Asia the political history of Laos has been complicated by frequent warfare and colonial conquests by European and regional rivals. As a result, Laos today has cultural influence from France, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia. Laos developed its culture and customs as the inland crossroads of trade and migration in Southeast Asia over millennia. As of 2012 Laos has a population of roughly 6.4 million spread over 236,800 km2 (91,400 sq miles), yielding one of the lowest population densities in Asia. Yet the country of Laos has an official count of over forty-seven ethnicities divided into 149 sub-groups and 80 different languages. In Southeast Asia, traditional Lao culture is considered one of the Indic cultures (along with Burma, Thailand and Cambodia). Laos is geographically isolated and mountainous, bounded by the Annamite Range in the east, forming a traditional political and cultural boundary with Vietnam (a more Chinese influenced Sinitic culture). Diplomacy has concentrated on the Mekong River, seeking to make it a \"river of true peace and friendship\", as made explicit in statements by both respective prime ministers in 1976. Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, bordered by Burma and People's Republic of China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south and Thailand to the west. Laos traces its history to the Kingdom of Lan Xang or Land of a Million Elephants, which existed from the 14th to the 18th century.\n\nQuestion: where is laos in world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This north&ndash;south stretch of the Colorado River forms the border between the U.S. states of California/Arizona and Nevada/Arizona, and between the Mexican states of Baja California/Sonora. It is commonly defined as the region from below Hoover Dam and Lake Mead to its outlet at the northern Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez); it includes the Colorado River proper, canyons, the valley, mountain ranges with wilderness areas, and the floodplain and associated riparian environments. Five Indian reservations are located in the LCRV: the Chemehuevi, Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian Reservations; at Yuma are the Quechan and Cocopah reservations. It is a wide flood basalt plateau between the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains, cut through by the Columbia River. The Colorado Plateau is an area of high desert located in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, bisected by the Colorado River which flows westward through the southern part, and the Green River which flows south from the northernmost part of the plateau. The U.S. State of Colorado includes the headwaters of several important rivers. East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way. West of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow via the Green River, the upper Colorado River (formerly the Grand River), or the San Juan River into the Colorado River and on to the Gulf of California.

The basin spans four countries, however it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the state's territory). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people, the biggest cities within are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.

On 4 July 1908 their next aircraft, the June Bug piloted by Glenn Curtiss, won the Scientific American trophy for the first officially observed one kilometer flight in North America. In 1908 Wilbur Wright finally visited Europe and in August made a series of flight demonstrations which convincingly demonstrated the superiority of their aircraft, particularly its ability to make controlled banked turns, to the European aviation community. The first flight only lasted 1 minute 45 seconds, in which two circles were flown, but the effect was profound, Louis Blériot saying \"I consider that for us in France, and everywhere, a new era in mechanical flight has commenced.

The Seneca inhabited the area well into the 19th century, although many were forced out after the British ceded this territory to the United States following the Revolutionary War. Pioneer Samuel Brownstone conducted violence against the Seneca and other Iroquois peoples in western New York. The Seneca had named the major lake as Ga-ne-a-sos, meaning \"Berry Place\". The town developed between Conesus and Hemlock lakes. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the potlatch. In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples. He became one of the Seneca's most trusted negotiators with the Americans of the new United States. Seneca men were subsistence hunters and fishers. The Seneca were highly skilled at warfare, and were considered fierce adversaries by other Native Americans and European colonists. But the Seneca were also renowned for their sophisticated skills at diplomacy and oratory, and their willingness to unite with the other four of the original Five Nations to \n\n the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations. Today the Seneca Nation sustains its own people. Seneca language, song, art, dance, and sports are all vital expressions of their culture. The number of fluent Seneca language speakers is diminishing due to the deaths of elders, and the language is considered at-risk.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico. The first nation to formally adopt the voseo dialect, Nicaragua is one two Central American nations (Costa Rica is the other) that use voseo Spanish as its written and spoken form of the language. The usage is also seen in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and coastal Colombia. In the Caribbean coast, many Afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language, but they speak a very fluent Spanish as a second language. Many of the indigenous people on the Caribbean coast speak native languages such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language. In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua have maintained their ancestral languages, while also speaking Spanish or English; these include Chinese, Arabic, German, Hawaiian, and Italian. Spanish is taught as the principal language. Spanish became the official language of the chancellery of the Kingdom of Castile. However, in Galicia and neighboring regions of Asturias and León in 1200–1500, the local languages remained the usual written languages in any type of document, either legal or narrative, public or private. It is spoken by some 2.4 million people, mainly in Galicia, an autonomous community located in northwestern Spain, where it is co-official with Spanish.\n\nQuestion: what countries have spanish as the national language?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1838 a French company was given a concession for the construction of a road, rail, or canal route across the isthmus. An initial engineering study recommended a sea-level canal from Limón Bay to the bay of Boca del Monte, 12 mi west of Panama. In March 1854, 700 Chinese laborers arrived to work for the Panama Railroad Company. Decades later, the Panama Canal required years to cut through this area deeply enough for a canal. A second team, working under less harsh conditions with railroad track, ties, railroad cars, steam locomotives, and other supplies brought around Cape Horn by ship, completed its 11 mi of track from Panama City to the summit from the Pacific side of the isthmus at the same time. The project's fortunes turned in November 1851 – just as they were running out of the original $1,000,000 – when two large paddle steamers, the SS Georgia and the SS Philadelphia, with about 1,000 passengers, were forced to shelter in Limón Bay, Panama, owing to a hurricane in the Caribbean. Since the railroad's docks had been completed by this time and rail had been laid 8 mi up to Gatún on the Chagres River, it was possible to unload the ships' cargoes of emigrants and their luggage and transport them\n\nQuestion: what countries does the panama canal go through?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The trajectory of the impressive professional career and turbulent private life that leads to this moment is traced via flashbacks in which Chaplin recalls his introduction to Hollywood and silent movies, his failed marriages and problems with the press, his dealings with the FBI, and the creation of his most beloved character, the iconic Little Tramp. In 1992, \n\n As a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, Chaplin exhibited his paintings at the Paris Salon, the official exhibition venue of members' work.

Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy.

As for religion, although his father attended Puritan services, Revere was drawn to the Church of England.

Revere eventually began attending the services \n\n Revere remained politically active throughout his life. Of particular interest to Revere was the question of protective tariffs; he and his son sent a petition to Congress in 1808 asking for protection for his sheet copper business. Revere died on May 10, 1818, at the age of 83, at his home on Charter Street in Boston. 1770 Revere purchased a house on North Square in Boston's North End. Sarah died in 1773, and on October 10 of that year, Revere married Rachel Walker (1745–1813). They had eight children, three of whom died young.

The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States. The Gorbeiakoa has a soft smooth coat of moderate length, shorter on the face and on the front of the legs, and somewhat longer on the back of them. Dogs stand some at the withers and usually weigh ; bitches are slightly smaller, with weights in the range. The coat of the Iletsua variety is a rougher and wirier than that of the Gorbeiakoa. Dogs stand and weigh, bitches  with weights up to. Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff.

In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in On the Origin of Species in 1859.

Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. He was also profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers' work, Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.

Nikola Tesla first noted around 1891 the ability of high-frequency currents to produce heat in the body and suggested its use in medicine. In 1899 Austrian chemist von Zaynek determined the rate of heat production in tissue as a function of frequency and current density, and first proposed using high-frequency currents for deep heating therapy. In 1908 German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt coined the term diathermy, and performed the first extensive experiments on patients. Until the 1920s noisy spark-discharge Tesla coil and Oudin coil machines were used. These were limited to frequencies of 0.1 – 2 MHz, called \"longwave\" diathermy. See also\nElectrosurgery\n\nReferences\n\nMedical physics\nRadio technology\n\nNikola Tesla faced resistance and eventually became forgotten over time for several reasons. One major reason was his unconventional and visionary ideas that often challenged the established scientific and economic interests of his time. Tesla's inventions and concepts, such as wireless transmission of energy and alternating current (AC), threatened the financial interests of the prominent figures in the electricity industry, such as Thomas Edison. This led to conflicts and competition that worked against Tesla's recognition and acceptance. Furthermore, Tesla's eccentric personality and unconventional lifestyle also contributed to his resistance and subsequent downfall. He was known for his reclusive nature and lack of interest in financial gain, which made it difficult for him to gain support and attract investors. Tesla's focus on his scientific pursuits rather than commercialization hindered his ability to market and promote his inventions effectively. Additionally, Tesla's development of Wardenclyffe Tower, an ambitious project for wireless power transmission, faced financial troubles and was eventually abandoned. This setback was a significant blow to Tesla's reputation and legacy, as it showcased his inability to turn his extraordinary ideas into practical and profitable ventures. Moreover, Tesla's contributions were overshadowed by the success and popularization of other inventors' work, such as Thomas Edison and his direct current (DC) system. Edison engaged in a bitter rivalry with Tesla, which influenced public opinion and further marginalized Tesla's achievements. Over time, the lack of recognition, financial struggles, and overshadowing by competing inventors led to Tesla's fading from the public eye. It was not until much later that his contributions to the field of electricity and technology were rediscovered and re-evaluated, leading to a renewed interest in his work and the recognition he deserved. balls and painted metal disks on the display table and even small disks inside vacuum bulbs placed at some distance around the Electricity Building.

Michael Faraday described in 1831 with his law of induction the electromotive force driving a current in a conductor loop by a time-varying magnetic flux. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell's equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the \"wireless\" carrier of electromagnetic energy. History\nThe idea that high-frequency electromagnetic currents could have therapeutic effects was explored independently around the same time (1890–91) by French physician and biophysicist Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval and Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla. d'Arsonval had been studying medical applications for electricity in the 1880s and performed the first systematic studies in 1890 of the effect of alternating current on the body, and discovered that frequencies above 10 kHz did not cause the physiological reaction of electric shock, but warming. Nikola Tesla first noted around 1891 the ability of high-frequency currents to produce heat in the body and suggested its use in medicine.

The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the Volksunie (People's Union) which split into different parties including the Vlaams Blok (succeeded by the Vlaams Belang), the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and FlemishProgressives. Ghent which, though situated in largely Dutch-speaking Flanders, taught exclusively in French. In 1915, the Governor General decided to launch the Flamenpolitik (Flemish Policy) to use the animosity between the two language groups to facilitate the administration of the territory and to portray the occupation regime as the liberation of Flanders. The policy was especially advocated by pan-Germanists, like the Alldeutscher Verband, who believed that the Flemish shared racial traits with the Germans that the Walloons did not. The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking bourgeoisie who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the Flemish movement, which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the Flemish people. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921.

These attempts came to nothing significant until the 1960s when the need for a currency more suited to simple monetary calculations became pressing. The decision to decimalise was announced in 1966, with the pound to be redivided into 100, rather than 240, pence. Decimal Day was set for 15 February 1971, and a whole range of new coins was introduced.

Obama lost the overall White vote, although he won a larger proportion of White votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter. He dropped-out of the school, returning home and enrolling himself at Thornton Community College, while working part time as an auxiliary clerk at the American Medical Association. He graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at University of Chicago Law School, he attended classes taught by then-professors Barack Obama and Elena Kagan. The course he took that was taught by Obama was a seminar course on racism and law. He graduated from with his juris doctorate in 1995. After graduating from Williamsville High School (now Williamsville South High School), Abercrombie pursued studies in sociology at Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1959. At the university he befriended and attended classes with President Barack Obama's parents, Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr. To support himself as a graduate student, Abercrombie worked as a waiter at Chuck's Steak House in Waikīkī, locker desk clerk at the Central YMCA, custodian at Mother Rice Preschool, construction apprentice program director, elementary school teacher, and a college lecturer.

In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and one of the official languages of Singapore. Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. Continuing previous policies, the People’s Republic of China sought to further standardize a common language, now dubbed Putonghua (\"Common Speech\"), for national and political unity. In aims of reducing the country’s approximately 80% illiteracy rate, the \"Decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and State Council Concerning Elimination of Illiteracy\" of March 1956 solidified the Communist Party’s plans to reform the country's traditional characters to a simplified writing system. Since 1955, Chinese and Indian students attend classes dedicated to the learning of their culture and ancestral language so that they learn a third language in addition to the two other languages mentioned above. (Cantonese is also pretty useful in international trade.) However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (regional speech). Cantonese is still the most commonly-used language in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Hokkien has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language alongside Mandarin.\n\nQuestion: what is the primary language of china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As part of this same campaign the armies of Saladin conquered, expelled, enslaved, or killed the remaining Christian communities of Galilee, Samaria, Judea, as well as the coastal towns of Ashkelon, Jaffa, Caesarea, and Acre. This rendered Jerusalem defenseless and dealt a heavy blow to the city's status.

Aristotle introduced what may be called a scientific method. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that \n\n poet Dante called him “the master of those who know\".

Francisco Reyes, alcalde or mayor of Los Angeles from 1793–1795, had set up a grazing operation which he called Rancho Encino located in what is now Mission Hills near the village of Pasakngna. Reyes's property had a substantial water supply from artesian wells and limestone for building, and was situated a day's walk from the existing missions San Gabriel and San Buenaventura. In 1846, the Mexican government confiscated the missions and secularized the properties. Pio Pico became the owner of the Mission San Fernando, selling it in 1846 to Elogio de Chelis. When John C. Fremont led an American military force into California in 1847, he occupied the Convento and used it as a base of operations.\n\nQuestion: where was mission san rafael located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Esther asks that the entire Jewish community fast and pray for \n\n  As described in the Book of Esther, Haman was the son of Hammedatha the Agagite. Angered by this, and knowing of Mordechai's Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the Jews in the Persian empire killed. The plot was foiled by Queen Esther, the king's recent wife, who was herself a Jew. Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. Among these women is a Jewish orphan named Esther, who was raised by her cousin or uncle, Mordecai (2:5–7). Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, Bigthan and Teresh, to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is recorded (2:21–23). Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him (3:2–5).\n\nQuestion: who was esther's husband?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The center of the community was St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which is the second-oldest congregation of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod in the Pacific Northwest. St. Paul is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. It is named after the Saint Paul Mission founded by Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet, who arrived in the Oregon Country in 1838 to minister to the Catholic inhabitants of French Prairie. Foster is located on Virginia Route 14 3.5 mi west-northwest of Mathews. St. Paul's Episcopal Church is an historic Episcopal church in Richmond, Virginia, United States. Located directly across the street from the Virginia State Capitol, it has long been a popular house of worship for political figures, including General Robert E. Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis (earning it the nickname \"the Cathedral of the Confederacy\"). St. Paul's was built in 1845 as a branch of the Monumental Church, which had outgrown its building. St. Paul United Methodist Church is located in the historic Grant Park neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. For a time in the early 1900s, St. Paul had the largest Methodist congregation in the Southeastern United States. St. Paul is a main stop on tours of the Grant Park neighborhood given by the Atlanta Preservation Center. St. Paul is also home to the Grant Park Cooperative Preschool. St. Paul, the Grant Park Cooperative Preschool and the Grant Park Parent Network host the annual Grant Park Candlelight Tour of Homes, which also includes an artist marketplace and a Winter Wonderland for children.

Citrus fruit, especially oranges, are a major part of the economy, and Florida produces the majority of citrus fruit grown in the United States. In 2006, 67% of all citrus, 74% of oranges, 58% of tangerines, and 54% of grapefruit were grown in Florida. About 95% of commercial orange production in the state is destined for processing (mostly as orange juice, the official state beverage). Citrus canker continues to be an issue of concern. From 1997 to 2013, the growing of citrus trees has declined 25%, from 600000 to 450000 acres. In August 2005, citrus greening disease was discovered in the south Florida region around Homestead and Florida City. The disease has since spread to every commercial citrus grove in Florida. In 2004–2005, USDA statistics reported the total Florida citrus production to be 169.1 million boxes of fruit. The estimate for all Florida citrus production in the 2015–2016 season is 94.2 million boxes, a 44.3% drop. Cotton has long been a primary exported cash crop, but it is no longer vital as an export. Production in 1999 was 243,000 tons. Citrus, dates, and grapes are the main fruits by \n\n Brazil in 2005 produced around 8.7 million tonnes of beef, becoming world export leader in 2003 after surpassing Australia.

Held usually at the end of January every year, the 42.195 km race starts from Nagai Stadium, runs through Nakanoshima, Midōsuji and Osaka castle park, and returns to the stadium. Another yearly event held at Nagai Stadium is the Osaka Gran Prix \n\n Osaka hosts four professional sport teams: one of them is the Orix Buffaloes, a Nippon Professional Baseball team, playing its home games at Kyocera Dome Osaka. Another baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers, although based in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo, plays a part of its home games in Kyocera Dome Osaka as well, when their homeground Koshien Stadium is occupied with the annual National High School Baseball Championship games during summer season. There are two J.League clubs, Gamba Osaka, plays its home games at Suita City Football Stadium. Another club Cerezo Osaka, plays its home games at Yanmar Stadium Nagai. The city is home to Osaka Evessa, a basketball team that plays in the B.League. Association football became popular in Japan through Captain Tsubasa, with members of the Japan national football team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup citing the series as among their influences. The Olympic Museum scheduled an exhibition on sports manga \n\n Sports in Japan are a significant part of Japanese culture. Both traditional sports such as sumo and martial arts, and Western imports like basketball and association football, are popular with both participants and spectators. The Nippon Professional Baseball league has been Japan's largest professional sports competition in terms of television ratings and spectators. Association football has gained wide popularity since the founding of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992.

Though a majority of the Russian Federation's land area is located within Asia, it is generally considered a European country because of its historical, cultural, ethnic, and political ties to Europe. Despite the financial crisis, international aid to Russia was not considered likely. Russian counter-sanctions however reduced imports of food into Russia, which led to rising inflation and an increase in food prices. Azerbaijan has international land borders with 5 states. The neighboring countries are Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Iran to the south, Turkey to the west (via the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the northwest) and Armenia to the west and via the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the north and east.

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. After reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Dee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy According to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.

All homœopathic physicians learn a great deal about suppression in the course of long practice ; they cannot help it, if they would, in this day of great wear and tear, hurry and worry, strong drugging, injection treatment. When the effects show viciously in little children the spectacle is truly pathetic, even tragic. This case was reported once to the I. H. A. On my return two days later the frantic mother begged me to do something the patient was desperately ill, was given oxygen all the time and had had a blood transfusion that morning. I called up the doctor, staling my position as family physician and asking what he thought of her, hoping he would offer to withdraw, he did not do so. The doctor did not communicate with me ; I never saw him ; he had made no comment to the parents, so probably he thinks his treatment triumphed in spite of mine. Late one evening this spring a frantic call came from a father who had heard of the last case. I found this tiny mite of humanity lying quite limp, eyes closed, lips parted, blue all over, skin rather cool, respiration gasping for five or six breaths then no respiration for 3/4 minute, then five or six more gasps and the same intervals ; pulse very thready during the attempts at respiration's and gone in the interval between ; ability to swallow gone. I did not wonder that the doctor in charge had felt hopeless. Then she suddenly dropped back to the first state. The hospital people would not co-operate at all, so she was taken home ; almost died on arrival but revived with oxygen and Kali-bi. set this right within a few hours. This was suppressed over and over during the first two years of life by a skin specialist who bound up the head with salves and ointments. He was then\n\nMay be of interest: Heilkunst and Autism (and other Behavioral Disorders). Because they were very concerned about the negative effects of the medical intervention their son had already undergone, including drugs and vaccinations, they specifically requested that he be treated for these using a sequential causal approach to removing the traumas. His improvement in the first year (indeed, the first few months) was already so significant that I thought it would be a good case to demonstrate how positive change can occur in a short period of time in a serious situation. Sam’s (not his real name) chief complaint was recurrent viral infections. He had chronic gastroesophageal reflux, which was worse in Spring, and severe asthma with strider. The physicians advised that he would outgrow it, so they didn’t treat it at that time. He had used an epinephrine pen at that time because soon after his vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) at 18 months he developed breathing difficulties with “strider,” a high-pitched crowing sound of his airway closing off when trying to breathe. The strider began with a head cold. He had several more episodes with strider. His mother was by now totally disillusioned with the allopathic merry-go-round in which she seemed to have become caught up, and she was distressed that things had gone so badly for so long. She said she knew, as a registered nurse, that her son wasn’t improving and at best was being palliated. Sam could only eat pureed food and liquids, because of the severe reflux. His mother had been diagnosed with mononucleosis and was just recovering from that when she conceived.

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. After reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Dee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy According to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did.\n\nQuestion: what did drita find out?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The modern usage of the term Vulgar Latin dates to the Renaissance, when Italian thinkers began to theorize that their own language originated in a sort of \"corrupted\" Latin that they assumed formed an entity distinct from the literary Classical variety, though opinions differed greatly on the nature of this \"vulgar\" dialect. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from Latinus. Latinus was worshiped on Mons Albanus (Monte Albano) during an annual festival attended by all Latins, including those from Rome, one of the Latin states. Consequently, some of the Latin states were incorporated within the Roman state, and their inhabitants were given full Roman citizenship. Vulgar Latin (in Latin, sermo vulgaris) is a blanket term covering vernacular dialects of the Latin language spoken from earliest times in Italy until the latest dialects of the Western Roman Empire, diverging still further, evolved into the early Romance languages—whose writings began to appear about the 9th century. It is likely to have evolved over time, with some features not appearing until the late Empire. Because there are few phonetic transcriptions of the daily speech of these Latin speakers (to match, \n\n  Latin is a member of the broad family of Italic languages. Historical Latin came from the prehistoric language of the Latium region, specifically around the River Tiber, where Roman civilization first developed. How and when Latin came to be spoken by the Romans are questions that have long been debated. Various influences on Latin of Celtic dialects in northern Italy, the non-Indo-European Etruscan language in Central Italy, and the Greek in some Greek colonies of southern Italy have been detected, but when these influences entered the native Latin is not known for certain.

This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala. For example, if it is 23 years after the beginning of the Dreamspell, month 1, day 2, the date is \"NS1.23.1.2\" This system, as mentioned above, is similar to the dating system of the \"Mayan calendar\" cycle which \"ends\" on December 21, 2012.

One significant event is the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. This event holds a powerful place in global memories as one of the most devastating acts in history. Additionally, Hiroshima is interconnected with the attack on Pearl Harbor, which triggered the United States' entry into World War II. These interconnected events contribute to a broader memory complex associated with Hiroshima. The use of atomic bombs during World War II marked the beginning of the nuclear age, which intensified the tensions and fears of the Cold War era. The threat of nuclear warfare and the lasting impacts of the bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are part of the collective memory surrounding the atomic age and the Cold War.

By examining and analyzing these interconnected events and memories, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of the significance and impact of Hiroshima in the collective memory of humanity. World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.

During the time of Linnaeus, there was an increasing amount of information on previously unknown plant and animal species, leading to a concept known as 'information overload.' In order to effectively organize and handle this wealth of information, Linnaeus created taxonomic systems, rules of nomenclature, and technical terminologies. By creating a standardized system for classifying and naming plants, Linnaeus provided botanists with a common language and framework for studying and categorizing different species. Additionally, Linnaeus's taxonomic system allowed for the comparison and classification of plants based on their shared characteristics and relationships. By organizing plants into clusters and hierarchies, Linnaeus enabled researchers to identify patterns and similarities among different species, which opened up new avenues for studying their biological and ecological features. Furthermore, Linnaeus's development of technical terminologies provided researchers with specific vocabulary and descriptive terms to accurately communicate and document their observations. His innovations provided a structured and organized approach to classifying and naming plants, allowing for a more systematic and comprehensive study of the natural world. Ultimately, Linnaeus's work laid the foundation for the emergence of the 'natural' system, which continues to be a fundamental aspect of botanical research today. Where Linnaeus had conceived ranks, which were consistent with the great chain of being adopted by the rationalists, Darwin conceived lineages. Charles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Maintenance of this system involves formal rules of nomenclature \n\n Carl Linnaeus ( 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné, was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, taxonomist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linnæus (after 1761 Carolus a Linné). Linnaeus was born in Råshult, the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730.\n\nQuestion: who was carolus linnaeus?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The relationship of CDU to the CSU has historic parallels to previous Christian-democratic parties in Germany, with the Catholic Centre Party having served as a national Catholic party throughout the German Empire and the Weimar Republic while the Bavarian People's Party functioning as the Bavarian variant. The CSU and the state of Bavaria decided not to sign the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany as they insisted on more autonomy for the individual states.

She pursued an undergraduate degree in political science and economics at Swarthmore College, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1995. She then chose to pursue a Master of Public Health degree at Yale University between 1996 and 1998. She followed that interest in health security to Princeton University Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where she pursued a doctorate degree from 2000 to 2005 at the intersection of public health and national security. There, she was given access to documentation on an agent of Soviet-backed toxin warfare known as \"yellow rain\", which ultimately became the subject of her doctoral dissertation carried out under the mentorship of Burton Singer. Her thesis, entitled Yellow rain revisited: Lessons learned for the investigation of chemical and biological weapons allegations evaluated yellow rain as a case study in chemical and biological weapons allegations, as well as for evaluating the protocols used to mitigate proliferation of such warfare. She specialized in issues related to the Biological Weapons Convention, a disarmament treaty signed 1975 to ban biological warfare.

REPORT ON DAY CONFERENCE ALVERTON HOTEL, TRURO OCTOBER 18 2012. The keynote speaker, Dr William Walsh, showed no signs of jet lag after his long trip across the Atlantic. A formidable world expert in nutritional medicine – and founder/president of the non-profit Walsh Research Institute based in Illinois – Dr Walsh gave three presentations covering nutritional practice and research in the treatment of Schizophrenia and Depression; Behaviour and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders; and the growing field of Epigenetics. All of the available copies for sale at the conference were snapped up. Other speakers included psychologist, David Kennard, who covered the history of therapeutic communities and Brendan Hickey, manager of the Lothlorien Therapeutic community since 1992. Both gave insights into a more holistic approach to mental health – the inspiration behind Chy Sawel’s aim to get a therapeutic mental health centre set up in Cornwall.

Afrikaans (,, English meaning: African) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia, and, to a lesser extent, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the European (Dutch, French, and German) settlers and their slaves in South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Although Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages, including German and the Khoisan languages, an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin. Therefore, differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic-type morphology and grammar of Afrikaans and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans \n\n Dutch (Nederlands ) is a West Germanic language spoken by about 25 million people as a first language and 5 million people as a second language, constituting most of the population of the Netherlands (where it is the only official language countrywide) and about 60% of the population of Belgium (as one of three official languages).

Your tour operator ought to provide guidelines and information on what you will need though, to balance sensible caution with realistic risk. It is wise, however, to be up-to-date with tetanus, polio, diphtheria, typhoid and hepatitis A.\nYellow fever vaccination is likely to be recommended if you are travelling to areas east of the Andes, and occasionally for longer-term travellers to the west coast. Malarone (proguanil and atovaquone) is recommended for short trips as, although it’s expensive, it is effective and has fewer side effects. Chloroquine may be recommended for trips to the jungle around Puerto Maldonado and this is a weekly tablet, which is easy to take and very cheap. Visit a travel clinic for upto- date advice about the most suitable option. In general though, Peru is very safe. If you are in a tour group the chances of serious crime are small. Peru abides by all the usual drug laws so don’t dabble. However, coca leaf is grown and used legally for medicinal and cultural purposes; you may find that you can’t bring it back to your home country though. Women travelling alone in Peru ought to have fewer gender-related issues compared with visiting some parts of the world. On an organised tour, guides and facilities staff should be highly professional. At the risk of stating the obvious, single women travellers might want to be especially circumspect when choosing what to wear; in the highlands and traditional communities clothing is quite conservative. Peru isn’t especially accommodating of travellers with disabilities. What’s more, increasingly large numbers of tour operators are conscious of meeting the needs of less-mobile or otherwise less-able travellers. When planning your trip make sure to enquire of your tour operator which facilities accommodate disabled travellers. Visa issued at a consulate and a passport valid for six months Restricted visa approved by the Commission for Restricted Visas and a passport valid for six months Holders of passports of the following jurisdictions require a visa to visit Costa Rica:  \n\n Costa Rican passports are issued to Costa Rican citizens to travel outside Costa Rica. It is issued to people born on Costa Rican soil (who are citizens by default), and to children of Costa Rican citizens born abroad, who are reported to the nearest Costa Rican embassy (whose birth, immediately after such report, is recorded in the civil registry). Children born overseas to a Costa Rican citizen are Costa Rican by birth, not by naturalisation, as stated in the Constitution of Costa Rica. As of 1 October 2019, Costa Rican citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 150 countries and territories, ranking the Costa Rican passport 27th overall and first among Central American countries, in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index. In 2017, the Costa Rican government confirmed plans to begin issuing biometric passports by 2020. Peru has become a popular destination for many travelers of all ages. Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Sunscreen/repellant: Peruvian sun, especially at altitude, is intense and sunscreen can be expensive in some touristy destinations. Repellant is also great for Manchu Picchu, although other highland areas do not have many biting insects. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. Although it is not something many of us like to dwell on before traveling, having insurance is a good safe guard against much hardship if an emergency does unfortunately occur. PassportAll travelers are required to have a valid passport (http: //travel.state.gov/passport). If you do not have a passport, get one quickly. Check the expiration date to make sure your passport is valid at least 6 months beyond your return date to the US and that there are blank pages available for entry/departure stamps. Be sure to have your passport with you during travel to and from Peru, although a Visa is not necessary. Make sure you notify your bank of travels before you leave, and make a copy of all your cards to store with your passport copy while traveling. Bring an extra ATM card! I’ve had an ATM eat my card more than once while traveling, and in many small shops/towns, credit cards are a bit harder to use and will be harder to use as a primary means of currency.Also, it is a good idea to leave copies of such important documents with someone you trust at home in case of emergency. Leave a rough itinerary with someone you trust at home, and keep in touch with them throughout your trip. Getting to Cusco can be difficult, and most travelers will first arrive in Lima, Peru in route to Cusco. Due to flight schedules, it is likely you may spend a night, or at least several hours in this airport. Some people chose to sleep waiting for their connection, but you are not allowed thru the security line until much closer to your flight time, so if you are solo, take care to be aware of your surroundings and keep your luggage close by. Anyone, traveling or not, has full access to this area of the airport. Many travel agents will be overly friendly offering tours and hotels upon arrival, sometimes rather aggressively. Although I cannot say much for the deals they offer, know that it is extremely easy, and probably more relaxing and cheaper, to find tourists offices all around Cusco and in most tourists towns throughout Peru. Collect your luggage and head into the parking lot to escape. There, taxis will be waiting. If you do not know where you are staying for the first night, the Plaza del Arms is the center of Cusco’s touristy area and an easy place to find a coffee shop with tourist’s maps that will mark several hostels and restaurants to help get you oriented for your first night. High Altitude:If you choose to fly into Cusco from Lima, the first thing most travelers will notice is the effect of the high altitude. Cusco is situated at 11,151 feet above sea level. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival).Medication Options: Diamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness, Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival). Coca tea or leaves: It is said that the drink helps reduce symptoms of high altitude illness. Be extremely careful when eating at buffet type restaurants.\n\nQuestion: what kind of money should i take to costa rica?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Plays \n\n  Shakespeare's influence extends from theater and literatures to present-day movies, Western philosophy, and the English language itself. William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare's writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world’s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. His plays exhibited \"spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with a mingling of comedy with tragedy\".

This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended. Rabbinic Judaism was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. Orthodox Judaism regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the Early Christians and the Pharisees survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.

Howard's 1933 film The Power \n\n Columbia Pictures adapted the novel to film, with a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman, and Academy Award winner Ron Howard directing. Roger Ebert in its review wrote that \"Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones... it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.\" Ron Howard returned to direct both sequels. The film was released in 2008 and directed by Ron Howard. It was also nominated for five Academy Awards, again winning none: Best Picture, Best Actor (Langella), Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American filmmaker, actor and composer. Although Carpenter has worked with various film genres, he is associated most commonly with horror, action, and science fiction films of the 1970s and 1980s. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the French Directors' Guild presented Carpenter with the Golden Coach Award, lauding him as \"a creative genius of raw, fantastic, and spectacular emotions.\" Most films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984).

The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems (the Greek and Aramaic scripts), the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script and possibly Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic). The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III), with the first decipherable sentence \n\n The Egyptian language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. By the Early Dynastic Period in the late 4th millennium BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their cursive form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. The Egyptians called their hieroglyphs \"words of god\" and reserved their use for exalted purposes, such as communicating with divinities and spirits \n\n of the New Kingdom.

During his time as a Senator, he had an affair with Gunilla von Post, who later wrote that the future President tried to end his marriage to be with her before having any children with his wife. Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with women such as Marilyn Monroe, Judith Campbell, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Marlene Dietrich, Mimi Alford, and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure. The extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in \n\n correspondent from The Washington Post, Truitt confirmed the Enquirer's account, stated that Meyer had told him of the affair, and that he had kept notes about what he had been told.

Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. PassportAll travelers are required to have a valid passport (http: //travel.state.gov/passport). If you do not have a passport, get one quickly. Check the expiration date to make sure your passport is valid at least 6 months beyond your return date to the US and that there are blank pages available for entry/departure stamps. Be sure to have your passport with you during travel to and from Peru, although a Visa is not necessary. Extra copies of your passport should be made prior to leaving and stored either electronically, and/or in an area separate from where your actual passport will be stored while traveling. MoneyCredit cards and ATM cards are also good to have access to funds while traveling. Make sure you notify your bank of travels before you leave, and make a copy of all your cards to store with your passport copy while traveling. Also, include any international numbers for the appropriate banks with this documentation in case of theft or loss of a card. Bring an extra ATM card! I’ve had an ATM eat my card more than once while traveling, and in many small shops/towns, credit cards are a bit harder to use and will be harder to use as a primary means of currency.Also, it is a good idea to leave copies of such important documents with someone you trust at home in case of emergency. Leave a rough itinerary with someone you trust at home, and keep in touch with them throughout your trip. in case someone needs to help you reach home in an emergency abroad. Put this information in your day bag and an extra in your main pack at the start of the trip, that way it will be there if you need it. Getting to Cusco can be difficult, and most travelers will first arrive in Lima, Peru in route to Cusco. Due to flight schedules, it is likely you may spend a night, or at least several hours in this airport. Some people chose to sleep waiting for their connection, but you are not allowed thru the security line until much closer to your flight time, so if you are solo, take care to be aware of your surroundings and keep your luggage close by. Anyone, traveling or not, has full access to this area of the airport. Many travel agents will be overly friendly offering tours and hotels upon arrival, sometimes rather aggressively. Although I cannot say much for the deals they offer, know that it is extremely easy, and probably more relaxing and cheaper, to find tourists offices all around Cusco and in most tourists towns throughout Peru. Collect your luggage and head into the parking lot to escape. There, taxis will be waiting. If you do not know where you are staying for the first night, the Plaza del Arms is the center of Cusco’s touristy area and an easy place to find a coffee shop with tourist’s maps that will mark several hostels and restaurants to help get you oriented for your first night. High Altitude:If you choose to fly into Cusco from Lima, the first thing most travelers will notice is the effect of the high altitude. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival).Medication Options: Diamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness, Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival). In plane terms, it can help you regain your appetite and reduce any sinus pressure you may feel upon arrival. Be extremely careful when eating at buffet type restaurants. Do not eat raw seafood such as ceviche.Medications: Ciproflaxacin 500mg (#14) In case of acute gastroenteritis (fever, vomiting and diarrhea), you may want to\n\n Dowry is a traditional and current practice in Morocco, and is called shura, shawar, ssdaq or amerwas depending on the speaker's region and ethnicity (e.g. Dowry in Morocco is separate from the Mahr or Sadaq that is religiously required by Sharia.

Spain, for example, has territories south of the Mediterranean Sea namely Ceuta and Melilla which are parts of Africa, and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents. Both Spain and France retain possession of a number of territories in Africa in the form of islands in the Mediterranean Sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the case of Spain, and in the Indian Ocean in the case of France. The Canary Islands, as well as Ceuta and Melilla and the Plazas de soberania islands in the Mediterranean Sea off the northern coast of Morocco, have long been in Spanish possession since the Reconquista, although Morocco continues to challenge Spain's authority over some of the islands. Bordered by Morocco, it lies along the boundary between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

To further rebalance power in the IMF, China appealed for changes that would transfer voting power to developing economies. In 2010, the Chinese executive director of the Fund, Zhou Xiaochuan, addressed the board and asserted that giving more power to the emerging economies was critical for the group's legitimacy, accountability and long-term health. China cooperated with other developing countries to advance its rebalancing project. China cooperated with the BRICS, a coalition of the nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. With a larger combined voting share and voice, the BRICS has been more effective at renegotiating IMF governance. agreements with developed countries (such as the United States and the European Union) would probably be beneficial to Brazil's long-term economic self-interest, the Brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within Mercosul and expanded trade ties with countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In recent years, it has given high priority in establishing political dialogue with other strategic actors such as India, Russia, China and South Africa through participation in international groupings such as BASIC, IBSA and BRICS. The BRICS states have been amongst the most powerful drivers of incremental change in world diplomacy and they benefit most from the connected global power shifts.

In his junior year (the freshman year for Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Jay Vincent) under coach Jud Heathcote, the Spartans squad had an impressive season, racking up a 25–5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA tournament, where they made it to the regional finals before losing narrowly to eventual champion Kentucky. As a senior, he along with Johnson led the Spartans to the 1979 NCAA tournament championship, the first in the school's history. He was often on the receiving end of spectacular alley-oop passes from Johnson. He later wrote a book about his basketball experiences at MSU. He was the very first Big-10 player, and remains the only player in Spartan basketball history, to score over 2,000 points with over 1,000 rebounds. He played in college for Oregon State University and was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1964 NBA draft. Halfway through that season he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, who made it to the playoffs that year.

Locke's Two Treatises of Government published in 1689 was especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the \"consent of the governed\". Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The theory of the social contract influenced the belief among many of the Founders that the right of the people to overthrow their leaders was one of the \"natural rights\" of man, should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen. The Americans heavily relied on Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the \"balanced\" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions. While these concepts have evolved, much of the basic theories which he outlined still have relevance in modern political analysis. His writings affected political developments in the United States. In his Elements on Political Economy, he represents himself as a protectionist.

The subsequent diplomatic issues that have arisen, usually is the refugee flows and border transgressions by Indonesian forces.

Borneo and the other Indonesian islands west of Sulawesi are part of Sundaland, and were connected to the Asian continent when sea levels were lower during the ice ages. The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania.

Spanning 473481 km2, Sumatra is home to human civilisations and tropical rainforests, which harbour a huge range of wildlife. For instance, the Insular Riau region is situated along the central coast of Sumatra, and thus has a strong relationship with fishing, seafare and marine operations. This has characterised the transportation and trading aspects of the region; central regions of Sumatra rely on this region to transport ocean foods and marine related goods, while Insular Riau is dependant on the central regions of Sumatra for import of foods and other goods. considered to be a country in Asia. The division between Asia and Australasia (Oceania) is disputed and placed somewhere between Java and New Guinea. Indonesia spans both areas, but is considered to be in Asia. East Timor is sometimes considered to be part of Australasia, but due to its being surrounded by Indonesia, and its once being part of Indonesia, it is generally considered to be in Asia.

Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings. Furthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. In addition to his artistic and scientific contributions, da Vinci's anatomical drawings also highlight his multidisciplinary approach as a true \"uomo universale\" or \"universal man.\" Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist. By virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form.

More than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached Kilwa, the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim. A meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by the Ottoman Empire, and rivalry with the Italian states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to India. The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco da Gama in 1498, when after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope he arrived in Calicut, now in Kerala. Vasco da Gama's first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the Zamorin of Calicut.

By constitutional powers, the President promulgates \n\n The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law takes precedent over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. After the American Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Constitution's Bill of Rights to state governments. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. From early in the Constitutional Convention, Madison held the position that the national government should be federal because if it were more extensive in relation to the states, that would increase the \"probability of duration, happiness and good order\". It was not initially clear how the new government would interact with the states, and Madison was in favor of a federal form, \"a political system in which at least two territorial levels of government share sovereign constitutional authority over their respective division and joint share of law-making powers; differently put, neither the federal government nor the relevant federative entities may unilaterally alter one another's powers without a process of constitutional amendment in which both levels of government participate.\" of state policy. The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us constitution set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. Now 84, Matisse died on 3 November 1954. The day before, when she came to his sickbed, Matisse made a last drawing – it was of her, using a ball-point pen. an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the US. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Shortly after being released from prison, Mouly, along with fellow artist Édouard Pignon, rented the Boulogne studio of famed modernist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz (1891–1973). In 1945, his paintings were exhibited alongside the paintings of Matisse in the Salon d'Automne in Paris. Mouly's first one-person exhibition was held in 1949 at the Libraire Bergamasque. Mouly's style was influenced by the deep, bold colors typically used in Matisse's fauvist works, and by the cubism of Picasso.\n\nQuestion: what type of artist is henri matisse?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. 1.34 billion spoke some variety of Mandarin Chinese as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country's population. According to the 2019 edition of Ethnologue, 904,000,000 people in China spoke some variety of Mandarin as their first language in 2017. Standard Chinese, known in China as Putonghua, based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing, is the official national spoken language for the mainland and serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking regions (and, to a lesser extent, across the other regions of mainland China). For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region and Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia. Language laws of China do not apply to either Hong Kong or Macau, which have different official languages (Cantonese, English and Portuguese) from the mainland. The result in Mandarin, for example, has been the proliferation of the number of two-syllable compound words, which have steadily replaced former monosyllabic words; most words in Standard Mandarin now have two syllables. Note: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (regional speech).\n\nQuestion: what language do chinese people write in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The assassination of United States president William McKinley took place at 4:07 p.m. on Friday, September 6, 1901, at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York. McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to gangrene setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901, at 2:15 a.m. Members\n\nQuestion: when did william mckinley died?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Syrian American Jews celebrate the Jewish holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Purim, Passover and Shavuot. Muslim Syrian Americans celebrate three main Muslim holidays: Ramadan, Eid ul-Fitr (Lesser Bairam), and Eid ul-Adha (Greater Bairam). Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic year, during which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset; Muslims resort to self-discipline to cleanse themselves spiritually. Muslims also celebrate Eid ul-Adha (which means The Festival of Sacrifice) 70 days after at the end of the Islamic year, a holiday which is held along with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Hajj. This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. Breaking the daily sunrise-to-sunset fast is a banquet with family and friends whereas public banquets are held by charities and other associations. Many Muslims, following Muhammad's reported example, break their fast with a date followed by a variety of dishes. The other major Muslim feast is the four-day Eid al-Adha, the Feast of the Sacrifice, which occurs during Dhu al-Hijjah (the pilgrimage month). Eid Al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan (a month of fasting), and Muslims usually give zakat (charity) on the occasion. Eid Al-Adha is celebrated at the end of Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca), which is one of the five pillars, and Muslims usually sacrifice an animal and distribute its meat among family, friends and the poor.

Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century.

He was fascinated by the Code of Hammurabi and pursued the subject avidly, even after leaving Iraq. Between 1952 and 1955, he wrote a series of six detailed articles in Urdu on Hammurabi, his laws, Babylonian civilisation, traditions, customs and language. The six articles were subsequently revised, expanded and published as a book and in 2000, a new edition was published in Lahore entitled \"Hammurabi aur Babli Tahzib va Tamaddum\". Malik Ram maintained that Hammurabi is one of the all-time great figures in world history, who should be given more attention, time and space in the modern world, in educational institutions and by the media. 729 BC—Tiglath-Pileser III officially crowned sovereign of Asia in Babylon. ; 724 BC—Ahaz, king of Judah (740 BC–726 BC) dies. ; 722 BC—Shalmaneser V, king of Assyria, dies. ; 721 BC—Shabaka succeeds his father Piye as king of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. ; 720 BC—Shabaka kills Bakenranef (Bocchoris), ending the Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt ; 720 BC—Death of King Ping of the Zhou Dynasty of China.

In 1840, contrary to the wishes of his family, he entered \n\n boarding school, where he was mistreated.

The doctors explained she contracted hepatitis through the blood transfusion just given to save her life. Smith had hepatitis C. At that time, medical officials had not discovered hepatitis C. They would not have a blood test to screen for the virus until the following decade. An estimated 70 percent of those carrying the liver-destroying virus don’t know they have it. And Smith is no exception. Twenty-five years since she was infected, and after waiting more than a decade on transplant waiting lists, Smith has been accepted by Oregon Health and Science University in Portland to receive a new liver. Her liver is ravaged, has cancerous tumors and does not function. Smith’s experience differs from many of the 90,264 transplant candidates on the waiting list. She said that each time she is ill enough to get a transplant, her health improves and she goes to the bottom of the list. There is no known medical explanation for her health improvements. Smith said she initially became bitter when doctors told her she had few months to live. Unlike many with liver failure, Smith’s skin and eyes have not yellowed. Her situation exemplifies how humor, motivation and spirituality can help beat the odds for terminally ill patients. It also shows how family members have to cope with a chronic, fatal illness. She has been married to Stephen Smith since 1966. Larry Smith said his mother is a fighter and doesn’t let her illness interfere with her life. Smith’s insurance company promised the Oregon hospital it will fund the $100,000 surgery and she will use community fundraisings to pay for related medical expenses. Earlier this year, Smith was supposed to receive a transplant at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, but was told her insurance cap of $100,000 was unacceptable, according to a letter from the hospital. The surgery exceeded that amount. Smith blames that on miscommunication and the problems associated with coordinating tests between doctors in California and Nevada. Her life expectancy is unknown. She also developed diabetes, osteoporosis, has thin skin and bruises and bleeds easily. Even though her illness was brought on from the bad blood transfusion, she said that without it, she would have died that day in 1980. One of Smith’s doctors, Clark Harrison of Gastroenterology Consultants Ltd. in Reno, has been managing her illness for more than a decade, keeping her alive and helping her quality of life. She wants to see her youngest daughter, Sara, 18, grow up. Smith gave birth to Sara six years after she was infected with the virus. Sara is virus free and healthy. The 18-year-old recalled what her mother said to people when they asked about her health.

Some have even suggested that the word _cancer_ itself might be a misnomer. Sandra Lee, a television chef and girlfriend of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, was diagnosed with DCIS in 2015.

Today, Anatolia is sometimes considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, thereby including the western part of the Armenian Highlands and northern Mesopotamia; its eastern and southern borders are coterminous with Turkey's borders. The ancient Anatolian peoples spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages of the Indo-European language family, which were largely replaced by the Greek language during classical antiquity as well as during the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods. The major Anatolian languages included Hittite, Luwian, and Lydian, while other, poorly attested local languages included \n\n  Turkish literature (Türk edebiyatı) comprises oral compositions and written texts in Turkic languages. The Ottoman and Azerbaijani forms of Turkish, which forms the basis of much of the written corpus, were highly influenced by Persian and Arabic literature, and used the Ottoman Turkish alphabet.

The Turkification of Anatolia began under the rule of the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and it continued under the rule of the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and the early 20th century and it has continued under the rule of today's Republic of Turkey. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek.

The AFL came to dominate the Canadian union movement, although there were also radical unions in British Columbia and Catholic ones in Quebec. Debs gradually became convinced of the need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful forces in the economy. One influence was his involvement in the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888, a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of the necessity of organizing along craft lines. After stepping down as Brotherhood Grand Secretary in 1893, Debs organized one of the first industrial unions in the United States, the American Railway Union (ARU), for unskilled workers.

The episode was often depicted in The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit by the painter Stefano di Giovanni, who was known as \"Sassetta\". Of the two episodic depictions of the hermit Anthony's travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter with the demonic figure of a centaur along the pathway in a wood. Many tried to exorcise them by singing the so-called \"Verses of Saint Maurice\" to her, and her sister led her from church to church. Eventually she was brought to the tomb of Raymond, where she was almost instantaneously healed. This association is rather weak in comparison to other icons such as the Salus Populi Romani and the Black Madonna of Częstochowa. According to the tradition as published by the Keras Kardiotissas Monastery, the icon was painted by Saint Lazarus Zographos and was known as the Panagia Kardiotissa (Παναγίας Καρδιώτισσας), due to the depiction of the Mother of God holding the Christ Child to her heart. Historian Stergios Spanakis had argued that the miraculous icon was the reason for the founding of \n\n monastery. The earliest written account of the icon after its abduction comes from a Latin and Italian plaque placed in the church of San Matteo in Via Merulana where it was first venerated by the public in 1499.\n\nQuestion: what is st anthony patron saint of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

China is not part of the calculation, and may be over a trillion dollars. The renminbi (abbreviation: RMB; ; symbol: 元/¥; code: CNY) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China and one of the world's reserve currencies, ranking as the eighth most traded currency in the world as of April 2019. The yuan is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. The idea of fiat currency was established just over a thousand years ago in China during the Yuan, Tang, Song and Ming dynasties. During the Song Dynasty (960-1276), there was a booming business in the Sichan region that led to a shortage of copper money. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government. Following the internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF voted to designate the renminbi as one of several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The RMB became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the United States dollar, euro, British pound, and Japanese yen.\n\nQuestion: what form of currency does china have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Spain is a country located in south-western Europe, bordered by France to the north-east, Portugal to the west, and the small British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar towards the southern tip. Its area is just over 505,000 square kilometers, positioning it as 52nd largest country in the world, and second in the European Union, to which Spain belongs. The territory of Spain is comprised of its mainland (around a fifth of the Iberian Peninsula), the Balearic Islands archipelago, located in the Mediterranean Sea off the mainland’s east coast; the Canary Islands archipelago, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of southern Morocco; and the seaside enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, located in northern Morocco. The country has a population of about 49 million, concentrated mainly in the cities of Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville. The coastal regions of Malaga, Alicante Valencia and Catalonia also have a higher density of population per square kilometer. In total, there are 17 communities plus Ceuta and Melilla, and 50 provinces. The cradle of Catalan culture, amongst many other cultures and civilizations, and a witness to major transformations such as the Industrial Revolution or the Civil War amongst many others, Barcelona has a fascinating history. The first human settlements in Barcelona date back to Neolithic times. The city itself was founded by the Romans who set up a colony called Barcino at the end of the 1st century BC. For over 200 years, Barcelona was under Muslim rule and, following the Christian reconquest, it became a county of the Carolingian Empire and one of the main residences of the court of the Crown of Aragon. The fruitful medieval period established Barcelona’s position as the economic and political hub of the Western Mediterranean. A period of cultural recovery began in the mid-19th century with the arrival of the textile industry. The 20th century ushered in widespread urban renewal throughout Barcelona city, culminating in its landmark Example district, which showcases some of Barcelona’s most distinctive Catalan art-nouveau, or modernista, buildings. The Catalan Antoni Gaudí, one of the most eminent architects, designed buildings such as the Casa Milà (known as La Pedrera, the Catalan for stone quarry), the Casa Batlló and the Sagrada Família church, which have become world-famous landmarks. With the reinstatement of democracy in 1978, Barcelona society regained its economic strength and the Catalan language was restored. The city’s hosting of the 1992 Olympic Games gave fresh impetus to Barcelona’s potential and reaffirmed its status as a major metropolis. An example of the renewed vigour with which Barcelona is looking towards the 21st century. Many restaurants, especially those in the city centre, have menus in several languages.

In the words of the modern tourist slogan for the \"two Gâtinais\", it lies between the Seine and the Loire. The west part of Puisaye and the archbishop's other fiefs in the northwest of the modern department of Yonne, west of that river, are also often considered part of Gâtinais; as is the area around Étampes in the present department of Essonne.

In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. The Patriots' victory was their fourth overall and first since Super Bowl XXXIX, ending a 10-year championship drought.

The 2006 edition of Pro Football Prospectus listed the 2004 Steelers as one of their \"Heartbreak Seasons\", in which teams \"dominated the entire regular season only to falter in the playoffs, unable to close the deal.\" Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others which were imported by immigrants. Its GDP \n\n American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single \"mainstream\" American accent. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years. The Giza Plateau is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \"Great Pyramid\" and the \"Pyramid of Cheops\"), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \"Queen's pyramids\", and the Great Sphinx of Giza. The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Initially standing at 146.5 m, the Great Pyramid \n\n did not credit him with either the designing of the Pyramid of Djoser or the invention of stone architecture. The most imposing one was the Great Pyramid of Giza, made for Pharaoh Khufu in circa 2589-2566 BC. The stone blocks were held together by mortar, and the entire structure was covered with highly polished white limestone, with their tops topped in gold. Despite being highly associated with the Ancient Egyptians, pyramids have been built by other civilisations to, like the Mayans or the Aztecs.\n\nQuestion: where is giza pyramids located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South. Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. The large population increase can somewhat be attributed to Texas' relative insulation from the U.S. housing bubble. At the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. Its apportioned population in 2020 was 29,183,290.

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's.

Although Service Merchandise was early to embrace the Internet in the 1990s, generating tens of millions of dollars in sales, it was not enough to offset the damage done by the mega-chain stores springing up nationwide. The company responded to the market pressures with a series of restructuring plans that included the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines such as electronics, toys and sporting goods, and refocusing on jewelry, gifts, and home decor products. Many of their showrooms were also closed or downsized significantly. During this time, the company was successful in sub-dividing a number of its company-owned stores into two or three units and sub-leasing the newly created spaces to other national chains, thus reducing costs and generating more store traffic. Aldi has forced the other two to cut prices and increase their private label product ranges. For example, in 2009 51% of Wal-Mart's $251 billion domestic sales were recorded from grocery goods.

In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789. Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, about 14 years after Mozart (born Salzburg, 1756). In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career. During his youth and musical training in Bonn, Beethoven had extensive, intimate exposure to Mozart's music. Indeed, Lewis Lockwood writes, \"Just as Mozart had once told his father that he was 'soaked in music', so Beethoven was soaked in Mozart.\" In \n\n The following century saw two major German composers come to fame early—Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert.

The constitution of Italy provides for two kinds of binding referendums. This kind of referendum is valid only if at least a majority of electors goes to the polling station. It is forbidden to call a referendum regarding financial laws or laws relating to pardons or the ratification of international treaties. Any citizen entitled to vote in an election to the Chamber of Deputies may participate in a referendum. National-level elections in Italy are called periodically to form a parliament consisting of two houses: the Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) with 630 members; and the Senate of the Republic (Senato della Repubblica) with 315 elected members, plus a few appointed senators for life. Italy is a parliamentary republic: the President of the Republic is elected for a seven-year term by the two houses of Parliament in joint session, together with special electors appointed by the Regional Councils. During its history, Italy has had many political parties, both national and regional, with different party systems. The most recent Italian general election was held on 4 March 2018. Among its provisions are a Western-style bill of rights, the creation of the National Council of Democracy that also oversees the guarantee of those rights and a governmental advisory board which deals with economic and social issues. Greece is a parliamentary representative democratic republic, where the President of Greece is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Greece is the head of government within a multi-party system. Between the restoration of democracy in 1974 and the Greek government-debt crisis the party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative New Democracy and the social-democratic PASOK. The Constitution of Greece, which describes Greece as a \"presidential parliamentary republic\", includes extensive specific guarantees of civil liberties and vests the powers of the head of state in a president elected by parliament. The Greek governmental structure is similar to that found in many other Western democracies, and has been described as a compromise between the French and German models.

Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule. One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Alcohol becomes a symbol through which the characters in the novel negotiate their identities and navigate the changing social and political landscapes. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one. Another way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority. Furthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire. He highlights the negative health consequences associated with excessive drinking and the toll it takes on individuals and society. By incorporating medical sources related to alcohol and inebriation, Rushdie sheds light on the detrimental effects of both personal and societal reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism or means of escape. Overall, Salman Rushdie's use of alcohol and alcoholism in \"Midnight's Children\" offers a multi-dimensional perspective on the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking. The exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" contributes to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, including their guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. The poem portrays the interactions and tensions between Christabel and Geraldine on a visceral and psychological level, rather than simply attributing their actions to supernatural or demonic influences. By examining the implications of a lesbian act in the world of \"Christabel,\" we can gain insight into the complexities of the characters. One aspect that stands out is the reversal of gender expectations in the sexual relationship between Christabel and Geraldine. Furthermore, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in the poem can also shed light on the characters' feelings of guilt and pleasure. Geraldine's guilt may stem from societal expectations and the internalized shame associated with deviating from traditional heterosexual relationships. Christabel, on the other hand, experiences pleasure in her interactions with Geraldine, suggesting a sense of liberation and self-discovery. The manipulation of gender roles and the depiction of lesbian sexuality also provide a contrast to the homosocial bond between Sir Leoline and Sir Roland in Part II of the poem. They not only define the extent of the two women's deviance but also offer a way for the characters to potentially reclaim conventional social roles. Overall, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" adds depth to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. It challenges societal expectations, highlights power dynamics, and delves into the complexities of human relationships and sexual identity. \"Cunning [and] sly ... This babbling Andrew is a casualty of his times, binding his wounds with thick wrappings of words, ideas, bits of story, whatever his spinning mind can unspool for him. One of the things that makes [Andrew] such a terrific comic creation is that he's both maddeningly self-delusive and scarily self-aware: He's a fool, but he's no innocent.\" \"The whole story comes to us as the rambling testimony of a depressed scientist being patiently interviewed, possibly by a government psychiatrist. Andrew flits around the events that led him here — wherever here is: Early in the book he says, \"I don't know what I'm doing here,\" which makes two of us. He sometimes speaks of himself in the third person; he regularly mocks his unnamed interrogator; and he pays no attention to chronology. It's our job to put the tragic incidents of his life in order, to unscramble the taunting clues, to unearth the profundities buried in this misanthropic rumination. \"Andrew's Brain\" hurt mine. The problem isn't that the novel requires a significant degree of intellectual effort; it's that it doesn't provide sufficient reward for that effort.\" It is an enormous undertaking for Teresa, and for Tim and Sat, too.

But 98 per cent of us in the UK are still meat eaters. This unique National Geographic docudrama traces the life of a man, Adam, from the Cradle to the Grave, explaining the science behind our highs and lows, the rites of passage we all go through and exploring the inner workings of our bodies and how they change through time. The 90-year-old narrator, Adam, reflects on his life from conception through boyhood, adolescence and beyond, revealing the events that shape him. Along the way we meet the class bully, Adam's first love and the sergeant major preparing him and fellow recruits for Vietnam. It’s no surprise; they are cheap, convenient and easy. Anja Taylor looks at whether exercise impacts aging and if changes in your mitochondria resulting from exercise effectively retard aging. Over your lifetime you undergo an extraordinary change - no other animal on earth goes through such a dramatic metamorphosis. We love our potato chips, candy, and fast food…however bad they are for our health. How exactly does the relentless agribusiness keep us coming back for more? How does it mold our tastes, influence our cravings and feed our addictions? As his name suggests, rapper and documentary maker Professor Green has a past relationship with cannabis. With those days behind him, Professor Green, aka Stephen Manderson, embarks on a uniquely personal film to take an in-depth look at our relationship with Britain’s most popular illegal drug and explores the arguments for and against legalisation. As he comes to reflect on his background and wrestle with his own past, Stephen explores addiction and the links between cannabis use and mental health. On the other hand, I have kidney disease and heart issues. I wrote about the lessons I learned from this journey in a manuscript called “Original Parts: Aging and Reckoning with Cystic Fibrosis Related Kidney Disease”. It’s a good example of how “writing where it hurts” can enrich academic literature as surely as it can expand general knowledge about improving care for people with health challenges.

The author of this post is a transgender person conducting research on higher education in the United States. Here, in Part Three, they share the rest of their informal interviews with these scholars picking up at question 3. How do you hold yourself accountable for gender-expansive praxis? Scholar #1: I try to be honest with myself about … if I’m really asking those questions and pushing on those assumptions consistently. I step back when I think I might be going down a scholarly road that isn’t my place. Scholar #2: I think that holding myself accountable starts with my inner work. I’m the first to acknowledge that I’m a work in progress and don’t always get it right. Yet, I also want them to know that they’ll get things wrong too and that it’s important for us to learn together in community and work to get it right. These are all important practice that come to mind around holding myself accountable. Scholar #1: In my life, I’ve come to understand a few things about social change work. One is that we’re stronger together, when we work across coalitions and join forces to address persistent social problems like sexual violence. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, I really believe this. But I also think it’s imperative for each of us to figure out how we can get outside of only our own oppression and work actively to end another’s, lest we become a bit too myopic and self-serving in how we do the work. I can’t only, always, ever think about cis women’s oppression, though it is real and ending it is important to me. That can’t be the whole focus of my work, because then, I am only advancing myself and others like me. And I will say, that I think that being white and affluent means I need to think hard about how to do\n\nQuestion: what did john irving wrote?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is an English-based Creole language spoken by the Afro-Carib immigrants who have settled primarily in Limón Province along the Caribbean coast. ; Spain has an embassy in San José. The rise of ecotourism in Costa Rica over the past decade has resulted in an extensive expansion in the job market. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that all citizens feel as though they have reaped the benefits of a successful economy, as some Costa Ricans “view the growth of tourism as the ‘kidnapping of a nation’ in which they have no say or opportunities to get involved\".

Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. In the summer-autumn of 1941, the lands which were annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Germany in the course of the initially successful German attack on the USSR. After a \n\n front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Centre was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper at the end of the Second Battle of Smolensk. Furious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, Walther von Brauchitsch, on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the Wehrmacht, effectively taking control of all military decisions. For the first time since June 1941, Soviet forces had stopped the Germans and driven them back. This resulted in an overconfident Stalin further expanding the offensive. ; 1941: Germany invades the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa; fails to capture Moscow or Leningrad. ; 1942: Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany commence the Holocaust – a Final Solution, with the murder of 6 million Jews. ; 1943: After Stalingrad and Kursk, Soviet forces begin recapturing Nazi-occupied territory in the East.\n\nQuestion: what war did hitler lose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. Summary of events The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.

About 100 airlines from more than 50 countries operate flights to JFK. The airport is located along Jamaica Bay near Howard Beach, Queens. The elevated AirTrain JFK people mover system connects JFK to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road. Newark Liberty is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the other two major airports in the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA), along with three smaller airports including Teterboro Airport. In December of that year, New York Airways began scheduled passenger flights, the first airline flights to Manhattan. Three of the busiest are located in Manhattan:\n\n Teterboro Airport is the oldest operating airport in the New York metropolitan area. While other localities had municipal airports, New York City itself had a multitude of private airfields, and thus did not see the need for a municipal airport until the late 1920s. It was followed by Floyd Bennett Field in 1930; New York City's first municipal airport, it built largely in response to the growth of commercial aviation after World War I. LaGuardia Airport was opened in 1939, and Floyd Bennett Field was closed for general aviation two years later. John F.

In 1510, Spanish explorer Diego de Nicuesa founded the first settlement in Panama and named it Nombre de Dios. In September 1513, Spanish conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa arrived to Panama and became the first European to lead an expedition to have seen the Pacific Ocean. In 1513, Panama officially became part of the Spanish Empire. In 1514, Pedro Arias Dávila became the first governor of the territory of Panama. Governor Arias Dávila founded the city of Panama City which he made into the capital of the territory. During this period, Panama became an important territory for Spain as it is situated between the Spanish territories of New Spain and the territories of South America.

The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.

Patrick De'mon Peterson Jr. (born July 11, 1990) is an American football cornerback for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he won the Chuck Bednarik Award as the best defensive player in the country, the Jim Thorpe Award as the best defensive back, and was unanimously recognized as an All-American. He was selected fifth overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Peterson was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first eight seasons in the NFL. In 2021, he signed with the Vikings as a free agent after 10 seasons with Arizona. He played college football for the University of Texas at El Paso, after attending Chabot College in Hayward, California. In 2007, the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) signed him as a free agent. Moore was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the sixth round, 189th overall, of the 2018 NFL Draft.

Furthermore, Penn's vision of peace and religious toleration resonated with the desires of the King and the City merchants. These experiences and accomplishments shaped Penn's approach in establishing complete toleration in Pennsylvania. Lastly, Penn's fair and friendly treatment of the indigenous people in Pennsylvania played a significant role in maintaining peace in the colony. In summary, Penn's ability to establish peace and religious toleration in Pennsylvania was influenced by his social connections, gratitude from the King, support from the City merchants, alignment with the King's goals, advocacy for religious freedom, and his fair treatment of Native Americans. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love,\" derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός adelphós (brother, brotherly). It is the first town in Pennsylvania (and possibly in the United States) laid out by and named after a Jew.

In Germany, Deutsche Telekom modified 50,000 pay phones to take Deutsche Mark coins in 2005, at least on a temporary basis. Callers were allowed to use DM coins, at least initially, with the Deutsche Mark pegged to equal one euro, almost twice the usual rate.

Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \"fission\". The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and \n\n J. J. Thomson thought that the negatively-charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a sea of positive charge that was distributed across the whole volume of the atom. This model is sometimes known as the plum pudding model. Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden came to have doubts about the Thomson model after they encountered difficulties when they tried to build an instrument to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of alpha particles (these are positively-charged particles emitted by certain radioactive substances such as radium). Thomson had encountered a similar problem in his work on cathode rays, which he solved by creating a near-perfect vacuum in his instruments. Rutherford didn't think he'd run into this same problem because alpha particles are much heavier than electrons. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick.\n\nQuestion: what did james chadwick invent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They held elected conventions and \"legislatures\" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They proclaimed that they were states, not colonies. The people exercises this power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making. The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation.

However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel, opera and ballet, and listening to music. She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science. Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81. Career and research While Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research, and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999. Elion's research contributed to the development of: Mercaptopurine (Purinethol), the first treatment for leukemia, also used in organ transplantation. Elion was the fifth female Nobel laureate in Medicine and the ninth in science in general, and one of only a handful of laureates without a doctoral degree. She was the only woman honored with a Nobel Prize that year.\n\nQuestion: who did veronica lake mary?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the early and high Middle Ages, the script was spread by Christian missionaries and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems in Central and Northern Europe, and the remainder of the British Isles,. In the Age of Discovery, the first wave of European colonisation saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the Americas and Australia, whereas \n\n The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium. As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture, during the Roman Empire, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic Latin-speaking people and the Latin-speaking people of Italia, Gaul, Hispania and Dacia whose land was settled by Roman colonists. Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system first spread over the Italian Peninsula with the rise of the Roman Republic from the 4th to the 1st century BCE. By the 4th century, the Latin alphabet had been standardised by the city of Rome and begun to dominate Latium.

When Ringo Starr recorded his first full-fledged pop album, Ringo, Keltner was featured on several tracks. In 1974 Keltner played on the Lennon-produced Harry Nilsson album Pussy Cats alongside Ringo (and Keith Moon) on \"Rock Around the Clock\". Keltner was featured on the Nilsson albums Son of Schmilsson with Harrison, Starr and Beatles associate Klaus Voormann as well as Duit on \n\n tape of the piece, but the two did not interact again. Based on the 1956 single \"You Can't Catch Me\" by American guitarist Chuck Berry, the composition began as an up-tempo blues number, only slightly altering Berry's original lyric of \"Here come a flattop / He was movin' up with me\" to \"Here come ol' flattop / He come groovin' up slowly\". George Martin produced the session, assisted by balance engineers Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald. At McCartney's request, the session marked Emerick's first with the group since July 1968, having quit working with them during sessions for their 1968 album, The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"), due to what he found a tense and negative atmosphere.

Lucy Washburn was a fussy baby. That's just what kind of baby Lucy was. But when Cynthia noticed at 3 months what looked like a hernia around Lucy's groin, she decided to take her to the pediatrician near their home in Winter Park, Colorado, nestled into the mountains west of Denver at about 9,500 feet. An hour later, Lucy was in a helicopter rushing to Children's Hospital Colorado while her parents drove down behind. It was a frightening ordeal, particularly for Cynthia, who, as a teen, had suffered a meningococcal infection that came on suddenly, shut down her major organs and put her in a coma that lasted weeks. It left her with skin grafts all over her body. Doctors were forced to amputate her legs. \"My mom flew out from Australia when Lucy was in the hospital,\" Cynthia recalls. Lucy's condition stayed distressingly touch-and-go for three months. But once she was stable, they sent her home. Then, in April of last year, a routine blood test showed Lucy’s platelet count rapidly dropping. \"It's like a Ferrari someone cut the brakes on. Drs. Hence the anemia. Hence the low platelet count. In Lucy's case, Drs. Its power is immediate and immense. That's what was happening to Lucy, and the complement system's sudden spiral led to another 7 weeks in the hospital. That would save her life, but it would also leave her complement system powerless against meningococcal disease — the same infection that had taken Cynthia's legs. \"That was a difficult conversation to have,\" says Dr. Dixon. He speculated it was possible that the same underlying defect had caused Cynthia's infection. Drs. Her condition was so rare that, once she entered the trial, Children's Colorado became one of just two sites in the world with more than one patient enrolled. Lucy's platelet count went up and her blood pressure stabilized. Drs. One of them belongs to Dr. Frazer-Abel: Exsera BioLabs, just across the street from Children's Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus. \"We're friends with Exsera,\" says Dr. Goebel. It took courage and a sure hand\n\n She was born in the Levant in the eighth century AD to a rich family living in Syria and when she grew up, she committed her life to chastity in honor of Jesus Christ. She went to the monastery of the Virgins in Akhmim and became a nun. At the age of 26, she became the head of the monastery in the era of Pope Michael I. During a period of turmoil that was experienced in the era of Marwan II Caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, some of his soldiers attacked the monastery of the Archangel Michael for the purpose of plundering and raping nuns. When they saw Veronica and her beauty, they decided not \n\n extreme bodily penances\" to deal with the temptation. She was \"greatly honoured\" in Siena and called \"a popular curiosity in the town\" due to her many reported miracles, ecstasies, and trances. According to Loyola Press, she was a saint because of her charitable works, not her trances, demonstrated by her forgiveness towards a group of people who abused her during a trance, despite the excruciating pain they caused her. She ministered to the sick and the poor, moving into the hospital in Siena towards the end of her life, \"subjecting herself to great mortifications\". She is believed to have experienced ecstasies and visions, and healed at least four people. She performed charitable works everyday, up to her death in 1309. Her feast day is April 26. Lucy Smith was born in Chicago in 1925. Her mother, Viola, died when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \"Little Lucy Smith\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer. In two years she had become a skilled gospel accompanist, \n\nLucy was a perfectly healthy infant until the fall of 2011, when her parents noticed that the shape of her head was changing - a bump, a protrusion was forming in the back of her skull and her forehead was becoming more prominent. After extensive online research, Lucy's mom, Katie, came across a condition that fit Lucy's symptoms: craniosynostosis, a premature fusion of the cranial sutures between the bones of a baby's skull. Babies are born with incompletely fused skull bones to accommodate brain growth during infancy. In the spring of 2012, the Jenkins family came to Johns Hopkins Children's Center where they met pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. George Jallo and plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Amir Dorafshar. Before the surgery, Lucy underwent a 3-D head CT scan, which allowed the surgeons to meticulously plan every cut before they even made the first incision. \"When Dr. Dorafshar talked to us about it, I immediately felt that it was in Lucy's best interest to have it done. Lucy's parents even saw the computer models of Lucy's head along with the planned cuts and reconstruction. On Aug. 8, 2012 Lucy underwent a five-and-a-half-hour surgery. Thankfully, the rest of the procedure was uneventful, and Lucy went to the pediatric intensive care unit that day. However, when Dr. Dorafshar stopped by the PICU that day to check on her, he saw an alarming sign - Lucy's abdomen was so swollen that it was pushing on her lungs causing her to have difficulty breathing. Lucy had developed abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of the fast infusion of blood during the surgery. To release the penned up fluid from her abdomen, Lucy had to have a minor procedure, which relieved pressure and restored normal breathing. The only thing I remember about that time was hearing Dr. Dorafshar's voice, and that was all I could focus on. By the time, she left the hospital, Lucy was sitting up on her own, crawling around her crib, playing, laughing and talking. Today, Lucy is perfectly healthy, much to the delight of her parents and surgeons. Lucy loves to visit Hopkins and knows the doctors and staff took excellent care of her; when asked about her doctors, she fondly says \"they fixed my head!\" \"I can't say enough about the care Lucy received while she was in the hospital,\" Katie says. \"Lucy's surgery changed my life, and I will always be so thankful for the care Lucy received, in particular from Dr. Dorafshar, Dr. Jallo, Dr. Carson, Dr. Whitaker, Dr. Greenberg, Dr. Abdullah, and all of the attending physicians, PICU nurses and staff.

His improvements to the telescope, astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism were all integral to the Copernican Revolution. Based on the designs of Hans Lippershey, Galileo designed his own telescope which, in the following year, he had improved to 30x magnification. Using this new instrument, Galileo made a number of astronomical observations which he published in the Sidereus Nuncius in 1610. In this book, he described the surface of the Moon as rough, uneven, and imperfect. He also noted that \"the boundary dividing the bright from the dark part does not form a uniformly oval line, as would happen in a perfectly spherical solid, but is \n\n Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (, ; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642), commonly referred to as Galileo, was an astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa, in modern-day Italy.

Neither the contents of Galileo's science, nor the methods of study he selected were in keeping with Aristotelian teachings. During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler.

Benefits of mullein for specific health conditions include the following:\n\n• _Bronchitis, cough, influenza, and sore throat._ Mullein relieves upper respiratory congestion in two ways. Peony has been used since ancient times for its appealing scent, beautiful blooms, and medicinal benefits. Peony has one of the longest histories of any flowering herb, and has been used since ancient times both as an ornamental and medicinal plant. Peony root has hepatoprotective effects, which can lower bilirubin levels, and it is often used to promote liver health and treating viral hepatitis. Peony's anti-inflamatory, immunostimulant properties have proven effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other related conditions, as well as for relieving muscle spasms and menstrual cramps. Studies have shown peony's ability to support brain function, improving cognition, memory, and mood. A decoction of peony's root has been used for centuries in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis, dysmenorrhea, muscle cramping, spasms, and even fever. All peony species contain high amounts of anti-inflammatory glucosides, but paeoniflorin is the most abundant one, and it is largely responsible for peony's medicinal actions, though other compounds likely play a role as well. The hepatoprotective effects of peony's root are related to its ability to lower bilirubin levels and other indicators of toxicity in the liver. Furthermore, peony properties notably include neuroprotective and mildly sedative effects, which have been shown to benefit brain function, improving cognition and mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. PEONY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ENHANCE BRAIN FUNCTION, INCLUDING MEMORY, COGNITION AND MOOD. Peony has been traditionally used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a coagulant agent, for treating painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), bleeding wounds, and nose bleeding. Although peony has been found to be generally safe for the liver, it is important to consult a physician or psychiatrist before taking it for depression. Although the culinary uses of the peony are less known, due to its pleasant sweetness, the herb is used as a flavoring, in China and elsewhere in the world. The dried roots of peony can be added to many dishes, as well as made into medicinal preparations. Peony powder can be used for culinary purposes, due to its sweetness, and also be consumed for its hepatoprotective, relaxing, and anti-inflammatory properties. Peony properties have been used in this form for centuries in Tradicional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating liver diseases, joint pain, asthma, and many other health conditions. In this popular form, peony can help soothing the nerves and enhancing mood, as well as relieving arthritic pain and menstrual cramps. Extracted from the peony flower, this essential oil is popularly used in aromatherapy to soothe the nerves. Obtained from the distillation of peony's root, this medicinal preparation is used, previously diluted in water, for treating hepatitis and other liver ailments, as well as for relieving arthritis and enhancing cognitive functions. This is a very popular form of reaping peony benefits, since it comes in standardized daily doses for a complementary treatment of joint pain, as well as for liver support and nerve function. Peony essential oil and liquid extract, as well as capsules and tablets are mainly found in natural health stores and online retailers. THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF PEONY SUPPLEMENT CHOICES AVAILABLE THROUGH ONLINE RETAILERS. However, with dedication and basic care, it can be a beautiful addition to any home garden. To not overcrowd the bushes, it is important to plant peony bulbs at least two feet (60 cm) apart. Peony bulbs should be planted in the fall (late September and October) no more than two inches (5 cm) below the soil. Fertilizers must be applied to peony bush with adequate dosages of potassium and phosphorus, and there should be no excess of nitrogen. Peonies are native to southern Europe, western North America, and Asia, and all species are distinguishable by their deeply-lobed leaves and fragrant flowers, with satin, ruffled petals, which can be simple (with a single line of petals), semi-double (five or more outer guard petals with a center of smaller inner petals); or double (Five or more outer guard petals with a center of stamens and carpels that for a full body blossom), along with different combinations of the above. The height of a peony plant depends on the type. Herbaceous peonies grow to a height of two to four feet (61-122 cm), whereas woody tree peonies can reach four to six feet (122-183 cm). Peony, or Paeonia officinalis, is a member of the Paeoniaceae family, which includes about 40 species of flowering plants. Over the last 4,000 years, many different varieties and subspecies of the peony family have been cultivated throughout the world. There are four types of peonies that are generally grown in gardens; the woodland peony (Paeonia japonica), the woody tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa), the garden or herbaceous peony (Paeonia officinalis hybrids), and the intersectional peony (also known as the Itoh, a hybrid of the garden and tree peonies). The development of different cultivars has broadened the scope of peony blossom colors, which can range from crimson to white. Examples include the magenta 'Rubra Plena' and the white 'Alba Plena' with pink tinges. Peony is mentioned several times throughout ancient Greek and Roman medical treatises, as well as during the Middle Ages.
