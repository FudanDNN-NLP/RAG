['The logistic curve is a sigmoid curve that is commonly used to model the growth of a population. It is a mathematical representation of the growth of a population over time, and it is characterized by a slow start, a rapid growth phase, and a plateau phase. The curve is defined by the following equation:\n\nN(t) = (N0 * K) / (N0 * K + (e^(-r * t) - 1))\n\nwhere N(t) is the population at time t, N0 is the initial population, K is the carrying capacity, and r is the intrinsic rate of growth.\n\nThe carrying capacity is the maximum population that the environment can support. This is the point at which the population reaches a stable state and stops growing. The intrinsic rate of growth is the rate at which the population would grow if there were no limiting factors.\n\nThe logistic curve is useful for understanding population growth and for predicting future population sizes. It can also be used to model the growth of other systems, such as economic systems or disease outbreaks.\n\nIn terms of controlling mosquito populations, the most effective means is to reduce the carrying capacity. This can be done by removing breeding sites, such as standing water, or by introducing natural predators or parasites that prey on mosquitoes. By reducing the carrying capacity, the population will grow more slowly and will eventually reach a', 'Based on the characteristic population curves that result from plotting population growth of a species, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is toBased on the characteristic population curves that result from plotting population growth of a species, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is to\nA. maintain the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve\nB. opt for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached\nC. reduce the carrying capacity cif the environment to lower the K value\nD. increase the mortality rate']

  Biological exponential growth is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the habitat, the population of an organism living in the habitat grows in an exponential or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each

If, in a hypothetical population of size N, the birth rates (per capita) are represented as b and death rates (per capita) as d, then the increase or decrease in N during a time period t will be: (b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth. Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the elephant could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

 = the beneficial effect of a mutualistic partner's density. One of the simplest frameworks for modeling species interactions is the Lotka–Volterra equations. In this model, the change in population density of the two mutualists is quantified as: Mutualism is in essence the logistic growth equation + mutualistic interaction. The mutualistic interaction term represents the increase in population growth of species one as a result of the presence of greater numbers of species two, and vice versa. As the mutualistic term is always positive, it may lead to unrealistic unbounded growth as it happens with the simple model. So, it is important to include a saturation mechanism to avoid the problem.

  that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth. Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans. Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as Charles Darwin observed

That is, each generation is twice the size of the previous. If the population of the first generation is arbitrarily set at 100, the second is then 200, and the third is 400. The spreadsheet below shows the initial population in the first row. First note that the second and third generation of the initial population are each twice the size of the previous.

  At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the main determinant for population growth is just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the logistic equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density. The logistic growth curve is initially very similar to the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because

   The major impact of intraspecific competition is reduced population growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, intraspecific competition does not occur and populations can grow exponentially. Exponential population growth is exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew exponentially in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place. . dN(t)/dt = rate of change of population density N(t) = population size at time t r = per capita growth rate K = carrying capacity  The logistic growth equation is an effective tool for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, and has been used to model many real biological

The initial population has grown from 700 to 1,200 even though fertility dropped from four to replacement (two) at the end of the third generation. If the population of the first generation is arbitrarily set at 100, the second is then 200, and the third is 400. The spreadsheet below shows the initial population in the first row. First note that the second and third generation of the initial population are each twice the size of the previous. The total of the initial population is 700 = 100 + 200 + 400.

['A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that occurs when a single nucleotide is either inserted or deleted in a gene, causing a shift in the reading frame of the mRNA. This results in the production of a non-functional or truncated protein, as the altered reading frame causes a premature stop codon to be introduced, or the introduction of a premature stop codon due to the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide. Frameshift mutations can have significant effects on protein function and can lead to genetic disorders.\n\nFor example, in the case of sickle cell anemia, a frameshift mutation in the beta-globin gene causes a single amino acid substitution, resulting in the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein that can cause red blood cells to become misshapen and less effective at carrying oxygen. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and organ damage.\n\nIn contrast, in the case of cystic fibrosis, a frameshift mutation in the CFTR gene causes a premature stop codon to be introduced, resulting in the production of a non-functional CFTR protein. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including lung infections, digestive problems, and infertility.\n\nFrameshift mutations can also occur in non-coding regions', "A frameshift mutation is created whenA frameshift mutation is created when\nA. telomeric sequences are removed from DNA\nB. a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one\nC. a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene\nD. a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation"]

  Insertions can be particularly hazardous if they occur in an exon, the amino acid coding region of a gene. A frameshift mutation, an alteration in the normal reading frame of a gene, results if the number of inserted nucleotides is not divisible by three, i.e., the number of nucleotides per codon. Frameshift mutations will alter all the amino acids encoded by the gene following the mutation. Usually, insertions and the subsequent frameshift mutation will cause the active translation of the gene to encounter a premature stop codon, resulting in an end to translation and the production of a truncated protein. Transcripts carrying the frameshift mutation may also be degraded through Nonsense-mediated decay during translation, thus not resulting in any protein product. If

  Several mutations in the CFTR gene can occur, and different mutations cause different defects in the CFTR protein, sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease. These protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function. ΔF508-CFTR gene mutation, which occurs in >90% of patients in the U.S., creates a protein that does not fold normally and is not appropriately transported to the cell membrane, resulting in its degradation. Other mutations result in proteins that are too short (truncated) because production is ended prematurely. Other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy (in the form of ATP) normally,

  the truncated proteins frequently are unable to function properly or at all and can possibly result in any number of genetic disorders depending on the gene in which the insertion occurs. Methods to detect DNA sequencing errors were developed. In-frame insertions occur when the reading frame is not altered as a result of the insertion; the number of inserted nucleotides is divisible by three. The reading frame remains intact after the insertion and translation will most likely run to completion if the inserted nucleotides do not code for a stop codon. However, because of the inserted nucleotides, the finished protein will contain, depending on the size of the insertion, multiple new amino acids that may affect the function of the protein.

 Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are either inserted or deleted in the DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code. This shift alters the way codons are read during protein synthesis, leading to significant changes in the resulting polypeptide chain. 

Compared to missense and nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations can have more severe consequences. Missense mutations result in the substitution of a single amino acid in the protein sequence, whereas nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon, leading to the truncation of the polypeptide chain. Frameshift mutations, on the other hand, disrupt the entire reading frame, significantly altering the sequence of amino acids in the protein.

These mutations can have varying effects depending on the size and position of the insertion or deletion. If one or two nucleotides are added or removed, the resulting frameshift can lead to a completely different sequence of amino acids, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. In cases of deletions, one amino acid is usually deleted for every three nucleotides removed.

Frameshift mutations can have severe consequences and are associated with various genetic disorders. For example, conditions like cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease can be caused by frameshift mutations. The abundance of insertions in Huntington's disease disrupts the normal genetic code, leading to the degeneration of the nervous system.

In summary, frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, causing a shift in the reading frame during protein synthesis. These mutations can have significant consequences, altering the amino acid sequence and potentially affecting the structure and function of the resulting protein.

 The three major categories of mutations that cells can inherit are deletions, base substitutions (also known as point mutations), and insertions. Deletions occur when DNA polymerase fails to copy all the DNA in the parent strand, leading to the loss of genetic material. Base substitutions, on the other hand, happen when the wrong nucleotides are paired together during DNA replication. This results in a change of a single nucleotide, causing a point mutation. Finally, insertions occur when extra nucleotides are inserted into the DNA sequence during replication or repair processes.

Deletions can have various effects on an organism, depending on the size and location of the deleted DNA. They can lead to frameshift mutations, where the reading frame of the genetic code is altered, potentially resulting in a non-functional protein.

Base substitutions or point mutations can also have a range of effects. Silent mutations have no impact on the protein or organism, as they do not alter the amino acid sequence due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Missense mutations, on the other hand, change the amino acids in the protein, potentially affecting its structure and function. Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in the mRNA, resulting in the production of a truncated protein that is likely non-functional.

Insertions can cause frameshift mutations as well, similar to deletions. The addition of extra nucleotides disrupts the normal reading frame of the genetic code, altering the amino acid sequence and potentially leading to a non-functional protein.

It is important to note that the effects of mutations can vary greatly depending on the specific gene involved, the location and type of mutation, and the resulting changes to the protein.

  CF is caused by a mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation, ΔF508, is a deletion (Δ signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position on the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70% ) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 1500 other mutations can produce CF. Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an autosomal recessive disease. The CFTR gene, found at the q31.2

 There are several different types of mutations that can occur in DNA, each with their own effects on protein function. Some of the common types of mutations include frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, silent mutations, and missense mutations.

Frameshift mutations occur when a deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that are not divisible by three happens. This disrupts the reading frame of the DNA sequence and leads to misreading of all nucleotides downstream. Frameshift mutations usually result in the production of a nonfunctional protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, occur when a nucleotide substitution results in the creation of an early stop codon. This premature stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis, leading to the production of a truncated and often nonfunctional protein. An example of a disease caused by a nonsense mutation is sickle cell disease, where the substitution of a nucleotide leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein.

Silent mutations are nucleotide substitutions where the new codon codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. These mutations often occur at the third position of the codon, which is more flexible due to the phenomenon known as "tRNA wobble." Silent mutations do not result in any change in the amino acid sequence and typically have no effect on protein function.

Missense mutations, on the other hand, result in a nucleotide substitution that leads to the production of a different amino acid in the protein sequence. The impact of missense mutations on protein function can vary depending on the specific substitution. If the new amino acid has a similar chemical structure to the original amino acid, it is considered a conservative missense mutation. However, if the new amino acid is significantly different, it can affect the protein's structure and function. Sickle cell disease is an example of a missense mutation where the substitution of glutamic acid with valine in the hemoglobin protein leads to abnormal red blood cell shape.

In general, the severity of the damage caused by mutations can be ranked as follows: silent mutations have the least impact, followed by missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations, which have the most severe effects on protein function.

 A point mutation refers to a genetic mutation where a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted, or deleted from a DNA or RNA sequence of an organism's genome. This type of mutation can have various effects on protein production depending on the specific mutation. 

The consequences of point mutations can range from having no effect to causing significant changes in protein production, composition, and function. Some point mutations are synonymous, meaning they do not change the amino acid sequence and have no impact on protein production. However, other point mutations can lead to non-synonymous changes, altering the amino acid sequence and affecting protein structure and function. These non-synonymous mutations can be further classified into different types such as missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.

Missense mutations occur when a single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence. This change may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the specific amino acid substitution and its location within the protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, introduce a premature stop codon into the protein-coding sequence. This leads to the production of a truncated and usually non-functional protein. The premature termination of protein synthesis affects its structure and potentially disrupts its normal function.

Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a DNA or RNA sequence, altering the reading frame during translation. This can lead to a shift in the coding sequence, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. Frameshift mutations often have severe consequences as they dramatically change the protein's structure and function.

Point mutations are generally caused by DNA replication errors or exposure to mutagens, which can be physical (such as UV rays or X-rays) or chemical agents that disrupt DNA structure or base pairing. Understanding the causes and consequences of point mutations is important for studying genetic diseases, cancer development, and developing strategies for prevention and treatment.

These are commonly seen in muscular dystrophies and some cystic fibrosis cases. **Aminoglycosides are currently being used to treat premature stop codons** as they affect the translational accuracy of transfer RNA (tRNA), thereby allowing recognition of incorrect codons including the stop codon. Ultimately, the translation machinery reads through the premature stop codon because of altered amino acid insertion by tRNA and produces full-length protein instead of a truncated protein or degraded messenger RNA (mRNA). **Table 13-1 • EXAMPLES OF MUTATIONAL EVENTS SILENT MUTATION**

These 2 types of mutations can cause a shift in the open reading frame, called **frameshift mutations,** of a gene if the **insertion or deletion** is a **multiple of 1 or 2 bases. ** In the case of sickle cell hemoglobin, adenine is replaced by thymine, causing a hydrophilic glutamic acid to be replaced with a hydrophobic valine in the resulting protein (Table 13-2). In a **nonsense mutation, the mutation brings about a premature stop in the gene of interest** because the altered codon now represents a stop codon (Table 13-3). Ultimately, the translation machinery reads through the premature stop codon because of altered amino acid insertion by tRNA and produces full-length protein instead of a truncated protein or degraded messenger RNA (mRNA). **Table 13-1 • EXAMPLES OF MUTATIONAL EVENTS SILENT MUTATION**

**Table 13-2 • MISSENSE MUTATION**

**Table 13-3 • NONSENSE MUTATION**

**Table 13-4 • FRAMESHIFT MUTATION**

Another type of mutation is a **deletion in which 1 or more DNA bases have been removed. These 2 types of mutations can cause a shift in the open reading frame, called **frameshift mutations,** of a gene if the **insertion or deletion** is a **multiple of 1 or 2 bases.Both cases present major problems because the altered protein will not likely be able to carry out the normal duties required of it.Because codons are read as multiples of 3, an insertion or deletion of 3 or a multiple of 3 may or may not be as deleterious to the gene as multiples of 1 or 2. Frameshift mutations occur when a deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that are not divisible by three happens. Frameshift mutations usually result in the production of a nonfunctional protein. Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, occur when a nucleotide substitution results in the creation of an early stop codon. This premature stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis, leading to the production of a truncated and often nonfunctional protein. An example of a disease caused by a nonsense mutation is sickle cell disease, where the substitution of a nucleotide leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein. These mutations often occur at the third position of the codon, which is more flexible due to the phenomenon known as "tRNA wobble." In general, the severity of the damage caused by mutations can be ranked as follows: silent mutations have the least impact, followed by missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations, which have the most severe effects on protein function.

Answer: 
2024-06-13 12:17:45 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are either inserted or deleted in the DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code. Compared to missense and nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations can have more severe consequences. Frameshift mutations, on the other hand, disrupt the entire reading frame, significantly altering the sequence of amino acids in the protein. If one or two nucleotides are added or removed, the resulting frameshift can lead to a completely different sequence of amino acids, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. Frameshift mutations can have severe consequences and are associated with various genetic disorders. For example, conditions like cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease can be caused by frameshift mutations. In summary, frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, causing a shift in the reading frame during protein synthesis. A point mutation refers to a genetic mutation where a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted, or deleted from a DNA or RNA sequence of an organism's genome. The consequences of point mutations can range from having no effect to causing significant changes in protein production, composition, and function. Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a DNA or RNA sequence, altering the reading frame during translation. Frameshift mutations often have severe consequences as they dramatically change the protein's structure and function. Point mutations are generally caused by DNA replication errors or exposure to mutagens, which can be physical (such as UV rays or X-rays) or chemical agents that disrupt DNA structure or base pairing. Reference: Adapted from "A point mutation is a genetic mutation..."

The three major categories of mutations that cells can inherit are deletions, base substitutions (also known as point mutations), and insertions. This results in a change of a single nucleotide, causing a point mutation. They can lead to frameshift mutations, where the reading frame of the genetic code is altered, potentially resulting in a non-functional protein. Insertions can cause frameshift mutations as well, similar to deletions.

  Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage. Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. Older sources, particularly before the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as "higher vertebrates" and anamniotes as "lower vertebrates", based on the antiquated idea of the evolutionary great chain of being. The term amniote comes from the Greek ἀμνίον amnion, "membrane surrounding the fetus", and earlier "bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught", from ἀμνός amnos, "lamb". The amnion comprises several extensive membranes. In eutherian mammals (such as humans), these include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. The

  formation of several extensive membranes, the amnion, chorion, and allantois. Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with limbs and a thick stratified epithelium (rather than first entering a feeding larval tadpole stage followed by metamorphosis, as amphibians do). In amniotes, the transition from a two-layered periderm to a cornified epithelium is triggered by thyroid hormone during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis. The unique embryonic features of amniotes may reflect specializations for eggs to survive drier environments; or the increase in size and yolk content of eggs may have permitted, and coevolved with, direct development of the embryo to a large size.

 The function of the amniotic sac in the development of a mammal, bird, or reptile embryo or fetus is to protect and support the developing embryo/fetus. The amniotic sac, also known as the amnion, is a thin, tough, membranous sac that encloses the embryo/fetus. It is filled with a serous fluid called amniotic fluid, in which the embryo/fetus is suspended.

The amniotic sac serves several important functions. Firstly, it provides a protective barrier that helps to cushion the developing embryo/fetus from external shocks and injuries. It acts as a physical barrier, shielding the growing organism from any direct contact with the environment.

Secondly, the amniotic fluid within the sac helps to regulate the temperature of the embryo/fetus. It helps to maintain a stable and optimal temperature, which is crucial for proper development. The fluid also helps to prevent the embryo/fetus from drying out and provides a medium for movement, allowing the embryo/fetus to stretch, flex, and develop muscle tone.

Additionally, the amniotic fluid plays a vital role in the development of the respiratory and digestive systems of the embryo/fetus. By swallowing and inhaling the fluid, the embryo/fetus practices breathing and swallowing movements, which are essential for the proper functioning of these systems after birth.

In summary, the amniotic sac functions to protect, support, and provide an optimal environment for the development of the embryo/fetus. It acts as a physical barrier, regulates temperature, prevents dehydration, and aids in the development of vital systems.

  appears they separated from the other tetrapods somewhere during Romer's gap, when the adult tetrapods became fully terrestrial (some forms would later become secondarily aquatic). The modest-sized ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, such as depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the Carboniferous swamps and forests; and dry conditions probably do not account for the emergence of the soft shell. Indeed, many modern-day amniotes require moisture to keep their eggs from desiccating. Although some modern amphibians lay eggs on land, all amphibians lack advanced traits like an amnion. The amniotic egg formed through a series of evolutionary steps. After internal fertilization and the habit of laying

  The hyaline layer is responsible for the adhesion and proper orientation if the cells of an embryo. Throughout development, certain cells change their binding affinity towards hyalin. Hyalin helps cells differentiate into the animal and the vegetal halves during oogenesis by utilizing zinc and lithium ions. Zinc enhances the amount of hyalin precipitated, while lithium keeps the hyalin solubilized when around calcium. Zinc, then, causes an animalizing effect since the binding of the blastula cells would be stronger, while the weaker attachment of the cells would form the vegetal half. Cells can further differentiate if they gain an affinity towards other membranes. Invagination of the blastula

  in terrestrial environments became a reproduction strategy amongst the amniote ancestors, the next major breakthrough appears to have involved a gradual replacement of the gelatinous coating covering the amphibian egg with a fibrous shell membrane. This allowed the egg to increase both its size and in the rate of gas exchange, permitting a larger, metabolically more active embryo to reach full development before hatching. Further developments, like extraembryonic membranes (amnion, chorion, and allantois) and a calcified shell, were not essential and probably evolved later. It has been suggested that shelled terrestrial eggs without extraembryonic membranes could still not have been more than about 1 cm (0.4 inch) in diameter because of diffusion problems,

  a blastocyst. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the zona pellucida. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells. The blastocyst reaches the uterus at roughly the fifth day after fertilization. It is here that lysis of the zona pellucida occurs. This process is analogous to zona hatching, a term that refers to the emergence of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, when incubated in vitro. This allows the trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst to come into contact with, and adhere to, the endometrial cells of the uterus. The trophectoderm will eventually give rise to extra-embryonic structures, such as the placenta and the

  Fish and amphibian eggs have only one inner membrane, the embryonic membrane. Evolution of the amniote egg required increased exchange of gases and wastes between the embryo and the atmosphere. Structures to permit these traits allowed further adaption that increased the feasible size of amniote eggs and enabled breeding in progressively drier habitats. The increased size of eggs permitted increase in size of offspring and consequently of adults. Further growth for the latter, however, was limited by their position in the terrestrial food-chain, which was restricted to level three and below, with only invertebrates occupying level two. Amniotes would eventually experience adaptive radiations when some species evolved the ability to digest plants and new ecological niches opened up, permitting larger body-size for herbivores, omnivores and predators.

 In addition to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast is responsible for giving rise to another important structure during early embryonic development. This structure is known as the extra-embryonic membranes, which include the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. The trophoblast plays a crucial role in the formation of these membranes, which provide support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo.

The amnion is an important component of the extra-embryonic membranes, and it surrounds the embryo, forming a fluid-filled sac called the amniotic sac. This sac serves to cushion the developing fetus, providing a protective environment during the course of pregnancy.

The chorion is another extra-embryonic membrane that develops from the trophoblast. It becomes the outermost layer of the placenta, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste between the mother and the developing embryo.

The yolk sac, also derived from the trophoblast, plays a crucial role in the early stages of embryonic development. It initially provides nourishment to the embryo before the placenta takes over this role. Additionally, the yolk sac also contributes to the formation of the primitive germ cells, which are essential for the development of the reproductive system.

Lastly, the allantois is an extra-embryonic membrane that arises from the trophoblast. It plays a role in the disposal of waste products and eventually plays a part in the development of the urinary bladder.

In summary, besides giving rise to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast also gives rise to the extra-embryonic membranes, including the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. These structures provide crucial support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo during early embryonic development.

 The chick possesses a set of extraembryonic membranes that support the embryo and facilitate the transfer of nutrients and oxygen. These membranes include the yolk sac, the chorion, the amnion, and the allantois. 

The yolk sac is responsible for providing nutrients to the developing embryo. It surrounds the yolk, which contains the necessary nutrients for the embryo's growth. Blood vessels within the yolk sac transport these nutrients to the embryo.

The chorion is the outermost membrane and plays a significant role in gas exchange. It is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the surrounding environment. This is achieved through a specialized structure called the chorioallantoic membrane, which contains a network of blood vessels that facilitate the exchange of gases.

The amnion is a fluid-filled sac that surrounds and protects the developing embryo. It provides a cushioning effect and helps to maintain a stable environment in which the embryo can develop. The amniotic fluid within the amnion also acts as a medium for the exchange of nutrients and wastes.

Lastly, the allantois is involved in the storage and disposal of waste materials produced by the embryo. It serves as a reservoir for nitrogenous waste and helps in the removal of these waste products from the embryo.

Together, these extraembryonic membranes in the chick work synergistically to support the embryo's growth and development by providing nutrients, facilitating gas exchange, protecting the embryo, and disposing of waste materials.

The amnion is a fluid-filled sac that surrounds and protects the developing embryo. It provides a cushioning effect and helps to maintain a stable environment in which the embryo can develop. Lastly, the allantois is involved in the storage and disposal of waste materials produced by the embryo. Indeed, many modern-day amniotes require moisture to keep their eggs from desiccating. Although some modern amphibians lay eggs on land, all amphibians lack advanced traits like an amnion. After internal fertilization and the habit of laying 

 Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage. Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. In eutherian mammals (such as humans), these include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. This structure is known as the extra-embryonic membranes, which include the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. The amnion is an important component of the extra-embryonic membranes, and it surrounds the embryo, forming a fluid-filled sac called the amniotic sac. The yolk sac, also derived from the trophoblast, plays a crucial role in the early stages of embryonic development. It initially provides nourishment to the embryo before the placenta takes over this role. In summary, besides giving rise to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast also gives rise to the extra-embryonic membranes, including the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. These structures provide crucial support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo during early embryonic development.

['Inositol triphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that stimulates the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, in response to various extracellular signals. IP3 is produced by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). The binding of extracellular signals, such as neurotransmitters or hormones, to their receptors on the cell surface activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 then binds to its receptor, the IP3 receptor (IP3R), on the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the opening of calcium channels and the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. This calcium ion influx can trigger various cellular responses, such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Which of the following is a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm?Which of the following is a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm?\nA.

  Inositol trisphosphate or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate abbreviated InsP3 or Ins3P or IP3 is an inositol phosphate signaling molecule. It is made by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by phospholipase C (PLC). Together with diacylglycerol (DAG), IP3 is a second messenger molecule used in signal transduction in biological cells. While DAG stays inside the membrane, IP3 is soluble and diffuses through the cell, where it binds to its receptor, which is a calcium channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum. When IP3 binds its receptor, calcium is released into the cytosol, thereby activating various calcium regulated intracellular signals.

  and is capable of diffusing through the cytoplasm to the ER, or the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the case of muscle cells, once it has been produced by the action of PLC. Once at the ER, IP3 is able to bind to the IIns(1,4,5)P3 receptor Ins(1,4,5)P3R on a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel that is found on the surface of the ER. The binding of IP3 (the ligand in this case) to Ins(1,4,5)P3R triggers the opening of the Ca2+ channel, and thus release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. In heart muscle cells this increase in Ca2+ activates the ryanodine receptor-operated channel on the SR, results in further increases in Ca2+ through a process known as calcium-induced calcium release. IP3 may also activate Ca2+ channels on the cell membrane indirectly, by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

  IP3's main functions are to mobilize Ca2+ from storage organelles and to regulate cell proliferation and other cellular reactions that require free calcium. In smooth muscle cells, for example, an increase in concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ results in the contraction of the muscle cell. In the nervous system, IP3 serves as a second messenger, with the cerebellum containing the highest concentration of IP3 receptors. There is evidence that IP3 receptors play an important role in the induction of plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

  Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are often a result of IP3 activation. When a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to a Gq heterotrimeric G protein, the α-subunit of Gq can bind to and induce activity in the PLC isozyme PLC-β, which results in the cleavage of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. If a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is involved in activating the pathway, the isozyme PLC-γ has tyrosine residues that can become phosphorylated upon activation of an RTK, and this will activate PLC-γ and allow it to cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP3. This occurs in cells that are capable of responding to growth factors such as insulin, because the growth factors are the ligands responsible for activating the RTK.

  1981 were able to show that PIP2 is hydrolyzed into DAG and IP3 by a then unknown phosphodiesterase. In 1984 it was discovered that IP3 acts as a secondary messenger that is capable of traveling through the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it stimulates the release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Further research provided valuable information on the IP3 pathway, such as the discovery in 1986 that one of the many roles of the calcium released by IP3 is to work with DAG to activate protein kinase C (PKC). It was discovered in 1989 that phospholipase C (PLC) is the phosphodiesterase responsible for hydrolyzing PIP2 into DAG and IP3. Today the IP3 signaling pathway is well mapped out, and is known to be important in regulating a variety of calcium-dependent cell signaling pathways.

  IP3, DAG, and Ca2+ are second messengers in the phosphoinositol pathway. The pathway begins with the binding of extracellular primary messengers such as epinephrine, acetylcholine, and hormones AGT, GnRH, GHRH, oxytocin, and TRH, to their respective receptors. Epinephrine binds to the α1 GTPase Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and acetylcholine binds to M1 and M2 GPCR.  Binding of a primary messenger to these receptors results in conformational change of the receptor. The α subunit, with the help of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFS), releases GDP, and binds GTP, resulting in the dissociation of the subunit and subsequent activation. The activated α subunit activates phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in the formation of secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to calcium pumps on ER, transporting Ca2+, another second messenger, into the cytoplasm. Ca2+ ultimately binds to many proteins, activating a cascade of enzymatic pathways.

  The slow block to polyspermy in the sea urchin is mediated by the PIP2 secondary messenger system. Activation of the binding receptors activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 in the egg plasma membrane, releasing IP3 into the egg cell cytoplasm. IP3 diffuses to the ER, where it opens Ca2+ channels.

 Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) serves an important function in cellular signaling by promoting the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytoplasm. This process is known as calcium release from the ER stores. 

Calcium is a crucial molecule for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and gene expression. IP3 acts as a second messenger, relaying signals from the cell membrane to the ER. 

When a signaling molecule, such as a hormone or a neurotransmitter, binds to its respective receptor on the cell surface, it triggers a cascade of intracellular events. This includes the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), an enzyme that hydrolyzes a specific phospholipid called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). 

IP3 then diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) present on the ER membrane. This binding causes a conformational change in the IP3R, leading to the opening of calcium ion channels in the ER membrane. Consequently, calcium ions are released from the internal stores of the ER and enter the cytoplasm.

The released calcium ions can now interact with various calcium-binding proteins within the cytoplasm, triggering a wide range of cellular responses. These responses can include muscle contraction, enzyme activation, release of neurotransmitters, gene transcription, and many other important processes.

In summary, the function of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is to facilitate the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, leading to the activation of various cellular processes.

The binding of IP3 to its receptor and the subsequent release of calcium into the cytosol is a crucial mechanism for transmitting signals within cells. This process allows for the propagation of signals initiated by extracellular stimuli and ensures the appropriate activation of downstream signaling pathways.

["The synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template requires the use of a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase. This process involves the addition of a DNA or RNA primer to the 3' end of the RNA template, followed by the extension of the primer by reverse transcriptase. The resulting product is a DNA/RNA hybrid, which can be used for various purposes, such as cloning, sequencing, and amplification.\n\nThe primer used in this process can be either DNA or RNA, depending on the specific application. For example, if the RNA template is to be cloned into a plasmid vector, a DNA primer is typically used.

 Made it theoretically possible to detect the transcripts of practically any gene ; Enabled sample amplification and eliminated the need for abundant starting material required when using northern blot analysis ; Provided tolerance for RNA degradation as long as the RNA spanning the primer is intact In RT-PCR, the RNA template is first converted into a complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse transcriptase (RT). The cDNA is then used as a template for exponential amplification using PCR. The use of RT-PCR for the detection of RNA transcript has revolutionized the study of gene expression in the following important ways:

  Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. An example of a retrovirus is HIV. Reverse transcriptase is commonly employed in amplification of RNA for research purposes. Using an RNA template, PCR can utilize reverse transcriptase, creating a DNA template. This new DNA template can then be used for typical PCR amplification. The products of such an experiment are thus amplified PCR products from RNA. Each HIV retrovirus particle contains two RNA genomes, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus. After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination). From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

  Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings. The close association between RT-PCR and qPCR has led to metonymic use of the term qPCR to mean RT-PCR. Such use may be confusing, as RT-PCR can be used without qPCR, for example to enable molecular cloning, sequencing or simple detection of RNA. Conversely, qPCR may be used without RT-PCR, for example to quantify the copy number of a specific piece of DNA.

  In biotechnology applications, T7 RNA polymerase is commonly used to transcribe DNA that has been cloned into vectors that have two (different) phage promoters (e.g., T7 and T3, or T7 and SP6) in opposite orientation. RNA can be selectively synthesized from either strand of the insert DNA with the different polymerases. The enzyme is stimulated by spermidine and in vitro activity is increased by the presence of carrier proteins (such as BSA) Homogeneously labeled single-stranded RNA can be generated with this system. Transcripts can be non-radioactively labeled to high specific activity with certain labeled nucleotides.

 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).

In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977).  These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

Structure 

The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

Replication fidelity 

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

Template switching

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus.  After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination).  There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle.  Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

Applications

Antiviral drugs 

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

Molecular biology 

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

Reverse transcriptase has also been employed in insulin production. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Large amounts of insulin can then be created, sidestepping the need to harvest pig pancreas and other such traditional sources. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Processing in the eukaryotic cell during mRNA production removes these introns to provide a suitable template. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.

A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).

In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977).  These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

Structure 

The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

Replication fidelity 

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

Template switching

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus.  After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination).  There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle.  Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

Applications

Antiviral drugs 

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

Molecular biology 

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

Reverse transcriptase has also been employed in insulin production. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Large amounts of insulin can then be created, sidestepping the need to harvest pig pancreas and other such traditional sources. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Processing in the eukaryotic cell during mRNA production removes these introns to provide a suitable template. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.

 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

  Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to molecular cloning and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 1 1.61295 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible. Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis. History Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco). Well-studied reverse transcriptases include: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas. M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer. AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit. Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes. Function in viruses The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate. Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template. In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template. The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance. Retroviral reverse transcription Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps: Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS. Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA. A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA. The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA. The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended. The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence. Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer. The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand. Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase. Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity. Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’ direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed. The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). In cellular life Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication. Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977). These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication. Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role. Structure The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand. Replication fidelity There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps. Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV. Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several

The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps. Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV. Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts.

 5 1.61295 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible. Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis. History Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco). Well-studied reverse transcriptases include: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas. M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer. AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit. Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes. Function in viruses The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate. Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template. In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template. The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance. Retroviral reverse transcription Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps: Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS. Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA. A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA. The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA. The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended. The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence. Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer. The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand. Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase. Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity. Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’ direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed. The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). In cellular life Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication. Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977). These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication. Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role. Structure The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template. In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template. Retroviral reverse transcription Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps: Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS. Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA. The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase. Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed. The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). In cellular life Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication. Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977). Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes.

['The Hardy-Weinberg law is a fundamental principle in population genetics that describes the equilibrium frequencies of alleles in a population. It assumes that a population is large, randomly mating, and has no mutation, gene flow, or natural selection. However, in reality, these assumptions are rarely met in natural populations.\n\nIn order for the Hardy-Weinberg law to operate with respect to a population of organisms, each of the following conditions must be met EXCEPT:\n\n1. Large population size: The population size must be large enough to ensure that genetic drift does not significantly alter allele frequencies. A population size of 10,000 or more is typically considered large enough for this purpose.\n\n2. Random mating: Mating must occur randomly, with no preference for certain genotypes or alleles. This ensures that all possible genotypes are represented in the population.\n\n3. No mutation: Mutation is the process by which new alleles are introduced into a population.

  Population genetics describes the genetic composition of a population, including allele frequencies, and how allele frequencies are expected to change over time. The Hardy–Weinberg law describes the expected equilibrium genotype frequencies in a diploid population after random mating. Random mating alone does not change allele frequencies, and the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assumes an infinite population size and a selectively neutral locus. In natural populations natural selection (adaptation mechanism), gene flow, and mutation combine to change allele frequencies across generations. Genetic drift causes changes in allele frequency from random sampling due to offspring number variance in a finite population size, with small populations experiencing larger per generation fluctuations in frequency than large populations. There is also a theory that second adaptation mechanism exists –

 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that describes the distribution of alleles in a non-evolving population. It provides a mathematical model to estimate the frequency of different genotypes and alleles in a population. The law states that in the absence of certain factors, such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, migration, and non-random mating, the frequency of alleles in a population will remain constant from generation to generation. 

By excluding natural selection as an option, we understand that the Hardy Weinberg law indicates that the relative frequency of different alleles within a population will remain constant over time, as long as no other factors that influence gene frequencies are present. This equilibrium implies that the population is not evolving and serves as a useful null hypothesis for studying genetic variation in natural populations. However, in reality, natural selection is an important factor that can cause changes in allele frequencies, leading to evolution over time.

It is worth noting that the Hardy-Weinberg law assumes an idealized population with certain conditions, such as a large population size, random mating, absence of mutation, migration, and selection. In real-world populations, these assumptions may not hold true, and deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can indicate the presence of evolutionary forces at work. Therefore, the law serves as a valuable tool for studying populations and understanding how genetic variation can change over time.

 The law that states that the relative frequency of each gene allele tends to remain constant from generation to generation is known as the Hardy-Weinberg law. This principle describes the genetic equilibrium in a population under certain conditions. According to the Hardy-Weinberg law, the allele frequencies in a population will remain stable if certain assumptions are met. These assumptions include a large population size, random mating, no migration, no mutation, and no natural selection. When these conditions are satisfied, the law predicts that the gene pool of a population will remain constant over time, with no changes in allele frequencies. However, any deviation from these assumptions can lead to changes in the gene pool, resulting in genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, or natural selection. It is important to note that while the Hardy-Weinberg law provides a theoretical framework, real populations often do not perfectly conform to these assumptions.

In a diploid population there are three possible genotypes, two homozygous genotypes (AA and BB), and one heterozygous genotype (AB). If we sample 10 individuals from the population, and we observe the genotype frequencies then there are of the B allele, out of 20 total chromosome copies. The frequency p of the A allele is p = 15/20 = 0.75, and the frequency q of the B allele is q = 5/20 = 0.25.

 Factors that affect the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law include random mating, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and natural selection. Random mating refers to the idea that individuals in a population choose their mates without any bias towards specific traits. This ensures that all genotypes have an equal chance of being passed on to the next generation. 

Genetic drift, on the other hand, refers to the random changes in allele frequencies that can occur in small populations due to chance events. This can lead to deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

Gene flow occurs when individuals migrate between different populations, introducing new alleles or removing existing ones. This can disrupt the equilibrium if the migrating individuals have different allele frequencies than the recipient population. 

Mutation is another factor that can alter allele frequencies. Mutations create new genetic variations, which can change the gene pool of a population and affect the equilibrium. 

Finally, natural selection is the process by which certain traits are favored or disfavored in a population. If certain genotypes have a higher fitness than others, they will be selected for and their frequencies will increase, disrupting the equilibrium. 

Overall, these factors can individually or collectively influence the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law, highlighting the dynamic nature of genetic populations.

  If If there are more than two different allelic forms, the frequency for each allele is simply the frequency of its homozygote plus half the sum of the frequencies for all the heterozygotes in which it appears. (For 3 alleles see ) Allele frequency can always be calculated from genotype frequency, whereas the reverse requires that the Hardy–Weinberg conditions of random mating apply.

  The Hardy–Weinberg principle states that under certain idealised conditions, including the absence of selection pressures, a large population will have no change in the frequency of alleles as generations pass. A population that satisfies these conditions is said to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. In particular, Hardy and Weinberg showed that dominant and recessive alleles do not automatically tend to become more and less frequent respectively, as had been thought previously. The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include that there must be no mutations, immigration, or emigration, all of which can directly change allelic frequencies. Additionally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles. A population that is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is analogous to a deck of cards; no matter how many times the deck is shuffled, no new cards are added and no old ones are taken away. Cards in the deck represent alleles in a population's gene pool. In practice, no population can be in perfect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The population's finite size, combined with natural selection and many other effects, cause the allelic frequencies to change over time.

 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that is related to the study of gene frequencies within populations. It provides a mathematical model for predicting the frequencies of alleles in a population from one generation to the next, assuming certain conditions are met. These conditions include a large population size, random mating, no mutations, no migration, and no natural selection.

The Hardy-Weinberg law allows scientists to make predictions about how genetic traits are inherited and how they may change over time within a population. By understanding the frequencies of alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of genetic diversity and evolution. This law is particularly useful in studying traits that are influenced by a single gene locus with two alleles, such as blood type or certain genetic disorders.

In summary, the Hardy-Weinberg law is a fundamental principle in population genetics that helps scientists understand how gene frequencies can remain stable or change within populations over generations. By studying this law, researchers can gain valuable insights into genetic diversity, inheritance patterns, and evolutionary processes.

 2 -5.76563 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that describes the distribution of alleles in a non-evolving population. It provides a mathematical model to estimate the frequency of different genotypes and alleles in a population. The law states that in the absence of certain factors, such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, migration, and non-random mating, the frequency of alleles in a population will remain constant from generation to generation. 

By excluding natural selection as an option, we understand that the Hardy Weinberg law indicates that the relative frequency of different alleles within a population will remain constant over time, as long as no other factors that influence gene frequencies are present. This equilibrium implies that the population is not evolving and serves as a useful null hypothesis for studying genetic variation in natural populations. However, in reality, natural selection is an important factor that can cause changes in allele frequencies, leading to evolution over time.

It is worth noting that the Hardy-Weinberg law assumes an idealized population with certain conditions, such as a large population size, random mating, absence of mutation, migration, and selection. In real-world populations, these assumptions may not hold true, and deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can indicate the presence of evolutionary forces at work. Therefore, the law serves as a valuable tool for studying populations and understanding how genetic variation can change over time.
 3 -6.09833 Factors that affect the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law include random mating, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and natural selection. Random mating refers to the idea that individuals in a population choose their mates without any bias towards specific traits. This ensures that all genotypes have an equal chance of being passed on to the next generation. 

Genetic drift, on the other hand, refers to the random changes in allele frequencies that can occur in small populations due to chance events. This can lead to deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

Gene flow occurs when individuals migrate between different populations, introducing new alleles or removing existing ones. This can disrupt the equilibrium if the migrating individuals have different allele frequencies than the recipient population. 

Mutation is another factor that can alter allele frequencies. Mutations create new genetic variations, which can change the gene pool of a population and affect the equilibrium. 

Finally, natural selection is the process by which certain traits are favored or disfavored in a population. If certain genotypes have a higher fitness than others, they will be selected for and their frequencies will increase, disrupting the equilibrium. 

Overall, these factors can individually or collectively influence the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law, highlighting the dynamic nature of genetic populations.

['The Barr body is a heterochromatin structure found in the nuclei of female mammalian cells. It is formed by the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in females, which results in the condensation of the chromatin into a compact, inactive structure. This inactivation is known as X-chromosome inactivation or lyonization, and it occurs randomly in each cell during early embryonic development. The Barr body is named after the British embryologist, Dr. Murray Barr, who first described it in 1941.\n\nThe Barr body is typically visible as a dark, dense mass near the nucleolus, which is a structure within the nucleus that is involved in ribosome synthesis. The Barr body is composed of highly condensed chromatin, which is characterized by the presence of histone proteins and the absence of transcription factors. This condensed chromatin structure is resistant to transcription, which means that the genes on the inactive X chromosome are not being transcribed into RNA.\n\nThe formation of the Barr body is a complex process that involves the recruitment of various proteins and modifications to the chromatin. One of the key proteins involved in this process is the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), which is a long non-coding RNA molecule that is transcribed from the X-inactive', "The Barr body found within female mammalian cells' nuclei is an example ofThe Barr body found within female mammalian cells' nuclei is an example of\nA. euchromatin\nB. heterochromatin\nC. a cistron\nD. pseudogenes"]

  X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies. Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called

  of the X chromosome to be "doubled," or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes. The second dosage compensation that occurs in mammals are the balancing of X’s and autosomes. This regulation occurs by the upregulation of Xa, which is the active X. The upregulation of the active X shows increases in the activation of transcription and elongation. The X chromosome, compared to an autosomal gene, contains more silent genes which influences measuring the amount of influence active genes have. RNA-seq data was preformed and the autosomal and X linked gene outputs were significantly different. This agrees with the fact that X dosage

In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the male-specific lethal (msl) gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The msl gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the msl gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the

  A major function of H-NS is to influence DNA topology (Figure 2). H-NS is responsible for formation of nucleofilaments along the DNA and DNA-DNA bridges. H-NS is known as a passive DNA bridger, meaning that it binds two distant segments of DNA and remains stationary, forming a loop. This DNA loop formation allows H-NS to control gene expression. Relief of suppression by H-NS can be achieved by the binding of another protein, or by changes in DNA topology which can occur due to changes in temperature and osmolarity, for example. The CTD binds to the bacterial in such a way that inhibits the function of RNA polymerase. This is a common feature seen in horizontally acquired genes. Structural studies of H-NS

During mitosis, gene transcription is silenced and most transcription factors are removed from chromatin. The term bookmarking compares transcription to reading from a book.

  H-NS has a specific topology that allows it to condense bacterial DNA into a superhelical structure based on evidence from X-ray crystallography. The condensed superhelical structure has implicated H-NS in gene repression caused by the formation of oligomers. These oligomers form due to dimerization of two sites in the N-terminal domain of H-NS. For example, in bacterial species like Salmonella typhimurium, the NTD of H-NS contains dimerization sites in helices alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3. Alpha helices 3 and 4 are then responsible for creating the superhelical structure of H-NS-DNA interactions by head to head association (Figure 2). H-NS also contains an unstructured linker region, also known as a Q-linker. The C-Terminal domain, also known as the DNA Binding Domain (DBD), shows high affinity for regions in DNA that are rich in

 One epigenetic mechanism that contributes to the silencing of one X chromosome in females is DNA methylation. The inactive X chromosome is highly methylated, meaning that methyl groups are added to specific regions of the DNA. This methylation leads to gene silencing by preventing transcription factors and other regulatory proteins from accessing the DNA and initiating transcription. In addition to DNA methylation, another epigenetic mechanism involved in X chromosome inactivation is histone modification. Histones are proteins that help package and organize DNA within the nucleus. The inactive X chromosome has low levels of histone acetylation, which results in a more tightly packed chromatin structure that is less permissive to gene expression. Conversely, active X chromosomes have higher levels of histone acetylation, leading to a more open chromatin configuration that promotes transcription.

The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene plays a crucial role in X chromosome inactivation. It encodes a large noncoding RNA molecule called Xist RNA, which coats the X chromosome from which it is transcribed. This coating helps initiate and maintain the silencing of the X chromosome. Additionally, noncoding RNAs that bind to DNA can also impact transcriptional activity and contribute to the silencing process.

It is important to note that X chromosome inactivation occurs randomly in each cell during development, meaning that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome can be inactivated. Once a particular X chromosome is inactivated, it remains inactive and this information is passed on to future generations of cells.

Overall, these epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the involvement of Xist RNA, contribute to the silencing of one X chromosome in females as part of the X chromosome inactivation process.

[Reference: The inactive X chromosome is highly methylated and has low levels of histone acetylation. The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene encodes a large noncoding RNA that mediates the silencing of the X chromosome from which it is transcribed by coating it with Xist RNA. CpG islands in promoter regions are typically unmethylated, and the lack of methylation facilitates transcription. Histone methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to lysine residues in histone proteins. Acetylation of histone proteins results in an open chromatin configuration, which favors active transcription. Other histone modifications and noncoding RNAs also play roles in transcriptional regulation.]

 The form of RNA that is most likely to play a role in Barr body formation, which is an inactivated X chromosome, is long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNAs have been implicated in the process of X chromosome inactivation, which is responsible for the formation of Barr bodies. These noncoding RNA molecules are transcribed from the Xist gene on the X chromosome that will be inactivated.

During X chromosome inactivation, the Xist lncRNA coats the future inactive X chromosome and recruits proteins involved in gene silencing. This coating leads to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally inactive structure, known as the Barr body. The Xist lncRNA plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of X chromosome inactivation, ensuring gene dosage compensation between males and females.

By studying the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation and the involvement of lncRNAs like Xist, researchers have gained insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and the role of noncoding RNAs in developmental processes.

 F body refers to the Y chromatin, which is a characteristic feature of the interphase nuclei of normal cells in individuals with male chromosomal complement. It is named after the French cytologist, Alfred J. F. Fourtier, who first described this phenomenon. The F body represents the condensed, heterochromatic inactive portion of the Y chromosome. 

The Y chromosome is found in males and is responsible for male sexual development. It contains genes that code for the development of male characteristics and fertility. In interphase nuclei, the Y chromosome can appear as a dark, dense body called the F body or Barr body. This condensed form of the Y chromosome is inactive and has a different appearance compared to the active X chromosome found in females.

The formation of the F body is due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation, which balances the gene expression between males and females. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to achieve dosage compensation. This inactivation process results in the formation of the Barr body, which is analogous to the F body in males.

It is important to note that the F body is a term specific to the Y chromosome in males, whereas the Barr body is specific to the X chromosome in females. These structures play a role in regulating gene expression and preserving the stability of the genome.

  A pronucleus (plural: pronuclei) is the nucleus of a sperm or an egg cell during the process of fertilization. The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse. Contrary to the sperm cell, the egg cell has a pronucleus once it becomes haploid, and not when the sperm cell arrives. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells, so in humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes, while somatic cells have 46 chromosomes. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead,

The condensed superhelical structure has implicated H-NS in gene repression caused by the formation of oligomers. These oligomers form due to dimerization of two sites in the N-terminal domain of H-NS. For example, in bacterial species like Salmonella typhimurium, the NTD of H-NS contains dimerization sites in helices alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3. Alpha helices 3 and 4 are then responsible for creating the superhelical structure of H-NS-DNA interactions by head to head association (Figure 2).

["Carbon is a crucial element in the Earth's atmosphere, and its concentration has been steadily increasing over the past century due to human activities. The primary source of atmospheric carbon is the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air. This process is known as anthropogenic carbon emissions, and it is the leading cause of global warming.\n\nHowever, there are other sources of atmospheric carbon as well. Respiration, for example, is a natural process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is because when we breathe, we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Similarly, photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide into organic matter, also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nBacterial decomposition is another natural process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This occurs when organic matter, such as dead plants and animals, is broken down by bacteria. The process of bacterial decomposition releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nIn contrast, bacterial decomposition is not a significant source of atmospheric carbon. This is because the amount of carbon released through bacterial decomposition is relatively small compared to the amount released through other processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while respiration, photosynthesis, and bacterial decomposition", 'Which of the following is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon?Which of the following is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon?\nA.

  the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for. Natural processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 29% of annual global emissions. The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted.

  The Earth absorbs sunlight, then radiates it as heat. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit infrared radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence. While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as (~20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore

  oxide, and 3% was fluorinated gases. emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity. Additional emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the  released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser. Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of inorganic and organic fertiliser. From a production standpoint, the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%).

  Aerosols are one of the most important contributors to climate change in the atmosphere. Many of the particles suspended in the atmosphere originate from a multitude of sources. Some of these sources are natural and some of them are man-made. Most aerosols reflect sunlight, and some also absorb it. A lot of these nanoparticles cause severe health effects in addition to climate effects. There are many human activities that produce these particles. Black carbon particles (a component of soot) originating from combustion processes have been known for some time to absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere, and pollution controls have been put into place to reduce their emissions and their effects. Brown carbon has attracted interest as a possible cause of climate change. This class of organic carbon, known for its brownish color, absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet wavelengths and less significantly going into the visible wavelengths. Types of brown carbon include tar materials from smoldering fires or coal combustion, breakdown products from biomass burning, a mixture of organic compounds emitted from soil, and volatile organic compounds given off by vegetation.

  Carbon rift is a result of CO2 gas being released into the environment by human sources, with the theory focusing specifically on capitalistic ones. In 2014, fossil fuel consumption resulted in nearly 36 billion metric tons of CO2 finding its way into natural sinks such as the atmosphere, land, and oceans. This transfer of carbon from the burning of fossil fuels into the biosphere is the primary human-driven cause of greenhouse gas emissions and is closely related to the unchecked behavior of capitalism.

  Petroleum extraction disrupts the equilibrium of earth's carbon cycle by transporting sequestered geologic carbon into the biosphere. The carbon is used by consumers in various forms and a large fraction is combusted into the atmosphere; thus creating massive amounts of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as a waste product. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. Since the industrial age began circa 1750–1850 with growing wood and coal use, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane have increased about 50% and 150%, respectively, above their relatively stable levels of the prior 800,000+ years. Each is currently increasing at a rate of about 1% every year, since about half of the added carbon has been absorbed by Earth's land vegetation and ocean sinks. The growth in annual emissions has also been so rapid that the total amount of fossil carbon extracted in the last 30 years exceeds the total amount extracted during all prior human history.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35% during the Carboniferous period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen and the breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.

 The sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include various natural and human activities. One major source is the respiration of all animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. During respiration, these organisms produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Additionally, plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create sugars, which can be used for plant growth or consumed again in respiration.

Another significant source of carbon dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels and vegetable matter. When these substances are burned, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This includes activities such as burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production or transportation.

Inorganic carbon dioxide is also emitted by geothermal processes like volcanoes and hot springs. These natural occurrences release carbon dioxide from within the Earth's crust.

It's important to note that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its ability to absorb infrared radiation makes it an important component in regulating Earth's temperature.

Overall, the sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include both natural processes like respiration and volcanic activity, as well as human activities such as burning fossil fuels. These sources contribute to the overall concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

 The greatest contributor to global warming as a consequence of human activities and lifestyle is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that occurs naturally in the Earth's atmosphere, but human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have significantly increased its concentration. Carbon dioxide acts as a blanket in the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon is one of the primary causes of global warming.

Burning fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production and transportation is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. These activities release vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, contributing to the overall greenhouse gas concentration. Deforestation also plays a significant role in carbon dioxide emissions. Trees and plants absorb CO2 as part of the natural carbon cycle, but when forests are cleared or burned, stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere.

Moreover, industrial processes such as cement production, chemical manufacturing, and the extraction of metals also release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For example, cement production emits CO2 both from the combustion of fossil fuels and from chemical reactions during the manufacturing process.

Reducing carbon dioxide emissions is crucial in mitigating the effects of global warming. Implementing sustainable practices, transitioning to renewable sources of energy, and promoting reforestation efforts are important steps that can help lessen our carbon footprint and work towards a more sustainable future.

['Punctuated equilibrium is a theory in evolutionary biology that proposes that most species evolve relatively rapidly through periods of rapid change, or "punctuations," separated by long periods of relative stasis, or "equilibrium." This theory challenges the traditional Darwinian view of gradualism, which suggests that evolution occurs through small, incremental changes over long periods of time.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibrium was first proposed by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in the 1970s. They argued that the fossil record shows evidence of sudden, dramatic changes in species, followed by long periods of relative stability. These sudden changes, or "punctuations," are thought to be caused by environmental factors, such as catastrophic events or changes in climate.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibrium has been supported by a number of studies, particularly in the field of paleontology. For example, a study of fossils from the Burgess Shale in Canada found that many species appeared suddenly in the fossil record, followed by long periods of relative stasis.\n\nHowever, the theory has also been criticized by some scientists, who argue that it is not supported by all lines of evidence. For example, some studies have found evidence of gradual evolution in certain species, rather than sudden, dramatic changes.\n\nOverall, the theory of punctuated equilibrium remains a topic of debate and ongoing research in the', 'The concept of punctuated equilibrium refers toThe concept of punctuated equilibrium refers to\nA. oscillating ecological successional stages\nB. ecological succession arrested by sudden environmental changes, e.g., fire\nC. persistent predator-prey relationships in relatively stable environments\nD. bursts of speciation followed by relatively unchanging lineages']

  species. The theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over

 Punctuated gradualism is a hypothesis in the field of microevolution that describes a pattern of evolution where a species experiences long periods of relative stability, or stasis, followed by shorter periods of rapid morphological change. This model suggests that evolutionary changes occur in bursts rather than as a constant and gradual process.

In punctuated gradualism, species exhibit little to no change over extended periods of time, which is known as stasis. However, during certain intervals, relatively rapid morphological changes occur without leading to the formation of new lineages or branching. These bursts of change are often associated with environmental pressures or other factors that drive adaptation within a population.

This model differs from other models of evolution, such as phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. Phyletic gradualism proposes that evolutionary change occurs gradually and continuously over long periods, resulting in the transformation of one species into another. In contrast, punctuated gradualism suggests that most evolutionary change happens during short bursts rather than being continuous.

Punctuated equilibrium, on the other hand, also acknowledges periods of stasis but emphasizes that speciation events can occur relatively rapidly after prolonged stability. Punctuated equilibrium proposes that species remain relatively unchanged for extended periods and then experience sudden bursts of rapid evolution leading to the formation of new lineages.

Overall, punctuated gradualism highlights the idea that evolution can involve long periods of stability interrupted by episodes of rapid morphological change within existing lineages. It provides an alternative perspective to phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium in understanding patterns and rates of evolutionary change.

  Darwin and his contemporaries viewed evolution as a slow and gradual process. Evolutionary trees are based on the idea that profound differences in species are the result of many small changes that accumulate over long periods. Gradualism had its basis in the works of the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell. Hutton's view suggests that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to catastrophism which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s palaeontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years) alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called punctuated equilibrium and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.

 Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."Darwin thought that the lack of fossil evidence for gradualism was due to the low likelihood that the intermediate steps in such transitions would have been preserved. **Figure 19.2** Origins of vertebrate physiologic homologies.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leptin, adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) and β‐adrenergic receptor (βAR) share homologies with the fat pad free fatty acid (FFA) regulation. The lung and kidney share functional homologies through PTHrP and type IV collagen ("Goodpasture"). Periods of hypoxia due to shortfalls in the saltatory process of lung evolution caused physiologic stress, stimulating the pituitary‐adrenal axis production of adrenaline (epinephrine), which both relieved the constraint on the alveoli stimulating surfactant secretion, and stimulated peripheral fat cell secretion of FFAs, causing increased metabolic activity and body heat = endothermy. Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."This slow pace is "punctuated" by rapid bursts of change resulting in new species.According to this theory, changes leading to new species do not result from slow, incremental changes in the mainstream population.Instead, changes occur in populations living on the periphery, or in isolated populations where their gene pools vary more widely due to slightly different environmental conditions.

  Many scientists and philosophers of science have described evolution as fact and theory, a phrase which was used as the title of an article by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in 1981. He describes fact in science as meaning data, not known with absolute certainty but "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent". A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of evolution come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical common descent, and from transitions in the fossil record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts. Each of the words evolution, fact and theory has several meanings in different contexts. In biology, evolution refers to observed changes in organisms over successive generations, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in gene

 The main differences between the traditional phylogenetic model of paleontology and the punctuated equilibrium model lie in their views on the pace and nature of evolution. The phylogenetic model suggests that features evolve slowly over time without any direct association with speciation events. This means that changes in species occur gradually and continuously.

On the other hand, the punctuated equilibrium model proposes that major evolutionary changes do not happen gradually but rather in localized, rare, and rapid events of branching speciation. According to this model, species remain relatively stable for long periods of time (equilibrium), with little change occurring. However, when change does occur, it happens rapidly and results in new branches or species forming.

Punctuated gradualism is a variation within this framework, lying somewhere between the phyletic gradualism model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It suggests that lineages can undergo rapid transitions between long-stable states without necessarily requiring speciation events. In other words, significant evolutionary changes can occur without the formation of new species.

It's important to note that while these models provide different perspectives on how evolution occurs, they are not mutually exclusive. They represent different ways of understanding patterns of evolutionary change over time.

  In ecology, the theory of alternative stable states (sometimes termed alternate stable states or alternative stable equilibria) predicts that ecosystems can exist under multiple "states" (sets of unique biotic and abiotic conditions). These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a phase shift or regime shift), when perturbed. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. Alternative stable state theory suggests that discrete states are separated by ecological thresholds, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an environmental gradient.

  split into two or more reproductively isolated groups and these groups accumulate sufficient differences to become distinct species. The punctuated equilibria hypothesis suggests that anagenesis is rare and that the rate of evolution is most rapid immediately after a split which will lead to cladogenesis, but does not completely rule out anagenesis. Distinguishing between anagenesis and cladogenesis is particularly relevant in the fossil record, where limited fossil preservation in time and space makes it difficult to distinguish between anagenesis, cladogenesis where one species replaces the other, or simple migration patterns. Recent evolutionary studies are looking at anagenesis and cladogeneis for possible answers in developing the hominin phylogenetic tree

  In the natural sciences, gradualism is the theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with catastrophism. The theory was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton, a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into Charles Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism. Tenets from both theories were applied to biology and formed the basis of early evolutionary theory. Charles Darwin was influenced by Lyell's Principles of Geology, which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see catastrophism), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in saltations, since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against. Gradualism is often confused with the concept of phyletic gradualism. It is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium, which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.

  Influenza A is involved in most strains of the flu. It is an enveloped RNA virus. It has a protein membrane containing the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which are used by the virus to enter a host cell and to release itself and its copies from the host cell. Each strain of the influenza virus has a different pattern of glycoproteins; the glycoproteins themselves have variability as well.

Reassortment is a process that happens if two different types of influenza virus infect a single cell and it can produce a new strain of influenza. This is because the virus genome is split between eight independent pieces of RNA, which allows pieces of RNA from different viruses to mix and form a novel type of virus as new virus particles are being assembled. This new strain appears to be a result of the reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, one from North America and one from Europe. But the North

  Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by transfection. This is often performed to cause cells to express a gene of interest. More recently, the transfection of RNAi constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as transduction, infection or transformation. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

  There are two ways viruses can enter the host cell: cell receptor endocytosis or fusion. Endocytosis is the process where the virus binds a receptor on the target cell membrane, and the virus is taken into or endocytosed into the cell. Endocytosis can either be pH independent or pH dependent. Fusion occurs when the virus fuses together with the target cell membrane and releases its genome into the cell. RSV enters the host cell through fusion of the host cell membrane.

 Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and M2 protein in the influenza virus ; gp160, composed of subunits gp120 and gp41, in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The capsid of some viruses are enclosed in a membrane called the viral envelope. In most cases, the viral envelope is obtained by the capsid from the host cell's plasma membrane when a virus leaves its host cell through a process called budding. The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer embedded with viral proteins, including viral glycoproteins. These viral glycoproteins bind to specific receptors and coreceptors on the membrane of host cells, and they allow viruses to attach onto their target host cells. Some of these glycoproteins include: Viral glycoproteins play a critical role in virus-to-cell fusion. Virus-to-cell fusion is initiated when viral glycoproteins bind to cellular receptors.

 Viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the cellular machinery of the host. They are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on the host cell's ability to replicate genetic information and synthesize proteins.

When a virus infects a host cell, it delivers its genetic material (DNA or RNA) into the host cell's cytoplasm. The viral genetic material then takes control of the host cell's protein synthesis machinery, redirecting it to produce viral proteins instead of the cell's own proteins.

The viral genetic material is also replicated within the host cell. For DNA viruses, the viral DNA is replicated using the host cell's DNA replication machinery. For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is usually first converted into DNA using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (in the case of retroviruses) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (in the case of RNA viruses). This viral DNA (or RNA in the case of RNA viruses) is then replicated using the host cell's replication machinery.

Once the viral genetic material has been replicated, the newly synthesized viral proteins and nucleic acids assemble to form new virus particles. These virus particles then leave the host cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by causing the cell to rupture (lysis), allowing the released viruses to infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of infection.

In summary, viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the host cell's machinery for protein synthesis and genetic replication. This allows them to produce new viral particles, which can then infect other cells.

 In the replication cycle of the virus causing the symptoms in the patient, a crucial step known as reverse transcription occurs, where viral RNA is converted into DNA. This process is carried out by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is unique to retroviruses. Reverse transcription is a vital step because it allows the virus to integrate into the host's genetic material and manipulate the host cell's machinery to produce more copies of the virus.

Once the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, it forms a structure known as a provirus. The provirus can be integrated into the host cell's genome, allowing it to be passed on to future generations of cells. This integration is facilitated by another enzyme called integrase. By incorporating its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, the virus ensures its long-term survival and persistence within the host's body.

After integration, the host cell's machinery starts producing viral proteins and genetic material using the viral DNA. These components assemble to form new viral particles. Eventually, the newly synthesized viruses are released from the infected cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by the host cell rupturing (lysis). These released viruses can then go on to infect other cells and continue the replication cycle.

It's important to note that different viruses may have varying replication cycles and strategies. The one described here is specific to retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which utilize reverse transcription to convert their RNA into DNA. By understanding the intricacies of the replication cycle, researchers can develop targeted approaches for antiviral therapies to disrupt key steps and impede viral replication.

  Viral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the rolling-hairpin model.

  Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to molecular cloning and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 In the replication of a virus, there are two main components involved: the virus itself and the host cell. The virus provides the genetic code necessary for replication, while the host cell provides the energy and raw materials required for the process.

A virus is composed of a core of genetic material, either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid), surrounded by a protein coat called an antigenic protein. Some viruses may also have an additional envelope made of lipoprotein. The genetic material of the virus contains all the information needed to make copies of itself.

When a virus infects a host cell, it injects its genetic material into the cell. The genetic material then hijacks the cellular machinery of the host cell to replicate itself. The replication process varies depending on whether the virus has DNA or RNA as its genetic material.

In the case of DNA viruses, the viral DNA becomes integrated into the host cell's DNA, and it uses the host cell's enzymes and resources to replicate its DNA. The host cell's machinery reads the viral DNA and produces new viral DNA strands, which are then packaged into new virus particles.

For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is used directly as a template for the synthesis of new viral RNA strands. The host cell's enzymes and resources are utilized to produce new viral proteins using the viral RNA as a blueprint. These proteins are then assembled with the new viral RNA strands to form new virus particles.

Throughout the replication process, the host cell plays a crucial role by providing the necessary energy and raw materials. The host cell supplies the energy required for cellular processes and provides the building blocks, such as nucleotides and amino acids, for the synthesis of new viral genetic material and proteins. Without the host cell's resources, the virus would not be able to replicate and continue its infectious cycle.

Overall, the replication of a virus involves the virus using the host cell's machinery and resources to generate new viral genetic material and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles. The host cell's role is vital in providing the necessary components for viral replication to occur.

['During the early stages of embryonic development, the process of cell division is critical in determining the overall shape and structure of the organism. In some organisms, the cleavage pattern, or the way in which the cells divide, is symmetrical and follows a specific pattern. This type of cleavage is known as radial cleavage.\n\nRadial cleavage occurs when the first few cell divisions occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis, resulting in a symmetrical pattern of cell division. This type of cleavage is common in animals with bilateral symmetry, such as vertebrates.\n\nIn radial cleavage, the blastula, or the ball of cells that forms during early development, is flattened and disc-shaped. The cells divide in a radial pattern, with each new cell forming a ring around the existing cells. This results in a series of concentric rings, or blastomeres, that surround a central cavity.\n\nThe blastomeres in radial cleavage are not equal in size, as they are in other types of cleavage. The cells in the center of the blastula are smaller than those on the periphery, and the cells in the outermost ring are the largest. This is due to the fact that the cells in the center of the blastula are surrounded by more cells, while the cells on the periphery are surrounded by fewer cells.\n\nRad', 'Cleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis is known asCleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis is known as\nA. meroblastic cleavage\nB. radial cleavage\nC. spiral cleavage\nD. superficial cleavage']

  univalents in both sexes remain between the segregating half-bivalents and form their own third nucleus, which is included in one of the two daughter cells. In female meiosis, this is the daughter cell facing the micropyle. Thus, in agreement with the two plant species discussed previously, the univalents are allocated directionally to the micropylar side. However, since here the embryo sac is formed at the other end of the tetrad facing the chalaza, this results in the elimination of the univalents from the inheritance. The compensation for this is done by the pollen, in that apparently only those pollen grains which arise from the dinucleate meiocytes and are therefore diploid, develop normally and become fertile.

When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the G1 stage of cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome.

  In the life cycle of Elysia chlorotica, cleavage is holoblastic and spiral. This means that the eggs cleave completely (holoblastic); and each cleavage plane is at an oblique angle to the animal-vegetal axis of the egg. The result of this is that tiers of cells are produced, each tier lying in the furrows between cells of the tier below it. At the end of cleavage, the embryo forms a stereoblastula, meaning a blastula without a clear central cavity.

 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules.

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

 1 1.84976 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula. Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole. Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern. Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage. In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere. Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates. In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere. Meroblastic In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage. Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial. Discoidal In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk. The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk. Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end). The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in
 4 1.84976 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula. Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole. Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases. Mechanism The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis. The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus. The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6). Types of cleavage Determinate Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes. It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo. Indeterminate A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism. Holoblastic In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage. In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging. In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms. Bilateral The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves. The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another. In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected. Radial Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte. Rotational Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially. Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed). Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients. The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage. Spiral Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below). This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole.

Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe.

In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6). Types of cleavage Determinate Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism. Holoblastic In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage. In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms. In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected. Radial Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially. Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed). The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage. Spiral Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another.

Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end). When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the G1 stage of cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome.

['The targeting of newly synthesized proteins to their final destinations is a complex process that involves the recognition of specific signal sequences by various components of the cellular machinery. In eukaryotic cells, proteins can be targeted to various cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, lysosomes, cytosol, and chloroplasts.\n\nThe targeting of proteins to the plasma membrane typically involves a single signal peptide, which is cleaved during or after translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This signal peptide is usually located at the N-terminus of the protein and is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the translocon.\n\nIn contrast, the targeting of proteins to lysosomes, cytosol, and chloroplasts often involves the recognition of multiple signal sequences. For example, proteins destined for lysosomes typically contain a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail that contains a lysosomal targeting signal. This signal is typically a di-leucine motif (LL) or a tri-leucine motif (LLL) that is recognized by the adaptor protein complex AP-2.\n\nProteins destined for the cytosol typically do not contain any specific targeting signals', 'Targeting of a newly synthesized protein is most likely to require two different signal peptides for which of the following destinations?Targeting of a newly synthesized protein is most likely to require two different signal peptides for which of the following destinations?\nA.

  The N-terminal signal peptide is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and results in the targeting of the protein to the secretory pathway. In eukaryotic cells, these proteins are synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In prokaryotic cells, the proteins are exported across the cell membrane. In chloroplasts, signal peptides target proteins to the thylakoids.

  The N-terminus is the first part of the protein that exits the ribosome during protein biosynthesis. It often contains signal peptide sequences, "intracellular postal codes" that direct delivery of the protein to the proper organelle. The signal peptide is typically removed at the destination by a signal peptidase. The N-terminal amino acid of a protein is an important determinant of its half-life (likelihood of being degraded). This is called the N-end rule.

  These proteins contain a specific signal-peptide sequence, which is to be translated into the endoplasmic reticulum, but are, however, able to reach the cell surface unconventionally. They can be packed into a COPII-coated vesicle and directly fuse with plasma membrane or can fuse with endosomal or lysosomal compartment. Alternatively, they can be packed into non-COPII-coated vesicle as well and fuse with Golgi (before reaching plasma membrane) or directly delivered to the plasma membrane.

 Newly synthesized organelle proteins find their way from the cytosol to the organelle where they function through a specific pathway guided by sorting signals in their amino acid sequence. These sorting signals, which can be signal sequences or signal patches, are recognized by complementary sorting receptors. The sorting receptors then deliver the proteins to the appropriate target organelle.

In eukaryotic cells, various intracellular membrane-enclosed organelles exist, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endosomes, and peroxisomes. Each organelle has distinct sets of proteins that mediate its unique function. When a new organelle protein is synthesized in the cytosol on a ribosome, it contains sorting signals that dictate its destination.

These sorting signals can be signal sequences or signal patches within the amino acid sequence of the protein. Signal sequences are typically located at the N-terminus of the protein and direct it to specific organelles, such as the ER or mitochondria. Signal patches, on the other hand, are typically located within the folded protein and can guide the protein to other organelles, such as the nucleus or peroxisomes.

Once the sorting signals are recognized by complementary sorting receptors, the protein is then delivered to the appropriate target organelle. The sorting receptors bind to the sorting signals and facilitate the transport of the protein to the organelle membrane. From there, the protein can either be translocated across the membrane or taken up by vesicles that bud off from the organelle.

It is important to note that proteins that function in the cytosol do not contain sorting signals and therefore remain in the cytosol after synthesis. Additionally, during cell division, organelles like the ER and mitochondria are distributed to each daughter cell, as they contain information required for their construction and cannot be made de novo.

In summary, the transportation of newly synthesized organelle proteins from the cytosol to the organelle where they function involves the recognition of sorting signals by sorting receptors. These sorting signals can be signal sequences or signal patches within the amino acid sequence of the protein. Through this process, proteins are directed to their appropriate target organelles and contribute to the proper functioning of cellular processes.

 The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex that plays a crucial role in targeting specific proteins to their correct destinations within the cell. In eukaryotes, such as humans, SRP recognizes and binds to the N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences of newly synthesized proteins as they emerge from the ribosome. This interaction leads to the slowing of protein synthesis, a process known as "elongation arrest," allowing for the coordination of protein translation and translocation.

Upon binding to the signal sequence, SRP targets the entire ribosome-nascent chain complex to the protein-conducting channel, also known as the translocon, located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This targeting is achieved through the interaction and docking of SRP with its cognate SRP receptor, which is in close proximity to the translocon.

In eukaryotes, there are three domains involved in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis that facilitate the successful targeting of SRP to the SRP receptor. These domains are present in the SRP receptor subunits (SRα and SRβ) and the SRP protein SRP54.

Once the ribosome-nascent chain complex is docked at the translocon, the nascent peptide chain is inserted into the translocon channel and enters the ER. At this point, SRP is released from the ribosome and protein synthesis resumes. The SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates through GTP hydrolysis, allowing the cycle of SRP-mediated protein translocation to continue.

Overall, the function of the signal recognition particle is to recognize and target proteins to specific cellular locations, such as the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. By facilitating the translocation of proteins, SRP plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper localization and function of various proteins within the cell.

 A signal peptide plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by guiding the newly synthesized protein to its intended destination within the cell. It is an amino acid sequence located at the amino terminus of a secreted protein. The signal peptide acts as a targeting signal, facilitating the proper trafficking and localization of the protein to specific cellular compartments or the cell membrane.

During protein synthesis, the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome and interacts with signal recognition particles (SRPs). The SRPs recognize the signal peptide and temporarily pause protein synthesis. This pause allows the ribosome with the nascent protein to bind to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where the protein will be translocated.

The signal peptide interacts with a translocation machinery on the ER membrane known as the translocon. This machinery facilitates the transport of the protein across the ER membrane. Once the protein is translocated into the ER, the signal peptide is typically cleaved off by signal peptidases. This cleavage step completes the process of protein targeting and ensures the protein functions correctly in its designated compartment.

In summary, the signal peptide acts as a molecular "zip code" that guides proteins to specific cellular locations during protein synthesis. It is essential for proper protein trafficking, localization, and functionality within the cell.

 SRP (signal recognition particle) plays a crucial role in facilitating the protein translocation process by recognizing and targeting specific proteins to their respective destinations, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. When a protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence emerges from the ribosome during translation, SRP binds to this signal sequence, leading to a slowdown in protein synthesis known as "elongation arrest." This process is conserved and enables the coupling of protein translation and translocation.

Once SRP binds to the signal sequence, it targets the entire ribosome-nascent chain complex to the protein-conducting channel, also known as the translocon, in the ER membrane. This targeting is achieved through the interaction and docking of SRP with its cognate SRP receptor, which is located close to the translocon.

The successful targeting of SRP to the SRP receptor requires the coordinated binding of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) by both SRP and the SRP receptor. In eukaryotes, there are three domains involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis: two in the SRP receptor subunits (SRα and SRβ) and one in the SRP protein (SRP54 or Ffh in bacteria).

Once the ribosome-nascent chain complex docks with the translocon, the nascent peptide chain is inserted into the translocon channel and enters the ER. At this point, SRP is released from the ribosome, and protein synthesis resumes. The complex between SRP and the SRP receptor dissociates through GTP hydrolysis, allowing the cycle of SRP-mediated protein translocation to continue.

It is important to note that the translocation process does not end with SRP's facilitation of targeting to the translocon. Once inside the ER, the signal sequence is typically cleaved, and further chaperones and enzymes assist in guiding the protein's folding, assembly, and eventual transport to its final destination within the cell.

The insulin receptor system, in contrast, appears to diminish the efficacy of endosomal signaling. The epidermal growth factor receptor system, as such, has been used as an intermediate example. Some signals are produced from the actual cell surface in this case but other signals seem to emanate from within the endosomes. This variety of function may be a means to create ligand-specific signals. This supports the notion that trafficking, a term for the modification of proteins subsequent to mRNA translation, may be vital to the function of receptor signaling.

 The signal sequence plays a crucial role in directing proteins to their correct destinations within the cell. Proteins that are synthesized for export or for specific organelles require sorting signals to ensure their proper localization. These sorting signals, also known as signal peptides, are typically found within the first 15 to 60 amino acids at the amino-terminus of a newly synthesized protein.

For example, proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often have a signal sequence consisting of five to ten hydrophobic amino acids at their amino-termini. This signal sequence acts as a recognition motif for a protein called the signal-recognition particle (SRP). When the SRP interacts with the signal sequence, it halts further growth of the polypeptide chain, temporarily arresting protein synthesis.

Once the SRP binds to the signal sequence, it forms a complex with the ribosome, forming what is known as the SRP-polyribosome complex with arrested polypeptide synthesis. This complex is then transported towards the ER membrane, where the nascent protein can be inserted or translocated across the membrane. This translocation process involves the release of introns and the resumption of translational arrest, ultimately leading to the proper localization of the protein.

In summary, the signal sequence serves as a targeting signal for proteins, guiding them to their correct destinations within the cell. Through interactions with the SRP and other cellular machinery, the signal sequence ensures the accurate sorting and localization of proteins during their synthesis and transport processes.

This targeting is achieved through the interaction and docking of SRP with its cognate SRP receptor, which is in close proximity to the translocon.

In eukaryotes, there are three domains involved in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis that facilitate the successful targeting of SRP to the SRP receptor. These domains are present in the SRP receptor subunits (SRα and SRβ) and the SRP protein SRP54.

Once the ribosome-nascent chain complex is docked at the translocon, the nascent peptide chain is inserted into the translocon channel and enters the ER. At this point, SRP is released from the ribosome and protein synthesis resumes. The SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates through GTP hydrolysis, allowing the cycle of SRP-mediated protein translocation to continue.

Overall, the function of the signal recognition particle is to recognize and target proteins to specific cellular locations, such as the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. By facilitating the translocation of proteins, SRP plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper localization and function of various proteins within the cell.

 3 -3.51283 SRP (signal recognition particle) plays a crucial role in facilitating the protein translocation process by recognizing and targeting specific proteins to their respective destinations, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. When a protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence emerges from the ribosome during translation, SRP binds to this signal sequence, leading to a slowdown in protein synthesis known as "elongation arrest." This process is conserved and enables the coupling of protein translation and translocation.

Once SRP binds to the signal sequence, it targets the entire ribosome-nascent chain complex to the protein-conducting channel, also known as the translocon, in the ER membrane. This targeting is achieved through the interaction and docking of SRP with its cognate SRP receptor, which is located close to the translocon.

The successful targeting of SRP to the SRP receptor requires the coordinated binding of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) by both SRP and the SRP receptor. In eukaryotes, there are three domains involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis: two in the SRP receptor subunits (SRα and SRβ) and one in the SRP protein (SRP54 or Ffh in bacteria).

Once the ribosome-nascent chain complex docks with the translocon, the nascent peptide chain is inserted into the translocon channel and enters the ER. At this point, SRP is released from the ribosome, and protein synthesis resumes. The complex between SRP and the SRP receptor dissociates through GTP hydrolysis, allowing the cycle of SRP-mediated protein translocation to continue.

It is important to note that the translocation process does not end with SRP's facilitation of targeting to the translocon. Once inside the ER, the signal sequence is typically cleaved, and further chaperones and enzymes assist in guiding the protein's folding, assembly, and eventual transport to its final destination within the cell.

 4 -4.47242 The signal sequence plays a crucial role in directing proteins to their correct destinations within the cell. Proteins that are synthesized for export or for specific organelles require sorting signals to ensure their proper localization. These sorting signals, also known as signal peptides, are typically found within the first 15 to 60 amino acids at the amino-terminus of a newly synthesized protein.

For example, proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often have a signal sequence consisting of five to ten hydrophobic amino acids at their amino-termini. This signal sequence acts as a recognition motif for a protein called the signal-recognition particle (SRP). When the SRP interacts with the signal sequence, it halts further growth of the polypeptide chain, temporarily arresting protein synthesis.

Once the SRP binds to the signal sequence, it forms a complex with the ribosome, forming what is known as the SRP-polyribosome complex with arrested polypeptide synthesis. This complex is then transported towards the ER membrane, where the nascent protein can be inserted or translocated across the membrane. This translocation process involves the release of introns and the resumption of translational arrest, ultimately leading to the proper localization of the protein.

In summary, the signal sequence serves as a targeting signal for proteins, guiding them to their correct destinations within the cell. Through interactions with the SRP and other cellular machinery, the signal sequence ensures the accurate sorting and localization of proteins during their synthesis and transport processes.

Reference:
- Proteins synthesis begins within the nucleus with transcription, during which the genetic code for a protein is transcribed from DNA to mRNA precursors. The complex containing the SRP–polyribosome complex with arrested polypeptide synthesis is then relocated toward the rER excision of introns release of translational arrest. (Source: Reference Text)
 5 -4.88589 A signal peptide plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by guiding the newly synthesized protein to its intended destination within the cell. It is an amino acid sequence located at the amino terminus of a secreted protein. The signal peptide acts as a targeting signal, facilitating the proper trafficking and localization of the protein to specific cellular compartments or the cell membrane.

During protein synthesis, the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome and interacts with signal recognition particles (SRPs). The SRPs recognize the signal peptide and temporarily pause protein synthesis. This pause allows the ribosome with the nascent protein to bind to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where the protein will be translocated.

The signal peptide interacts with a translocation machinery on the ER membrane known as the translocon. This machinery facilitates the transport of the protein across the ER membrane. Once the protein is translocated into the ER, the signal peptide is typically cleaved off by signal peptidases. This cleavage step completes the process of protein targeting and ensures the protein functions correctly in its designated compartment.

In summary, the signal peptide acts as a molecular "zip code" that guides proteins to specific cellular locations during protein synthesis. It is essential for proper protein trafficking, localization, and functionality within the cell.

['In Sweden, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a major predator of hares (Lepus timidus). However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. vulpis). As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nIn a study conducted in Sweden, researchers found that as mite population sizes increased, fox populations decreased and hare populations increased. This is because the mange mite weakens and kills foxes, reducing their ability to hunt and prey on hares. As a result, hare populations are able to increase in the absence of their primary predator.\n\nThe study also found that the decline in fox populations led to a decrease in the number of fox dens, which in turn led to a decrease in the number of fox pups born each year. This suggests that the decline in fox populations may have long-term consequences for the population dynamics of both foxes and hares.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the complex and interconnected relationships between predators and prey, and the importance of understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of parasite-mediated interactions', 'In Sweden, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) severely limits populations of its prey, including hares.

  the foxes are more likely to compete with goshawks over grouse as prey. A decrease of the fox population of Norway due to sarcoptic mange was found result in an increase of grouse numbers and, in turn, northern goshawks. In some areas, red foxes have been found to steal up to half of the goshawks’ kills. Unlike the predators at the top of the avian food chain such as eagles and the largest owls, which are rarely endangered by predation as adults, the northern goshawk is itself susceptible to a fairly extensive range of predators.

  the number of foxes in a territory decreases. On the coasts of Svalbard, the frequency of complex social structures is larger than inland foxes that remain monogamous due to food availability. In Scandinavia, there are more complex social structures compared to other populations due to the presence of the red fox. Also, conservationists are supplying the declining population with supplemental food. One unique case, however, is Iceland where monogamy is the most prevalent. The older offspring (1-year-olds) often remain within their parent's territory even though predators are absent and there are fewer resources, which may indicate kin selection in the fox.

PVA was conducted with the goals of 1) evaluating the island fox’s extinction risk, 2) estimating the island fox’s sensitivity to catastrophic events, and 3) evaluating recent recovery efforts which include release of captive-bred foxes and transport of wild juvenile foxes from the west to the east side. Results of the PVA concluded that the island fox is still at significant risk of extinction, and is highly susceptible to catastrophes that occur more than once every 20 years. Furthermore, extinction risks and future population sizes on both sides of the island were significantly dependent on the number of foxes released and transported each year.

 The two assumptions that can be made about the negative effect on the native European hare after the introduction of the invasive Eastern cottontail, mediated by an increased predation rate by foxes, are as follows:

1. Increase in Cottontail Abundance: One assumption is that with the increase in cottontail population, there would be a corresponding increase in the fox population. This, in turn, would magnify the predatory impact of foxes on the native European hares. This phenomenon is known as "hyperpredation," where the introduction of an invasive prey species leads to an increase in the predator population, resulting in a higher predation rate on the native prey species.

2. Patch Attraction and Spatial Overlap: The second assumption is that the presence of cottontails attracts foxes to the patches where they inhabit. These patches, which are important resting sites for hares, may also experience an increased presence of foxes due to the presence of cottontails. This increased presence of foxes in the same areas as the hares results in a higher predation rate on the native European hares.

Both of these assumptions, either individually or in combination, can lead to a negative effect on the native hare population as a result of the introduction of invasive Eastern cottontails and the subsequent increase in predation by foxes.

In addition to predators, the introduction of rabbits to central Australia also strained the populations of Lake Mackay hare-wallaby by creating competition over resources such as food and shelter. The droughts that affected Central Australia in the 1900s were responsible for a surge of forest fires which can also be attributed to the decline of the Lagorchestes asomatus.

  There are many important cell functions that take place in the nucleus, more specifically in the nucleoplasm. The main function of the nucleoplasm is to provide the proper environment for essential processes that take place in the nucleus and to store the structures that are used in these processes. In fact, the nucleoplasm stores about 34% of proteins found in the human body. These proteins take part in transcription and gene regulation in the nucleoplasm. Proteins located in the nucleoplasm are involved in the activation of genes that are used in the cell cycle. Some nucleoporins which typically make up the nuclear pore, can be mobile and participate in the regulation of gene expression in the nucleoplasm. The nuclear pore is where molecules travel from inside the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm and vice versa. The nucleoplasm is also a route for many molecules to travel through. Smaller molecules are able to pass freely through the nuclear pore to get into and out of the nucleoplasm, while larger proteins need the help of receptors on the surface of the nuclear envelope.

  The nucleoplasm is a type of protoplasm that makes up the cell nucleus, the most prominent organelle of the eukaryotic cell. It is enclosed by the nuclear envelope, also known as the nuclear membrane. The nucleoplasm resembles the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell in that it is a gel-like substance found within a membrane, although the nucleoplasm only fills out the space in the nucleus and has its own unique functions. The nucleoplasm suspends structures within the nucleus that are not membrane-bound and is responsible for maintaining the shape of the nucleus. The structures suspended in the nucleoplasm include chromosomes, nuclear bodies, nucleoporins, and nuclear speckles. Nucleoplasm is also known as karyoplasm, karyolymph or nucleus sap. The soluble, liquid portion of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol or nuclear hyaloplasm.

 The nucleus of a cell plays a crucial role in controlling cell functions and is closely connected to DNA. The nucleus contains genetic material known as DNA, which holds the instructions for building molecules, especially proteins, that carry out various cellular processes. Within the nucleus, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes.

The DNA in the nucleus is responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information from one generation to another. It contains all the necessary instructions for the cell's activities and determines the traits and characteristics of an organism. The nucleus ensures the accurate replication and transmission of DNA during cell division, which is essential for maintaining the proper functioning of the organism.

To carry out its functions, the nucleus interacts with other cellular components. For instance, the nucleolus, a structure within the nucleus, produces ribosomes, which are involved in protein synthesis. These ribosomes move out to the cytoplasm to assist in protein production.

The nucleus controls cell function by utilizing the information stored in DNA. It acts as a "library" of the cell, holding valuable information necessary for cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The chromosomes within the nucleus contain the instructions for building cells, and proteins in the nucleus transcribe these instructions into RNA molecules. These RNA molecules are then transported to the cytoplasm, where they direct the behavior of the cell.

In summary, the nucleus of a cell controls cell function by housing the DNA and its instructions for building proteins. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall function of the cell and is essential for the proper functioning of organisms.

  In 1933, while studying virgin sea urchin eggs, Jean Brachet suggested that DNA is found in cell nucleus and that RNA is present exclusively in the cytoplasm. At the time, "yeast nucleic acid" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH. During the 1930s, Joachim Hämmerling conducted experiments with Acetabularia in which he began to distinguish the contributions of the nucleus and the cytoplasm substances (later discovered to be DNA and mRNA, respectively) to cell morphogenesis and development.

  Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures.

 The main components of a nondividing cell nucleus are chromatin, nucleolus, nuclear envelope, and nucleoplasm. 

Chromatin refers to the nuclear material organized as euchromatin or heterochromatin. It contains genetic information in the form of DNA, which is tightly coiled around proteins called histones. The organization of chromatin plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and controlling cellular processes.

The nucleolus is a distinct structure within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and ribosome assembly take place. It plays a vital role in protein synthesis as it produces and assembles ribosomes, which are responsible for translating genetic information into proteins.

The nuclear envelope acts as a protective barrier surrounding the nucleus. It consists of two lipid bilayers and contains nuclear pores that regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This allows communication and the exchange of important molecules such as RNA and proteins between the nucleus and other cellular compartments.

The nucleoplasm is the fluid-filled region within the nucleus where various cellular processes occur. It contains the genetic material and provides a structural platform for cytoplasmic reactions. It supports processes like DNA replication and RNA transcription and processing. Furthermore, it plays a critical role in regulating the movement of organelles and cytoplasmic transport within the cell.

Overall, the components of a nondividing cell nucleus work together to maintain the integrity of genetic information, regulate gene expression, and facilitate essential cellular processes, such as protein synthesis and transportation.

The rate of reaction, r, can be expressed as:\n\nr = k\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, which is a measure of the speed of the reaction. The units of k depend on the units of time used to measure the rate of reaction. For example, if the rate of reaction is measured in moles per liter per second (mol/L/s), then the units of k would be reciprocal seconds (s^-1).\n\nIn a zero-order reaction, the rate of reaction is constant and does not change with time. This means that the concentration of the reactant decreases linearly with time. The concentration of the reactant, [A], can be expressed as:\n\n[A] = [A]0 - kt\n\nwhere [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant and t is the time.\n\nFor example, consider the reaction:\n\n2 NO(g) → 2 NO2(g)\n\nIf the initial concentration of NO is 0.1 M and the rate constant is 0.001 s^-1, then the rate of reaction is:\n\nr = k [A]\n\nr = 0.', 'The rate, r, of a zero-order chemical reaction A → B can be expressed as which of the following?The rate, r, of a zero-order chemical reaction A → B can be expressed as which of the following?\nA. r = k ln[A]\nB. r = k [A]^2\nC. r = k [A]\nD. r = k']

This suggests that the rate is determined by a step in which two molecules react, with the CO molecule entering at another, faster, step. A possible mechanism in two elementary steps that explains the rate equation is: In this mechanism the reactive intermediate species is formed in the first step with rate r1 and reacts with CO in the second step with rate r2. However can also react with NO if the first step occurs in the reverse direction (NO +  → 2 ) with rate r−1, where the minus sign indicates the rate of a reverse reaction. The concentration of a reactive intermediate such as [] remains low and almost constant. It

  As an example, consider the gas-phase reaction + CO → NO +. If this reaction occurred in a single step, its reaction rate (r) would be proportional to the rate of collisions between and CO molecules: r = k[][CO], where k is the reaction rate constant, and square brackets indicate a molar concentration. Another typical example is the Zel'dovich mechanism.

  therefore be estimated by the steady-state approximation, which specifies that the rate at which it is formed equals the (total) rate at which it is consumed. In this example is formed in one step and reacts in two, so that The statement that the first step is the slow step actually means that the first step in the reverse direction is slower than the second step in the forward direction, so that almost all is consumed by reaction with CO and not with NO. That is, r−1 ≪ r2, so that r1 − r2 ≈ 0. But the overall rate of reaction is the rate of formation of final product (here ), so that r = r2 ≈ r1. That is, the overall rate is determined by the rate of the first step, and (almost) all molecules that react at the first step continue to the fast second step.

  In chemical kinetics, the overall rate of a reaction is often approximately determined by the slowest step, known as the rate-determining step (RDS) or rate-limiting step. For a given reaction mechanism, the prediction of the corresponding rate equation (for comparison with the experimental rate law) is often simplified by using this approximation of the rate-determining step. In principle, the time evolution of the reactant and product concentrations can be determined from the set of simultaneous rate equations for the individual steps of the mechanism, one for each step. However, the analytical solution of these differential equations is not always easy, and in some cases numerical integration may even be required. The hypothesis of a single

If the first step were at equilibrium, then its equilibrium constant expression permits calculation of the concentration of the intermediate in terms of more stable (and more easily measured) reactant and product species: which disagrees with the experimental rate law given above, and so disproves the hypothesis that the second step is rate-determining for this reaction. However, some other reactions are believed to involve rapid pre-equilibria prior to the rate-determining step, as shown below.

['Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool used to identify and quantify organic and inorganic compounds. IR spectroscopy is based on the absorption of infrared radiation by molecular bonds. The absorption of IR radiation by a molecule is due to the vibration of the molecular bonds.

  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects high-resolution spectral data over a wide spectral range. This confers a significant advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time. The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy originates from the fact that a Fourier transform (a mathematical process) is required to convert the raw data into the actual spectrum.

  The goal of absorption spectroscopy techniques (FTIR, ultraviolet-visible ("UV-Vis") spectroscopy, etc.) is to measure how much light a sample absorbs at each wavelength. The most straightforward way to do this, the "dispersive spectroscopy" technique, is to shine a monochromatic light beam at a sample, measure how much of the light is absorbed, and repeat for each different wavelength. (This is how some UV–vis spectrometers work, for example.) Fourier-transform spectroscopy is a less intuitive way to obtain the same information. Rather than shining a monochromatic beam of light (a beam composed of only a single wavelength) at the sample, this technique shines a beam containing many frequencies of light at once

 Infrared spectroscopy plays a significant role in the identification of compound structures and the research of biological activity in natural and organic drug molecules. It provides valuable information about the functional groups present in a molecule and helps in determining its structural characteristics.

Theoretical calculations using methods such as density functional theory have improved the accuracy and reliability of infrared spectrum simulations. By performing calculations and optimizations, researchers can obtain the stable structure and vibration modes of a compound. In the study mentioned, density functional theory was used to calculate the geometry optimizations and frequencies of 7-Hydroxycoumarin.

The results of infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the infrared absorption peaks of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were mainly distributed in specific wave number regions. These regions corresponded to different functional groups and bonds in the molecule. For example, the wave number range of 3,700-3,500 cm(-1) was attributed to OH stretching vibration, while the range of 3,150-3,000 cm(-1) was related to benzene ring CH stretching vibration.

In addition to these specific regions, other vibration modes were also observed, forming complex spectral peaks composed of multiple vibration modes. By analyzing these vibration modes and assigning them to specific parts of the molecule, researchers can gain insights into the structural and functional properties of 7-Hydroxycoumarin, or any other compound under investigation.

Furthermore, the correlation between experimental infrared data and calculated infrared data can be analyzed to assess the reliability of the theoretical calculation method. In the mentioned study, a correlation diagram was drawn to compare the theoretical and experimental IR values of the main absorption peak of the 7-hydroxyl group. The results showed a good correlation between the two data sets, indicating the accuracy of the theoretical calculations.

Overall, infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations provides valuable information for identifying compound structures and studying the biological activity of natural and organic drug molecules.

  An infrared microscope allows samples to be observed and spectra measured from regions as small as 5 microns across. Images can be generated by combining a microscope with linear or 2-D array detectors. The spatial resolution can approach 5 microns with tens of thousands of pixels. The images contain a spectrum for each pixel and can be viewed as maps showing the intensity at any wavelength or combination of wavelengths. This allows the distribution of different chemical species within the sample to be seen. Typical studies include analysing tissue sections as an alternative to conventional histopathology and examining the homogeneity of pharmaceutical tablets.

 The purpose of infrared spectroscopy is to analyze and identify compounds based on their absorption of infrared radiation. It is a technique that falls under the broader field of spectroscopy, specifically focusing on the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Infrared spectroscopy works by measuring the interaction between molecules and infrared light. When a sample is exposed to infrared radiation, certain wavelengths are absorbed by specific chemical bonds within the molecules. By analyzing these absorption patterns, scientists can determine the types of bonds present in a compound, as well as its overall structure and composition.

One way that infrared spectroscopy contributes to compound identification is through the use of correlation tables. These tables provide reference data that allow scientists to compare observed absorption peaks with known functional groups and bond vibrations. By matching up these characteristic peaks, researchers can make informed conclusions about the presence or absence of certain functional groups in a compound.

Additionally, infrared spectroscopy can be used to investigate sample composition. By analyzing the absorption patterns across different regions of the infrared spectrum, scientists can gain insights into various aspects of a sample's composition. For example, they can determine if certain impurities or contaminants are present, or identify specific components within a mixture.

Overall, infrared spectroscopy plays a crucial role in compound identification and sample composition investigation by providing valuable information about molecular structure and bonding. Its ability to analyze a wide range of compounds makes it a versatile tool in many areas of scientific research and analysis.

 1 0.84670 Infrared spectroscopy plays a significant role in the identification of compound structures and the research of biological activity in natural and organic drug molecules. It provides valuable information about the functional groups present in a molecule and helps in determining its structural characteristics.

Theoretical calculations using methods such as density functional theory have improved the accuracy and reliability of infrared spectrum simulations. By performing calculations and optimizations, researchers can obtain the stable structure and vibration modes of a compound. In the study mentioned, density functional theory was used to calculate the geometry optimizations and frequencies of 7-Hydroxycoumarin.

The results of infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the infrared absorption peaks of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were mainly distributed in specific wave number regions. These regions corresponded to different functional groups and bonds in the molecule. For example, the wave number range of 3,700-3,500 cm(-1) was attributed to OH stretching vibration, while the range of 3,150-3,000 cm(-1) was related to benzene ring CH stretching vibration.

In addition to these specific regions, other vibration modes were also observed, forming complex spectral peaks composed of multiple vibration modes. By analyzing these vibration modes and assigning them to specific parts of the molecule, researchers can gain insights into the structural and functional properties of 7-Hydroxycoumarin, or any other compound under investigation.

Furthermore, the correlation between experimental infrared data and calculated infrared data can be analyzed to assess the reliability of the theoretical calculation method. In the mentioned study, a correlation diagram was drawn to compare the theoretical and experimental IR values of the main absorption peak of the 7-hydroxyl group. The results showed a good correlation between the two data sets, indicating the accuracy of the theoretical calculations.

Overall, infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations provides valuable information for identifying compound structures and studying the biological activity of natural and organic drug molecules. It offers insights into the functional groups, bonds, and vibration modes of a compound, aiding in the understanding of its properties and potential applications in drug research.

['In a three-component system, the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other is three. This is because the Gibbs phase rule states that the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of independent variables that can be varied without changing the phase composition) is given by:\n\nf = n - p + 2\n\nwhere n is the number of components and p is the number of phases. In a three-component system, n = 3. If we have three phases in equilibrium, p = 3. Therefore, f = 3 - 3 + 2 = 2. This means that there are only two degrees of freedom, which can be thought of as the temperature and pressure.\n\nHowever, in order for three phases to be in equilibrium, there must be a tie line in the phase diagram. A tie line is a line that connects the points of coexistence of two phases. In a three-component system, there are three possible tie lines, which correspond to the three possible pairs of phases that can be in equilibrium.\n\nFor example, in a binary-ternary system, the tie line between the liquid and solid phases is given by the eutectic point. The tie line between the liquid and vapor phases is given by the boiling point curve. The tie line between the solid and vapor phases is given by the sublimation point curve.\n\nIn', 'What is the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other in a three component mixture?What is the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other in a three component mixture?\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 4\nD. 5']

  temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. This means that when a nonvolatile solute is added, the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase is

  The quantity called "free energy" is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term affinity, which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the force that caused chemical reactions. In 1873, Josiah Willard Gibbs published A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces, in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies composed of part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume-entropy-internal energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of

  terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the solvent. Thus, a

  solution. If the solute is also volatile, one of the key assumptions used in deriving the formula is not true, since it derived for solutions of non-volatile solutes in a volatile solvent. In the case of volatile solutes it is more relevant to talk of a mixture of volatile compounds and the effect of the solute on the boiling point must be determined from the phase diagram of the mixture. In such cases, the mixture can sometimes have a boiling point that is lower than either of the pure components; a mixture with a minimum boiling point is a type of azeotrope.

 Gibbs' phase rule, formulated by Josiah Willard Gibbs in the 1870s, is a fundamental principle used to understand and analyze phase diagrams. It relates the number of phases, degrees of freedom, and chemical components in a system.

The phase rule is represented by the equation π + F = C + 2, where π represents the number of phases present in equilibrium (such as solid, liquid, or gas), F represents the number of degrees of freedom or independent variables (usually temperature, pressure, and composition), and C represents the number of chemical components required to describe the system.

The term "phases" refers to distinct states of matter that coexist in a system at equilibrium. These can include solids, liquids, gases, or combinations thereof. The number of phases can vary depending on factors such as temperature and pressure.

Degrees of freedom are the independent variables that can be varied without affecting the overall equilibrium state. In other words, they represent the number of parameters that can be changed while still maintaining a stable system. The degrees of freedom typically include temperature, pressure, and composition.

Chemical components refer to the minimum number of chemically independent constituents needed to fully describe a system. For example, if we consider water as a single component system (H2O), then C would be equal to 1. However, if we consider a mixture containing both water (H2O) and ethanol (C2H5OH), then C would be equal to 2.

By applying Gibbs' phase rule equation π + F = C + 2 to a given system's conditions and properties such as temperature and pressure variations along with knowledge about its chemical components involved one can determine how many phases will exist at equilibrium under those conditions.

Overall, Gibbs' phase rule provides valuable insights into understanding how different factors like phases present in equilibrium, degrees of freedom available for variation within a system's properties, and the number of chemical components required to describe the system are interrelated. It is a fundamental principle that aids in the analysis and interpretation of phase diagrams.

  It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities. For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (T) on one axis, pressure (p) on a second axis, and specific volume (v) on a third. Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a p–v–T diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a triple line is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram. For water, the 3D p–v–T diagram is seen here: An orthographic projection of the 3D p–v–T graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

  Common components of a phase diagram are lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries, which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium. Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium. Metastable phases are not shown in phase diagrams as, despite their common occurrence, they are not equilibrium phases. Triple points are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect. Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium (273.16 K and a partial vapor pressure of 611.657 Pa). The solidus is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The liquidus is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a "slurry"). Working fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

More generally, let P be any series composition of three-element partial orders and of one-element partial orders, such as the one in the figure. Then P forms an extreme case for the 1/3–2/3 conjecture in the sense that, for each pair x, y of elements, one of the two elements occurs earlier than the other in at most 1/3 of the linear extensions of P. Partial orders with this structure are necessarily series-parallel semiorders; they are the only known extreme cases for the conjecture and can be proven to be the only extreme cases with width two.

  The existence of frigorific mixtures can be viewed as a consequence of the Gibbs phase rule, which describes the relationship at equilibrium between the number of components, the number of coexisting phases, and the number of degrees of freedom permitted by the conditions of heterogeneous equilibrium. Specifically, at constant atmospheric pressure, in a system containing C linearly independent chemical components, if C+1 phases are specified to be present in equilibrium, then the system is fully determined (there are no degrees of freedom). That is, the temperature and the compositions of all phases are determined. Thus, in for example the chemical system H2O-NaCl, which has two components, the simultaneous presence of the three phases liquid, ice, and hydrohalite can exist only at atmospheric pressure at the unique temperature of –21.2 °C . The approach to equilibrium of a frigorific mixture involves spontaneous temperature change driven by the conversion of latent heat into sensible heat as the phase proportions adjust to accommodate the decrease in thermodynamic potential associated with the approach to equilibrium.

Working fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. This means that when a nonvolatile solute is added, the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase is 
 4 -9.50478  It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities. For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (T) on one axis, pressure (p) on a second axis, and specific volume (v) on a third. Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a p–v–T diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a triple line is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram. For water, the 3D p–v–T diagram is seen here: An orthographic projection of the 3D p–v–T graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the solvent. Thus, a

It relates the number of phases, degrees of freedom, and chemical components in a system. The phase rule is represented by the equation π + F = C + 2, where π represents the number of phases present in equilibrium (such as solid, liquid, or gas), F represents the number of degrees of freedom or independent variables (usually temperature, pressure, and composition), and C represents the number of chemical components required to describe the system.

In other words, they represent the number of parameters that can be changed while still maintaining a stable system. Chemical components refer to the minimum number of chemically independent constituents needed to fully describe a system. For example, if we consider water as a single component system (H2O), then C would be equal to 1. By applying Gibbs' phase rule equation π + F = C + 2 to a given system's conditions and properties such as temperature and pressure variations along with knowledge about its chemical components involved one can determine how many phases will exist at equilibrium under those conditions.

  Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is a very strong oxidant able to react with many functional groups, such as secondary alcohols, 1,2-diols, aldehydes, alkenes, oximes, sulfides and thiols. Under controlled conditions, KMnO4 oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids very efficiently. This reaction, which was first described in detail by Fournier, is typically carried out by adding KMnO4 to a solution or suspension of the alcohol in an alkaline aqueous solution. The resulting mixture is stirred until the oxidation is complete. For the reaction to proceed efficiently, the alcohol must be at least partially dissolved in the aqueous solution. This can be facilitated by the addition of an organic co-solvent such as dioxane, pyridine, acetone or t-BuOH. KMnO4 will

  Ernest L. Eliel has proposed that the hypothetical reaction of cyclohexyl iodide with radiolabeled iodide would result in a completely symmetric transition state. Because both the equatorial and axial-substituted conformers would react through the same transition state, ΔΔG‡ would equal zero. By the Curtin–Hammett principle, the distribution of products should then be 50% axial substituted and 50% equatorial substituted. However, equilibration of the products precludes observation of this phenomenon.

  to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law. Another alternative uses N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the oxidizing agent, in the presence of potassium iodide and starch. The NBS first oxidizes the ascorbic acid; when the latter is exhausted, the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide, which then forms the blue-black complex with starch.

   The first law of thermodynamics provides the definition of the internal energy of a thermodynamic system, and expresses the law of conservation of energy. The second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes. It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense, and is not reversible. For example, when a path for conduction and radiation is made available, heat always flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body. Such phenomena are accounted for in terms of entropy. If an isolated system is held initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning impermeable walls, and then some operation makes the walls more permeable, then the system spontaneously evolves to reach a final new internal thermodynamic

 The state functions of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics are internal energy (U), enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). These state functions play a crucial role in determining the feasibility or spontaneity of a given transformation.

Internal energy (U) represents the total energy of a system, including both its kinetic and potential energies. Enthalpy (H) is the sum of the internal energy and the product of pressure and volume. It is often used to describe heat changes in chemical reactions.

Entropy (S) measures the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. It is related to the number of possible arrangements of particles within a system. The increase in entropy indicates greater disorder, while a decrease signifies more order.

Gibbs free energy (G) combines both enthalpy and entropy to determine whether a reaction will occur spontaneously under certain conditions. A negative value for Gibbs free energy indicates that a reaction is feasible and spontaneous, while a positive value suggests that it is not.

These state functions are interconnected through various equations derived from the laws of thermodynamics. For example, the first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. This principle applies to all state functions mentioned above.

In summary, by analyzing these state functions and their relationships, chemical thermodynamics provides insights into the feasibility and spontaneity of chemical transformations.

  The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. Entropy predicts the direction of spontaneous processes, and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. If all processes in the system are reversible, the entropy is constant. An increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time. Historically, the second law was an empirical finding that was accepted as an axiom of thermodynamic theory. Statistical mechanics provides a microscopic explanation of the law in

  was first published in 1862 in Clausius' sixth memoir, "On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations to Interior Work". Clausius sought to show a proportional relationship between entropy and the energy flow by heating (δQ) into a system. In a system, this heat energy can be transformed into work, and work can be transformed into heat through a cyclical process. Clausius writes that "The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be less than zero, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing." In other words, the equation  If the amount of energy added by heating can be measured during the process, and the temperature can be measured during the process, the Clausius inequality can be used to determine whether the process is reversible or irreversible by carrying out the integration in the Clausius inequality.

   In thermodynamics, the reversible work involved when a gas changes from state A to state B is  By convention, work is defined as the work on the system by its surroundings. If, for example, the system is compressed, then the work is positive and the internal energy of the system increases. Conversely, if the system expands, it does work on the surroundings and the internal energy of the system decreases. It is also worth noting that for ideal gases, if the temperature is held constant, the internal energy of the system also is constant, and so ΔU = 0. Since the First Law of Thermodynamics states that ΔU = Q + W (IUPAC convention), it follows that Q = −W for the isothermal compression or expansion of ideal gases.

  is achieved by the generation of heat. Conversely, for a constant-pressure endothermic reaction, ΔH is positive and equal to the heat absorbed in the reaction. From the definition of enthalpy as H = U + pV , the enthalpy change at constant pressure is ΔH = ΔU + p ΔV . However for most chemical reactions, the work term p ΔV is much smaller than the internal energy change ΔU , which is approximately equal to ΔH . As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g), ΔH = −566.0 kJ and ΔU = −563.5 kJ . Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of bond energies.

  In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, pV, differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system. Energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure p remains constant; this is the pV term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, U, which includes activation energies, ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy U + pV . For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the pV work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system. For a simple system with a constant number of particles at constant pressure, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from an isobaric thermodynamic process.

 in order to return the system to its original state. In the reversible case, no entropy is created and the amount of entropy added is equal to the amount extracted. The Clausius theorem is a mathematical explanation of the second law of thermodynamics. It was developed by Rudolf Clausius who intended to explain the relationship between the heat flow in a system and the entropy of the system and its surroundings. Clausius developed this in his efforts to explain entropy and define it quantitatively. In more direct terms, the theorem gives us a way to determine if a cyclical process is reversible or irreversible. The Clausius theorem provides a quantitative formula for understanding the second law. Clausius was one of the first to work on the idea of entropy and is even responsible for giving it that name.

  using Hess's law – by calculating the energy produced by the reaction itself (subtracting the enthalpy of the reactants from the enthalpy of the products) and subtracting the energy consumed by heating the products (from their specific heat, when the materials only change their temperature, and their enthalpy of fusion and eventually enthalpy of vaporization, when the materials melt or boil). In real conditions, the reaction loses heat to the environment, the achieved temperature is therefore somewhat lower. The heat transfer rate is finite, so the faster the reaction is, the closer to adiabatic condition it runs and the higher is the achieved temperature.

In a solution of a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical with J << a, the EPR spectrum will have 3 lines due to the presence of two equivalent nitrogen nuclei and the small coupling constant J. This is because the spin Hamiltonian for a diradical with two equivalent nitrogen nuclei is:\n\nH = μB(gxSx + gySy + gzSz) + aSz + 2J(ISz + ISz')\n\nwhere Sx, Sy, Sz are the spin operators for the unpaired electron, and ISx, ISy, Iz are the spin operators for the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. The small coupling constant J causes the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei to have a weak interaction with the unpaired electron, resulting in a small splitting of the EPR spectrum. The three lines in the EPR spectrum correspond to the three possible spin states for the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei: (I1 = +1/2, I2 = +1/2), (I1 = +1/2, I2 = -1/2), and (I1 = -1/2, I2 = -1/2).\n\nIn contrast, if the nitronyl nitroxide", 'Nitronyl nitroxides are stable radicals in which the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.

  When ground state energies are different but transition state energies are similar, selectivity will be degraded in the transition state, and poor overall selectivity may be observed. For instance, high selectivity for one ground state conformer is observed in the following radical methylation reaction.  The conformer in which A(1,3) strain is minimized is at an energy minimum, giving 99:1 selectivity in the ground state. However, transition state energies depend both on the presence of A(1,3) strain and on steric hindrance associated with the incoming methyl radical. In this case, these two factors are in opposition, and the difference in transition state energies is small compared to the difference in ground state energies. As a result, poor overall selectivity is observed in the reaction.

  the wave functions of the two electronic states are subject to an arbitrary rotation. Therefore, the g and h vectors are also subject to a related arbitrary rotation, despite the fact that the space spanned by the two vectors is invariant. To enable a consistent representation of the branching space, the set of wave functions that makes the g and h vectors orthogonal is usually chosen. This choice is unique up to the signs and switchings of the two vectors, and allows these two vectors to have proper symmetry when the molecular geometry is symmetric. The degeneracy is preserved through first order by differential displacements that are perpendicular to the branching space. The

  Ernest L. Eliel has proposed that the hypothetical reaction of cyclohexyl iodide with radiolabeled iodide would result in a completely symmetric transition state. Because both the equatorial and axial-substituted conformers would react through the same transition state, ΔΔG‡ would equal zero. By the Curtin–Hammett principle, the distribution of products should then be 50% axial substituted and 50% equatorial substituted. However, equilibration of the products precludes observation of this phenomenon.

   Very few compounds of main group elements are paramagnetic. Notable examples include: oxygen, O2; nitric oxide, NO; nitrogen dioxide, NO2 and chlorine dioxide, ClO2. In organic chemistry, compounds with an unpaired electron are said to be free radicals. Free radicals, with some exceptions, are short-lived because one free radical will react rapidly with another, so their magnetic properties are difficult to study. However, if the radicals are well separated from each other in a dilute solution in a solid matrix, at low temperature, they can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Such radicals are generated by irradiation. Extensive EPR studies have revealed much about electron delocalization in free radicals. The simulated spectrum of the CH3• radical shows hyperfine splitting due to the interaction of the electron with the 3 equivalent hydrogen nuclei, each of which has a spin of 1/2. Spin labels are long-lived free radicals which can be inserted into organic molecules so that they can be studied by EPR. For example, the nitroxide MTSL, a functionalized derivative of TEtra Methyl Piperidine Oxide, TEMPO, is used in site-directed spin labeling.

  One-electron oxidation of the nitroxide produces a highly electrophilic oxoammonium species, which serves as the active oxidizing agent. The nitroxide can be used as a catalyst in conjunction with cheaper stoichiometric oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite or bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB). Under neutral or slightly acidic conditions (in the presence of silica gel, for instance), oxidation occurs by an initial hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the oxoammonium nitrogen, followed by concerted proton transfer and hydride abstraction. The need for hydrogen bonding is supported by the low reactivity of β-alkoxy and β-amino alcohols, which exhibit competitive intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The mechanism of oxidation under weakly basic (pyridine) conditions is similar, except that pyridine neutralizes the hydroxyammonium species, and this intermediate "comproportionates" with oxoammonium salt to give nitroxide

 High-frequency/high-field electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) has several advantages and disadvantages compared to electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and X-band ESEEM methods for studying nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole interactions on a disordered powder sample.

Advantages of using high-frequency/high-field ESEEM include:
1. Resolution of anisotropic g-matrix: At high microwave frequencies (W-band), the EPR spectrum of the nitroxide radical can resolve the anisotropic g-matrix, providing detailed information about the electronic structure.
2. Suppression of modulations from other nuclei: High-frequency/high-field ESEEM effectively suppresses modulations from nuclei other than nitrogen, such as protons, due to the cancellation condition for effective mixing of nuclear spin functions. This enables more accurate determination of the nitrogen (14N) hyperfine and quadrupole coupling tensors from powder measurements.
3. Verification with single crystals: The results obtained from high-frequency/high-field ESEEM can be verified by performing ESEEM measurements on single crystals, ensuring the reliability of the findings.

However, there are also some disadvantages of using high-frequency/high-field ESEEM:
1. Limited availability: High-frequency/high-field ESEEM requires specialized equipment that operates at frequencies of 95 GHz and fields of 3.4 T. Such facilities may not be widely available, limiting the accessibility of this technique.
2. Complexity: The use of high-frequency/high-field ESEEM may involve more complex experimental setups and data analysis compared to other methods, which can increase the level of technical expertise required.
3. Specific to nitrogen interactions: While high-frequency/high-field ESEEM excels in studying nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole interactions, it may not be suitable for investigating interactions involving other nuclei, limiting its versatility for broader studies.

In comparison, ENDOR and X-band ESEEM methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. ENDOR is capable of studying a wider range of nuclear interactions and does not require specialized high-frequency/high-field equipment. X-band ESEEM, operating at lower frequencies, may be more accessible and less complex but may suffer from interference from modulations of other nuclei.

It is important to consider the specific research objectives, available resources, and technical requirements when choosing the most suitable method for studying nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole interactions on a disordered powder sample.

  the Nh+/Nh couple. The relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons is very high and hence nihonium should predominantly form the +1 oxidation state; nevertheless, as for copernicium, the +3 oxidation state should be reachable. Because of the shell closure at flerovium caused by spin-orbit coupling, nihonium is also one 7p electron short of a closed shell and would hence form a −1 oxidation state; in both the +1 and −1 oxidation states, nihonium should show more similarities to astatine than thallium. The Nh+ ion is expected to also have some similarities to the Ag+ ion, particularly in its propensity for complexation. Nihonium oxide (Nh2O) is expected to be amphoteric.

 The radioisotope commonly used as a source for external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer patients is Cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt and is widely used due to its unique properties. It emits high-energy gamma rays which can penetrate deep into tissues and effectively kill cancer cells. Additionally, Cobalt-60 has a relatively long half-life of about 5.27 years, allowing it to provide a continuous and stable source of radiation for cancer treatment. This radioisotope is highly useful in delivering precise and targeted radiation therapy to cancerous tissues while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

 Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioisotope that is commonly used in a variety of applications, particularly in the field of medicine. It is created by bombarding natural cobalt-59 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This process transforms cobalt-59 into cobalt-60, which is a highly radioactive isotope.

Cobalt-60 is widely used in radiotherapy, where it plays a crucial role in the treatment of cancer. It emits high-energy gamma rays, which can penetrate tissues deeply and deliver targeted doses of radiation to tumor cells. This helps to destroy cancer cells and prevent their growth and spread. 

Apart from its medical applications, cobalt-60 also finds use in industrial radiography, where it is utilized to inspect metal parts for defects. Additionally, it is employed in sterilization processes to sanitize medical equipment, pharmaceutical products, and certain types of food.

However, due to its high levels of radioactivity, cobalt-60 requires strict handling precautions and containment measures to ensure the safety of both workers and the general public. Regulatory bodies closely monitor the use and disposal of cobalt-60 to prevent any potential hazards associated with its radioactive properties.

In summary, cobalt-60 is an artificial radioisotope that is invaluable in the field of medicine. Its use in radiotherapy allows for targeted treatment of cancer, while it also serves various purposes in industrial applications.

  Apart from its function as a research centre, the HFR is a large producer of radioactive material for the purpose of medical diagnosis and the treatment of cancer and contrast agents (Radiopharmaceuticals). The nuclear facility supplies 60% of the European demand for medical isotopes. Also at the high flux reactor, one of the neutron beam channels, which was originally installed for performing fundamental research, has been specially modified for the direct irradiation of patients. This allows use of neutrons for the treatment of tumors after saturation of these tumors with a pharmaceutical containing boron. When hit by a weak neutron beam, boron will locally emit radiation that will destroy the tumor. This technique is mainly suitable for the treatment of brain tumors.

 In both teletherapy and brachytherapy, the radioactive element commonly used is Cobalt 60. Cobalt 60 is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt, which emits gamma rays that can be used in cancer treatment. In teletherapy, also known as external beam radiation therapy, a Cobalt 60 machine is used to deliver radiation from outside the body to the tumor site. This type of radiation therapy is typically used for larger tumors or when a precise location targeting is required. 

On the other hand, in brachytherapy, Cobalt 60 is used as a source of radiation placed inside or near the tumor. This allows for a higher radiation dose to be delivered directly to the tumor, while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissues. It is particularly useful in treating localized cancers, as it provides a targeted approach to deliver radiation therapy.

Cobalt 60 has advantages in radiation therapy due to its ability to produce high-energy gamma rays, which can penetrate deep into tissues. It is an effective and widely used radioactive element for cancer treatment. The utilization of Cobalt 60 in teletherapy and brachytherapy plays a crucial role in delivering precise and effective radiation therapy to patients.

 The radioisotope used in teletherapy is Co-60, also known as cobalt-60. It is commonly used in radiation therapy to treat cancer and other medical conditions. Cobalt-60 emits high-energy gamma rays, which can penetrate the body and target cancer cells, damaging their DNA and preventing their growth and division. This radioisotope is preferred for teletherapy due to its relatively long half-life, which allows for a continuous supply of radiation over an extended period of time. Cobalt-60 is typically housed in a machine called a teletherapy unit or a cobalt unit, which is designed to deliver precise and controlled doses of radiation to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.

  131I is a beta and gamma emitter. It is used both to destroy thyroid and thyroid cancer tissues (via beta radiation, which is short-range), and also other neuroendocrine tissues when used in MIBG. It can also be seen by a gamma camera, and can serve as a diagnostic imaging tracer, when treatment is also being attempted at the same time.

This isotope has a half-life of 10 days, making it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes).

 1 -3.83418 Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioisotope that is commonly used in a variety of applications, particularly in the field of medicine. It is created by bombarding natural cobalt-59 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This process transforms cobalt-59 into cobalt-60, which is a highly radioactive isotope.

Cobalt-60 is widely used in radiotherapy, where it plays a crucial role in the treatment of cancer. It emits high-energy gamma rays, which can penetrate tissues deeply and deliver targeted doses of radiation to tumor cells. This helps to destroy cancer cells and prevent their growth and spread. 

Apart from its medical applications, cobalt-60 also finds use in industrial radiography, where it is utilized to inspect metal parts for defects. Additionally, it is employed in sterilization processes to sanitize medical equipment, pharmaceutical products, and certain types of food.

However, due to its high levels of radioactivity, cobalt-60 requires strict handling precautions and containment measures to ensure the safety of both workers and the general public. Regulatory bodies closely monitor the use and disposal of cobalt-60 to prevent any potential hazards associated with its radioactive properties.

In summary, cobalt-60 is an artificial radioisotope that is invaluable in the field of medicine. Its use in radiotherapy allows for targeted treatment of cancer, while it also serves various purposes in industrial applications.

  some atoms with even number of electrons. In ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present,

  Many materials have unpaired electron spins, and the majority of these materials are paramagnetic. When the spins interact with each other in such a way that the spins align spontaneously, the materials are called ferromagnetic (what is often loosely termed as magnetic). Because of the way their regular crystalline atomic structure causes their spins to interact, some metals are ferromagnetic when found in their natural states, as ores. These include iron ore (magnetite or lodestone), cobalt and nickel, as well as the rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium (when at a very low temperature). Such naturally occurring ferromagnets were used in the first experiments with magnetism. Technology has since expanded the availability of magnetic materials to include various man-made products, all based, however, on naturally magnetic elements.

For metallic magnets, the unpaired electrons align through quantum mechanical effects (termed exchange) by virtue of the way in which the electrons fill the orbitals of the conductive band. For most oxide-based ceramic magnets, the unpaired electrons on the metal centers align via the intervening diamagnetic bridging oxide (termed superexchange).

 Ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are the ones normally thought of as magnetic; they are attracted to a magnet strongly enough that the attraction can be felt. These materials are the only ones that can retain magnetization and become magnets; a common example is a traditional refrigerator magnet. Ferrimagnetic materials, which include ferrites and the oldest magnetic materials magnetite and lodestone, are similar to but weaker than ferromagnetics. The difference between ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials is related to their microscopic structure, as explained in Magnetism. ; Paramagnetic substances, such as platinum, aluminum, and oxygen, are weakly attracted to either pole of a magnet. This attraction is hundreds of thousands of times weaker than that of ferromagnetic materials, so it can only be detected by using sensitive instruments

  atoms with filled electron shells have a total dipole moment of zero: because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., unpaired spins) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism occurs only in materials with partially filled shells. Because of Hund's rules, the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment. These unpaired dipoles (often called simply "spins" even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field, an effect called paramagnetism. Ferromagnetism involves an additional phenomenon, however: in a few substances the dipoles tend to align spontaneously, giving rise to a spontaneous magnetization, even when there is no applied field.

  using extremely strong magnets. Magnetic ferrofluids, although they are made of tiny ferromagnetic particles suspended in liquid, are sometimes considered paramagnetic since they cannot be magnetized. ; Diamagnetic means repelled by both poles. Compared to paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, diamagnetic substances, such as carbon, copper, water, and plastic, are even more weakly repelled by a magnet. The permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than the permeability of a vacuum. All substances not possessing one of the other types of magnetism are diamagnetic; this includes most substances. Although force on a diamagnetic object from an ordinary magnet is far too weak to be felt, using extremely strong superconducting magnets, diamagnetic objects such as pieces of lead and even mice can be levitated, so they float in mid-air.

The term magnet is typically reserved for objects that produce their own persistent magnetic field even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Only certain classes of materials can do this. Most materials, however, produce a magnetic field in response to an applied magnetic field – a phenomenon known as magnetism. There are several types of magnetism, and all materials exhibit at least one of them. The overall magnetic behavior of a material can vary widely, depending on the structure of the material, particularly on its electron configuration. Several forms of magnetic behavior have been observed in different materials, including: There are various other types of magnetism, such as spin glass, superparamagnetism, superdiamagnetism, and metamagnetism.

  Metal complexes that have unpaired electrons are magnetic. Considering only monometallic complexes, unpaired electrons arise because the complex has an odd number of electrons or because electron pairing is destabilized. Thus, monomeric Ti(III) species have one "d-electron" and must be (para)magnetic, regardless of the geometry or the nature of the ligands. Ti(II), with two d-electrons, forms some complexes that have two unpaired electrons and others with none. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX2[(CH3)2PCH2CH2P(CH3)2]2: when X = Cl, the complex is paramagnetic (high-spin configuration), whereas when X = CH3, it is diamagnetic (low-spin configuration). It is important to realize that ligands provide an important means of adjusting the ground state properties. In bi- and polymetallic complexes, in which the individual centres have an odd number of electrons or that are high-spin, the situation is more complicated. If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centres, the electrons may couple (antiferromagnetic coupling, resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other (ferromagnetic coupling). When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules.

If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centres, the electrons may couple (antiferromagnetic coupling, resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other (ferromagnetic coupling). When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic).

  atmospheric pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot be as easily recovered compared to other solvents, as it is very difficult to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional rotary evaporation. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and cryodesiccation to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, 18.5 C, means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. crystallization with cooling). In its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it

  a useful solvent for NMR spectroscopy, again due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of DMSO-d6 are its high viscosity, which broadens signals, and its hygroscopicity, which leads to an overwhelming H2O resonance in the 1H-NMR spectrum. It is often mixed with CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 for lower viscosity and melting points. DMSO is also used to dissolve test compounds in in vitro drug discovery and drug design screening programs (including high-throughput screening programs). This is because it is able to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds, can be used to maintain stock

  DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and is less toxic than other members of this class, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and HMPA. DMSO is frequently used as a solvent for chemical reactions involving salts, most notably Finkelstein reactions and other nucleophilic substitutions. It is also extensively used as an extractant in biochemistry and cell biology. Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions. A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution. Because of its high boiling point, 189 C, DMSO evaporates slowly at

 Diabetes is an emerging metabolic disorder. α-Glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, delay the hydrolysis of carbohydrates by interfering with the digestive enzymes. This action decreases the glucose absorption and the postprandial glucose level. We have synthesized 25 tricyclic 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-ones hybrids and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Compounds 6h and 6d have shown stronger activity than that of acarbose. Compound 6h exhibited the highest inhibition with an IC50 of 104.07 µM. Molecular modelling studies revealed that compound 6h inhibits α-glucosidase due to the formation of a stable ligand-α-glucosidase complex and extra hydrogen bond interactions, and directed in the binding site by Trp329.
The number of people with diabetes has increased worldwide. According to the global report in diabetes published by WHO in 2014, the number of the diabetic people has increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million. Risk factors for diabetes usually include older age, family history, race or ethnicity, obesity and physical inactivity. The prevalence of diabetes among people over 18 years old has increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014 . Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycaemia accompanied by carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism disturbance. The above-mentioned characteristics of diabetes result from insufficient insulin production in Type I diabetes or ineffective action of insulin in Type II diabetes. The increase in blood sugar levels can lead to serious damage to nerves and blood vessels, which causes a major risk on the individual’s health and quality of life.
Several strategies are used for diabetes management and one of them is controlling postprandial hyperglycaemia. Among postprandial hypoglycaemic agents are α-glucosidase inhibitors. α-Glucosidase inhibitors delay the carbohydrate hydrolysis by inhibiting digestive enzymes, and thus reducing postprandial glucose levels. Moreover, α-glucosidase inhibitors have been found to have a range of biological activities as opposed to other antidiabetic drugs (Acarbose, Miglitol and Voglibose). For example, Celgosivir displays antiviral activity against hepatitis C & B viruses and 1-deoxynojirimycin exhibits anticancer activity (Fig. 1). This variety of biological activity makes α-glucosidase inhibitors a class of compounds with multiple therapeutic applications.
Despite considerable advances in the development of new α-glucosidase inhibitors to treat diabetes, most of the produced compounds were sugar mimetic that requires tedious synthesis. Therefore, a number of compounds mimicking the monosaccharides or oligosaccharides were discovered. Among them, is the N-containing carbasugars such as validamine and valienamine, which have proven to be lead compounds for the development of clinically important agents such as acarbose (Fig. 1) . It has been shown that the valienamine moiety in acarbose mimics the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that binds to and inhibits α-glucosidase . Therefore, acarbose is an effective inhibitor against glucoamylase, sucrase, dextranase and maltase that prevents the digestion of complex carbohydrates, which are subsequently delivered to the colon. However, bacteria in the colon will digest the complex carbohydrates causing gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhoea. Clinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal side effects are the major cause for reduced patient compliance to the diabetic treatment.
The control of postprandial hyperglycaemia by α-glucosidase inhibitors is clinically effective. Several studies have shown that the addition of acarbose to other oral antidiabetic agents is associated with significant improvements in life expectancy and quality of life, and provides excellent money value over the patient lifetime. However, this advantage of the clinically available α-glucosidase inhibitors is losing its value because of the developed gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, there is a high demand for effective antidiabetic agents.
We are interested in exploring and developing α-glucosidase inhibitors in an attempt to overcome the side effects associated with sugar mimetic agents. According to our previous results, we decided to modify scaffolds well accepted in medicinal chemistry, such as pyridine, triazole, and pyrimidine. These scaffolds have been incorporated in a variety of compounds that displayed interesting pharmacological activities including antimicrobial [4, 5, 6], antiviral , anticancer , anti-inflammatory [9, 10], antioxidant  and anticonvulsant  activities. Moreover, pyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5,-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-ones have been reported as effective fungicidal and herbicidal agents [13, 14].
Herein, we designed two series of phenoxypyrido-triazolopyrimidinones and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. A significant inhibitory activity was observed for the newly synthesized compounds and IC50 values lower than that of acarbose were obtained for two compounds. Moreover, molecular docking studies against α-glucosidase were conducted. We could provide insights of a new lead scaffold for the development of new clinically effective antidiabetic drugs.
Melting points were measured in open-glass capillaries using a STUART SMP 10 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorder in DMSO-d6 either on a Bruker AMX 500 or 700 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS as δ ppm values. Spectrometers operated at either 500 or 700 MHz for 1H NMR and 175 MHz for 13C NMR. Coupling constants (J values) are given in Hz.

The Autodock software package was used to investigate the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the pyrido-triazolopyrimidines through molecular docking analysis . The original docked protein were downloaded from the RCSB data bank web site (PDB file with code 3W37) . The detailed steps for the molecular docking studies were reported by Abuelizz et al. .
Figure 2 illustrates the synthetic route towards fused pyrimidine derivatives. The starting material (A) was prepared according to a reported procedure . The incorporation of a hydrazine moiety to N-cyanoimidocarbonates to generate triazoles has been successfully achieved and is well documented [20, 21, 22]. Thus, 1,2,4-triazole intermediate B was obtained when an ethanolic solution of diphenyl-N-cyanoimidocarbonate was allowed to react with A in a basic medium (triethylamine) at room temperature. Upon the treatment of B with conc. HCl, initially at room temperature followed by heating, afforded novel 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-one (1) in 78% yield. The chemical structure of compound 1 was established on the basis of NMR, IR and mass spectra. The IR spectrum of 1 was characterized by a band at 1703 cm−1 due to a strong stretching vibration of a C=O group.
Under suitable conditions, the reaction of compound 1 with alkyl or heteroalkyl halides gave the expected N-alkylated pyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-ones (2a–l) in 45–83% yields (Fig. 2). The IR and NMR data confirmed the formation of N-alkylated products 2a–l. Compounds 2a–l were obtained as coloured amorphous powders and their IR spectra displayed absorption bands at 1670 − 1688 cm−1 due to the C=O group. Boiling equimolar amounts of target 1 and phosphorous pentasulfide in absolute pyridine furnished the desired 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-thione (3) as a yellow amorphous powder in excellent yield (90%). The IR and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 display a weak absorption band (1272 cm−1) and a peak resonance (186.0 ppm), respectively, due to the C=S group. The conversion of 3 into 4 was carried out in basic medium using benzyl bromide. The transformation of 1 into 5 was successfully achieved employing phosphorous oxychloride as chlorinating agent in boiling benzene followed by treatment with a saturated basic solution. The formation of 5 was followed by NMR and IR spectroscopy; the latter confirmed the completely disappearance of the C=O band characteristic in compound 1 at 1703 cm−1. The conversion of the lactam group in 1 into an imidoyl chloride moiety (5) was expected to provide a valuable intermediate for further displacement reactions with several nucleophiles. Reaction of 5 with hydroxylamine HCl in a molar ratio of 1:3 in boiling pyridine provided the corresponding product 6e in 63% yield (Fig. 2), while treatment of target 5 with several aromatic amines in pyridine in a molar ratio of 1:5 afforded the corresponding compounds 6a–d in 60–68% yields. The chlorine was replaced in 5 by isoniazid in boiling toluene to give amidrazone 6i in good yield (74%). Hydrazinolysis of 5 in boiling ethanol produced the corresponding compound 6f, which upon treatment with equimolar amounts of aldehydes resulted in the formation of hydrazone derivatives 6g and 6h in good yields (Fig. 2).
The 1H-NMR spectra of targets 1–6 were characterized by two consistent spin coupling systems, each consisting of three types of protons, indicative of the main 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine structure. The first system consists of a triplet (H-3′/5′, 2H), doublet (H-2′/6′, 2H) and triplet (H-4′, 1H) in the range δ 7.50–7.25 ppm, corresponding to the five protons of the 2-phenoxy moiety. The second one corresponds to the three protons of the pyridine-ring (H-6, H-7 and H-8), mostly in the form of two doublets (H-8 & H-6) and a double of doublets (H-7) in the range of δ 8.9–7.5 ppm (see the experimental data). This main structure of phenoxy-pyrido-triazolopyrimidine was also clearly interpretable from its 12 characteristic 13C-resonances, including five resonances of the fused pyrido ring, four of the phenoxy moiety along with the characteristic three signals of C-2, C-3a and C-5. The successful synthesis of the different groups of products (1; 2a–l; 3; 4; 5 and 6a–i) was separately supported by the characteristic splitting patterns, δ and J values of the newly added moieties (alkyl or aryl) in the corresponding 1H and 13C NMR spectra. In addition, the change of structural features among all groups was mainly validated in the form of different δ values for the C-5 due to its structural change from C=O (1 & 2a–l) to C=S (3), C-S-R (4), C–Cl (5) or C–NHR (6a–i) (see the experimental data).
To explore the potential biological activity of the synthesized pyrimidine fused derivatives (1–6), in vitro screening of α-glucosidase inhibition was performed. The enzyme was treated with equal concentrations (100 µg/mL) of each compound. The test was repeated three times for each compound and the average percent inhibition was obtained. The inhibitory activity of all the tested compounds was between 30% and 63%. The eight compounds (out of the 25 tested) that exhibited more than 50% of the average percent inhibition were further evaluated and their IC50 values compared to that of acarbose. Compounds 3, 6c and 6d showed average percent inhibition of more than 60%. On the other hand, compounds 2a, 2d, 6a, 6b and 6h showed average percent inhibition of more than 50% but less than 60%.
In this study, we demonstrated that the introduction of a branch to the pyrimidine scaffold through a nitrogen bridge results in a series of synthetic compounds with significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase. The open site available for N-substitution at the fused pyrido-triazolo-pyrimidine rings is on the nitrogen at position 4. However, these derivatives did not exhibit any inhibitory activity except for compounds 2a and 2d. This suggests that the derivatization site has no significant effect on the inhibitory activity. The average percent inhibitions of 2a and 2d were 50.36% and 57.48%, respectively. The replacement of the carbonyl group of the pyrimidinone with amino-bridged substitutes resulted in the production of compounds 6a–6i. Compounds 6a–d and 6h exhibited average percent inhibition of more than 50% (Fig. 3). The comparison between the average percent inhibition of compounds 6a–6i and 2a–2l suggests that the amino-bridge substitution of the pyrimidine ring at position 4 is responsible for the strong inhibitory activity.
The pharmaceutical parameters of promising inhibitors, including the corresponding IC50 values, were calculated. Acarbose, a commonly used antidiabetic drug due to its inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, was used as positive control. Compound 3 at a concentration of 100 µg/mL exhibited good activity against α-glucosidase enzyme (60.38%). Instead, products derivatized at position 4 has displayed weak inhibitory activity. Only two N-alkylated derivatives (ethyl and 2-methylbenzyl) showed more than 50% average percent inhibition (50.36% and 57.48%, respectively). The IC50 values of these compounds followed a similar trend; the IC50 of compound 3 was 167.82 µM and those of compound 2a and 2d were 304.13 µM and 173.83 µM, respectively (Fig. 4).
On the other hand, the replacement of the chloro group in 5 by different nucleophiles provided derivatives with similar or lower IC50 values than that of acarbose. This is exemplified by compounds 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d and 6h. The rank order of potency according to the IC50 values, including acarbose is 6h ˃ 6d ˃ acarbose ˃ 6a ˃ 6c ˃ 6b. The 2-methoxy-benzyl-methanimine (6h; IC50 = 104.07 µM) and 4-ethoxy-aniline (6d; IC50 = 138.66 µM) substituted derivatives exhibit the best activity when compared to acarbose (IC50 = 143.54 µM). The IC50 values of the amino substituted derivatives ranked as aniline ˃ 4-methoxy-aniline ˃ 4-methyl-aniline. While the IC50 value was slightly reduced by the parent aniline compound 6a (IC50 = 154.12 µM), the 4-methyl-aniline and 4-methoxy-aniline derivatives showed IC50 values of 207.19 and 176.89 µM, respectively.
To understand the observed α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds, molecular docking calculations were performed to study the binding modes of the target enzyme and docked synthesized derivatives. Therefore, the number of established intermolecular hydrogen bonds, binding energies of stable ligand-α-glucosidase complexes and number of closest amino acid residues surrounding the binding site of the α-glucosidase enzyme were determined for the synthesized compounds (Table 1 and Fig. 5).
All the synthesized derivatives formed a complex with the target enzyme. The relative standard deviation of the binding energy of the formed complex was less than 2.34 kcal/mol. From Table 1 and Fig. 5, it can be assumed that the maximal inhibition activity of compound 6h is mainly attributable to its binding energy and the stability of the ligand-α-glucosidase complex. Thus, the binding energy of docked 6h was found to be the lowest (− 10.55 kcal/mol) among the energies of the docked derivatives (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Compounds 6a and 6b differ from compound 6h only at the substitution at the amino group (phenyl-, 4-Me-phenyl and N-(2-methoxy benzyl)methanimine, respectively; Fig. 2). The inhibitory activity of compound 6a was higher than that of 6b, and this is may be ascribed to the higher stability of the 6a-α-glucosidase complex (binding energy = − 9.76 kcal/mol) than the 6b-α-glucosidase complex (binding energy = − 9.42 kcal/mol). The number of established hydrogen bonds can be invoked by the reference drug acarbose. The inhibition activity of acarbose correlates with the number hydroxyl groups and the number of the established hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the active site of the α-glucosidase enzyme (Fig. 5). Acarbose can establish 10 hydrogen bonds with Asp232, Ala234, Asn237, Asp357, Arg552, Asp568 and His626. Moreover, two hydrophobic interactions are observed between the methyl group of the deoxyglucosamine moiety and residues Phe601 and Trp329. Although compound 2a can interact with 10 residues at the active site, it can only form one hydrogen bond between the nitrogen group on the triazole ring and Arg552. However, this binding is not stable and provides a free binding energy of − 8.12 kcal/mol. Instead, three residues appear to interact with compound 6h, Ala234, Arg552 and Asp469, to which 6h can establish hydrogen bonds. These three hydrogen bonds enhance the ligand-α-glucosidase complex stability and reduce the free binding energy of compound 6h to − 10.55 kcal/mol. Trp329 can also form hydrophobic bonds with compounds 2a and 6h as in the case of acarbose, which is responsible for the binding conformation of the compounds in the active site.
We have prepared twenty-five compounds containing fused pyrimidine, pyrido and triazole rings. The synthesized compounds were characterized and subjected to α-glycosidase inhibitory assay. Six promising compounds that showed more than 50% of the average percent inhibition were subjected to further assays to determine their IC50. Acarbose was used as reference drug to compare with the synthesized compounds. Compounds 6d and 6h showed a significant inhibitory activity against α-glycosidase with lower IC50 values than that of acarbose. Molecular docking studies were performed and showed that the number of established intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the binding energies of the stable ligand-α-glucosidase complexes and the number of closest amino acid residues surrounding the binding site are responsible for the inhibitory activity of compound 6h, which is higher than that of acarbose. Moreover, Trp329 plays a significant role in directing the ligand in the binding site of the α-glucosidase enzyme. This study provides a new structural insight for the development of novel α-glucosidase inhibitors, which differ from the commonly employed carbasugars, and which can eventually be transformed into new clinical drugs for the treatment of type II diabetes.

 Indole based thiadiazole derivatives (1–22) have synthesized, characterized by NMR and HREI-MS and evaluated for β-Glucuronidase inhibition. All compounds showed outstanding β-glucuronidase activity with IC50 values ranging between 0.5 ± 0.08 to 38.9 ± 0.8 µM when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone (IC50 value of 48.1 ± 1.2 µM). The compound 6, a 2,3-dihydroxy analog was found the most potent among the series with IC50 value 0.5 ± 0.08 µM. Structure activity relationship has been established for all compounds. To confirm the binding interactions of these newly synthesized compounds, molecular docking study have been carried out which reveal that these compounds established stronger hydrogen bonding networks with active site residues.

β-Glucuronidases enzymes belong to family glycoside hydrolase GH1, GH2 and GH79, and reduce glucuronic acid sugar moiety from non-reducing termini. It has been used in disease diagnosis, gene manipulation and food industry. Recently it has drawn more attention to enhance the efficacy by modifying natural glucuronides [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. β-Glucuronidase present in microsomes and lysosomes and eliminate from body through urinary track . Activity of β-glucuronidase increases in many diseases like AIDS, inflammation, cancer and hepatic disease . Cholelithiasis is originated in human bile due to endogenous biliary β-glucuronidase which is related with deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronidase . Increase level of this enzyme is associated with some urinary disorder like active pyelonephritis, cancer of kidney bladder and acute renal necrosis . β-Glucuronidase in humane has resulted in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome), which is characterized by growth of glycosaminoglycans in cells of most tissues [10, 11]. Indole is an important class of compounds with wide range of application in medicinal chemistry [12, 13]. Variety of compounds having indole is the basic unit possesses antitumor applications [14, 15]. Many compounds containing indole scaffold have effect in many physiological processes. Indole with 5-HT receptor activity as agonist and antagonist is the most recent synthetic interest in medicinal chemistry [16, 17].
The thiadiazole skeleton constitutes an important central template for a wide variety of biologically active compounds, having many pharmacological applications 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole and certain structurally related compounds have been known for 50 years to have antitumor activity . Compounds of this class are uricogenic agents in man . Both the antitumor and the uricogenic activities can be prevented or reversed by nicotinamide [20, 21]. Variety of thiadiazole derivatives possess interesting biological activities and are of great interest to chemist . Many bioactive molecules in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals contained thiadiazole moiety [23, 24, 25]. Thiadiazole derivatives biological applications include antibacterial, anticonvulsant, anti-leishmanial, anticancer, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tuberculosis [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. The indole and related heterocyclic compounds have also great importance in the field of chemistry .
Keeping in view the great biological potential of indole and thiadiazole analogs here in this study we have planned to synthesize the hybrid molecules of indole based thiadiazole derivatives with the hope that it may showed greater potential. After evaluation for biological potential we have found outstanding results which support our previous hypothesis. Here we are reporting synthesis of indole based thiadiazole derivatives, its characterization, β-glucuronidase inhibition and molecular docking studies.
A series of indole based thiadiazole were synthesized by refluxing ethyl 1H-indole-5-carboxylate (a) with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol for 2 h to afford 1H-indole-5-carbohydrazide (b) refluxed with Lawesson’s reagent in toluene yielded corresponding thio-analogue (c). Thiohydrazide (c) was then treated with various aryl aldehydes to form cyclized adducts 1–22 (Table 1) in the presence of POCl3 (Scheme 1). Upon completion of reaction (monitored with TLC), product was recrystallized from methanol and purified by washing. Spectral data including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HREI-MS for all synthesized compounds were recorded.
In the continuation of our effort for enzyme inhibition , we have synthesized series of indole based thiadiazole derivatives, a new class of β-glucuronidase inhibitors. All the compounds (1–22) were screened for β-glucuronidase activity. All the compounds showed outstanding inhibition when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone with IC50 value 48.1 ± 1.2 µM (Table 1). Structure activity relationship (SAR) has been established mainly based on the substitution pattern on phenyl ring attached to thiadiazole. The compound 6, a 2,3-dihydroxy analog was found the most potent among the series with IC50 value 0.5 ± 0.08 µM. The greater potential shown by this compound is seems mainly due to the hydroxyl group on phenyl ring which might be involve in hydrogen bonding with the active site of enzyme. If we compare analog 6 with other dihydroxy substituted analogs like 5, a 2,5-dihydroxy analog (IC50 = 1.82 ± 0.01 µM), 7, a 3,4-dihydroxy analog (IC50 = 1.1 ± 0.08 µM), and 8, a 2,4-dihydroxy analog (IC50 = 2.30 ± 0.1 µM), the analog 6 is superior. The slight difference in the potential of these analogs is seems due to the difference in position of substituent. The mono-hydroxy analogs like 3, a 2-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 3.1 ± 0.01 µM), 4, a 3-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 7.1 ± 0.05 µM), 9, a 4-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 5.3 ± 0.1 µM) and 13, a 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy analog (IC50 = 12.3 ± 0.3 µM) also showed outstanding potential. The dihydroxy analogs are superior when mono-hydroxy analogs. The reason for greater potential of dihydroxy analogs is mainly due to greater number of hydroxyl group. This shows that number of hydroxyl group also paly critical role in this inhibition. In nitro substituted analogs like 10, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 24.38 ± 0.3 µM) is predominating over 11, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 35.30 ± 0.5 µM) and 12, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 28.2 1 ± 0.4 µM) which shows that position of substituent plays an important role. Similar pattern was also observed in other substituted analog like flouro analogs 18, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 4.6 ± 0.2 µM) with 19, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 9.9 ± 0.4 µM) and 20, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 6.2 ± 0.3 µM) and chloro substituted analogs like compound 21, a 4-chloro analog (12.0 ± 0.30 µM) is more potent than 22, a 4-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.28 ± 0.3 µM)and 15, a 3-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.8 ± 0.3 µM). It was concluded form this study that position, nature and number of substituents on phenyl ring plays a critical in this inhibition.
The concentration inhibition IC50 values of thiadiazole synthesized derivatives as β-glucoronidase inhibitors are presented in (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the inhibitory potency of the tilted compounds depends mainly on the type, number and positions of the functional group in the substitute group R of the synthesized derivatives. According to inhibitory IC50 values (Table 1), the synthesized derivatives may be subdivided into highly active group with low IC50 values (e.g., 6, 7, 3), moderate active group (e.g., 4, 9, 20) and low active group (e.g., 1, 2). For a better understanding of the observed results and to rationalize the highest activity of 6 compared to 4, and the low activity of 1 with regards to 4, molecular docking study has been carried out to shed light on the established binding modes of the three chosen synthesized compounds 6, 4 and 1 to the closest residues in the active site of β-glucoronidase enzyme. Table 2 summarized the calculated binding energies of the stable complexes ligand- β-glucoronidase, number of established intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the synthesized compounds (1, 4 and 6) and active site residues of β-glucoronidase.
As can be seen from the docking results shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1, the highest activity of synthesized compound 6 compared to low active compounds 4 and 1 is mainly return to (ii) the stability of the formed complex between the docked compounds and β-glucoronidase, and the (ii) number of hydrogen bonding established between the docked ligands and the active site residues of the β-glucoronidase. However, it can be concluded that the number of closest residues to the docked ligands where all of them are surrounded by almost the same number of residues into the active site (Table 2 and Fig. 1) has no effect on the observed activities. Indeed, the formed complex between 6 and β-glucoronidase has the lowest binding energy of − 8.6 kcal/mol compared to 4 and 1 with binding energies of the stables complexes between the two compound and β-glucoronidase are of − 8.3 and − 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2). In addition, four hydrogen bonding are established between residues of β-glucoronidase and compound 6 into the active site (Fig. 1c). The strongest hydrogen bond is formed between GLU45 amino acid and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of catechol moiety of a 6 with distance of 1.66 Å. The second hydrogen bond is relatively weaker than the first one and is established between hydrogen atom of hydroxyl of catechol oxygen in ortho position of catechol group and GLU287 with a distance of 2.2 Å. The two other hydrogen bonds are relatively weak than the previous ones. The first one is established between ASN80 amino acid and the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of catechol moiety of 6 with a distance of 2.82 Å. The second one is established between HIS327 and hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of catechol moiety of 6 with a distance of 2.96 Å. In a similar way, the higher activity of 4 compared to 1 may be explained by the above effects (i) and (ii) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For instance, the complex formed between 4 and β-glucoronidase has a binding energy of − 8.3 kcal/mol and two hydrogen bonding of distance 1.95 Å, which are formed between amino acids ASP105 and TYR243 and hydrogen of NH and hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of phenol group of 4, respectively. While, for the synthesized compound 1, the formed complex has energy binding of − 7.7 kcal/mol, and only one hydrogen bond that is formed between HIS241 amino acids and NH group of compound 1.
NMR experiments were performed on Avance Bruker AM 300 MHz machine. Electron impact mass spectra (EI MS) were recorded on a Finnigan MAT-311A (Germany) mass spectrometer. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated silica gel aluminum plates (Kieselgel 60, 254, E. Merck, Germany). Chromatograms were visualized by UV at 254 and 365 nm.
The interaction binding modes between the active site residues of β-glucoronidase and docked synthesized indole derivatives have been carried out using Autodock package [37, 38, 39]. X-ray coordinates of β-glucoronidase and the originated docked ligand N-alkyl cyclophellitol aziridine were downloaded from the RCSB data bank web site (PDB code 5G0Q) [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Water molecules were removed; polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charge were added to the extracted receptor structure by using the automated tool in AutoDock Tools 4.2. The active site is identified based on co-crystallized receptor-ligand complex structure of β-glucoronidase. The re-docking of the original ligand N-alkyl cyclophellitol aziridine into the active site is well reproduced with a RMSD value less than 2 Å. The molecular structures geometries of indole synthesized derivatives were minimized at Merck molecular force field 94 (MMFF94) level 44. The optimized structures were saved as pdb files. Nonpolar hydrogens were merged and rotatable bonds were defined for each docked ligand. Docking studies were performed by Lamarckian genetic algorithm, with 500 as total number of run for binding site for originated ligand and 100 run for the synthesized derivatives. In each respective run, a population of 150 individuals with 27,000 generations and 250,000 energy evaluations were employed. Operator weights for crossover, mutation, and elitism were set to 0.8, 0.02, and 1, respectively. The binding site was defined using a grid of 40 × 40 × 40 points each with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. The docking calculation have been carried out using an Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz workstation (Additional file 1).
Thiadiazole derivatives 1–22 were synthesized by refluxing ethyl 1H-indole-5-carboxylate (a) with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol for 2 h to afford 1H-indole-5-carbohydrazide (b) refluxed with Lawesson’s reagent in toluene yielded corresponding thio-analogue (c). Thiohydrazide (c) was then treated with various aryl aldehydes to form cyclized adducts 1–22.

In conclusion we have synthesized 22 derivatives of indole based thiadiazole hybrid analogs due to greater biological importance of indole and thiadiazole and evaluated for β-glucuronidase inhibition. All compounds showed outstanding β-glucuronidase activity ranging between 0.5 ± 0.08 to 38.9 ± 0.8 µM when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone. Structure activity relationship has been established for all compounds which reveal that the number, nature and position of substituents on phenyl ring play of thiadiazole play a vital role in this inhibition. Molecular docking study have been performed which revealed that these compounds established stronger hydrogen bonding networks with active site residues.
NBA synthesized all compounds and wrote experimental part of manuscript. MT supervised the work and help in characterizing compounds. MG supported computational work and revised manuscript. FR helped in purifying compounds and manuscript writing. MI helped in bioassay work and writing SAR of all compounds. AM helped in calculating IC50 and deeply analyzing bioactivity. EHA performed Molecular docking study and helped in writing manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

  of test compounds (important when working with a large chemical library), is readily miscible with water and cell culture media, and has a high boiling point (this improves the accuracy of test compound concentrations by reducing room temperature evaporation). One limitation with DMSO is that it can affect cell line growth and viability (with low DMSO concentrations sometimes stimulating cell growth, and high DMSO concentrations sometimes inhibiting or killing cells). DMSO is used as a vehicle in in vivo studies of test compounds too. It has, for example, been employed as a co-solvent to assist absorption of the flavonol glycoside Icariin in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. As with its use in in

 5 grams of mercury(II) oxide (HgO) is dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water. The mixture is slowly stirred, while 20 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid is added. After adding another 40 mL of distilled water, the solution is stirred until the HgO is completely dissolved. ; The Denigés' reagent can also be prepared by dissolving 5 grams of HgO in 20 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and 100 mL of distilled water. ; The Denigés' reagent can be modified by using nitric acid in place of sulfuric acid Despite the different stoichiometry in these mixtures which varies the concentration of the reagent, they all follow the same idea of adding HgO to distilled water and concentrated sulfuric acid. The Denigés' reagent is ultimately mercury(II) sulfate in an aqueous solution.
