Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate 17% (or 12.7 million) of today’s youth (between 2-19 yrs.) are now considered obese (2). Health related consequences of childhood obesity include increased incidents of high cholesterol, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, joint/bone problems and poor self-esteem (1). Consequently, children who are obese are more likely to remain obese as adults, perpetuating the obesity epidemic (3). A desirable BMI for an adult is between 18.5 and 24.9. Scientific evidence indicates the risk for chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and type 2 diabetes increases with a BMI of 25 or greater (4). A child’s BMI score is determined in a slightly different manner than an adult’s BMI. A child’s BMI score is calculated using a specific percentile of BMI based on the child’s age and gender instead of the same BMI categories used for adults because a child’s body composition fluctuates as they grow. Growth charts from the CDC (http://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx) are then used to determine a child’s BMI. Childhood obesity prevalence is not equal among all ethnicities or socioeconomic classes. Obesity rates are higher among Hispanics (22.4%) and non-Hispanic black youth (20.2%) than non-Hispanic white youth (14.1%) (2). The occurrence of obesity is lowest among non-Hispanic Asian youth (8.6%) (2). In addition, childhood obesity is less common in which the head of household has completed a college degree and the household income is above the poverty line. According to the CDC, “Overall, obesity prevalence among children whose adult head of household completed college was approximately half that of those whose adult head of household did not complete high school (9% vs 19% among girls; 11% vs 21% among boys) in 1999–2010” (2). Instead they are spending increasing amounts of time engaged in sedentary behaviors such as watching television, using computers, and playing video games. The end result is inactive, unhealthy, and obese children, particularly when combined with poor dietary habits. Speaking of poor dietary habits, research demonstrates that adolescents are drinking more soda (filled with calories and sugar) and eating less fruits and vegetables (4). Children and adolescents are also consuming too much sodium and do not meet guidelines for whole grain consumption (4). Whole grains, milk, and fruits and vegetables are being replaced with junk food, fast food and soda filled with sugar, saturated fats and excess calories. First, a child’s weight status is determined using a percentile of BMI, rather than BMI itself. There’s more to the issue than obesity, in fact this article highlights an important facet we may overlook if we aren’t focusing on everything children need to grow up healthy! http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html. http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm.

Obesity in the United Kingdom is a significant contemporary health concern, with authorities stating that it is one of the leading preventable causes of death. In February 2016, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described rising rates of childhood obesity as a \"national emergency\". Data from the Health Survey for England (HSE) conducted in 2018 indicated that 31% of adults in the England were recognised as clinically obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30. 63% of adults were classified as overweight or obese (a body mass index of 25 or above), compared to 53% in 1993. More than two-thirds of men and 6 in 10 women were overweight or obese. 15% of children aged between 2 and 15 years (inclusive) were obese and an additional 13% of children were overweight. Rising levels of obesity are a major challenge to public health. There are expected to be \n\n Being overweight or obese increases the risk of illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, as well as some forms of cancer. In the United Kingdom, obesity and a BMI of 30 to 35 has been found to reduce life expectancy by an average of three years, while a BMI of over 40 reduced longevity by eight to 10 years. According to a report published by the Commons Health Select Committee in November 2015, treating obesity related medical conditions costs the National Health Service (NHS) £5 billion a year and has a wider cost to the economy \n\n Dietary factors are recognized as having a significant effect on the risk of cancers, with different dietary elements both increasing and reducing risk. Diet and obesity may be related to up to 30-35% of cancer deaths, while physical inactivity appears to be related to 7% risk of cancer occurrence. Obesity and drinking alcohol have been correlated with the incidence and progression of some cancers. A diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat has been implicated but not confirmed, and the effect may be small for well-nourished people \n\nThe field of medicine is filled with tons of complex and confusing medical terms. You’ve likely heard one of those terms — the abbreviation BMI — during a doctor’s appointment or even in the news. Think of this as your comprehensive guide to all things BMI. BMI is a common measure of body weight, and most medical professionals use BMI to categorize people as having a normal weight, being overweight, or being obese. The CDC warns that BMI shouldn’t be used to define body fat or diagnose health conditions. (3) Rather, if you have a high or low BMI, your physician may have you undergo additional health screenings, such as for high cholesterol or high blood pressure. In young adults, obesity may even be to blame for an increase in rates of colorectal, endometrial, gallbladder, kidney, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer, according to an analysis of data published in February 2019 in The Lancet Public Health. If you live in the United States and don’t use the metric system, you can also take your height in inches squared, divide that by your weight in pounds, and multiply by 703. Your child’s pediatrician will usually calculate his or her BMI when he or she is around age 2 or 3. But instead of following BMI ranges for adults, doctors screen children, adolescents, and teenagers for obesity using what’s called growth chart percentages, which use percentiles. A child between age 2 and 18 is considered overweight when the BMI is between the 85th and 94th percentile. A child in that same age range is considered obese if the BMI is at or greater than the 95th percentile. If your child needs to lower his or her BMI, consider approaching the topic by discussing lifestyle changes across the family unit rather than addressing your child’s weight loss directly. What we know for sure, at least on an observational level, is that BMI correlates with obesity-related conditions, says Jessica Crandall, RDN, the general manager of Denver Wellness and Nutrition Center–Sodexo in Colorado, and a national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. What Are the Risk Factors for Having a High BMI? A high BMI is related to a high body weight and excessive body fat. A low intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a higher body weight because the energy density of these foods is lower than in other foods. On the other hand, high fat and sugar intake is associated with a higher BMI because the density of those foods is higher than that of fruits and veggies. (21,22,23,24) As mentioned, having a high BMI can take a toll on your health, so it's no surprise that the more you sit and the less you move, the greater your risk for early death and chronic disease, per an article published in November 2018 in JAMA. Remember that BMI is a calculation using your weight and your height. Adults who need to decrease their BMI must lose weight, because their height is fixed. But in general, eating more low-calorie, high-fiber foods such as nonstarchy vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains is a tried-and-true way to help lower your body weight. Think 10-10-2,300 for these food groups: added sugars less than 10 percent of your total calorie intake, saturated fat less than 10 percent, and sodium less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day. The fact that BMI paints a picture of only a portion of a person’s health has drawn criticism from some health professionals. Although BMI takes your weight and height into account, it doesn’t consider other factors that are known to affect disease risk, such as high blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. She adds that it’s important for physicians to assess factors like muscle mass, activity level, and nutrition when determining how healthy or unhealthy a person is. Adult Obesity Facts.

According to a 2019 survey conducted by the Arab Barometer, 8% of respondents considered honor killings acceptable, compared to 6% who accepted homosexuality.

The country is a major manufacturer and exporter of photovoltaics (PV) and a large installer of domestic PV systems, with most of them grid connected. Japan has a solar irradiance of about 4.3 to 4.8 kWh/(m2·day). Solar power has become an important national priority since the country's shift in policies toward renewable energy after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. Japan was the world's second largest market for solar PV growth in 2013 and 2014, adding a record 6.97 GW and 9.74 GW of nominal nameplate capacity, respectively. By the end of 2017, cumulative capacity reached 50 GW, the world's second largest solar PV installed capacity, behind China. In 2018, China saw a decrease in annual solar energy, dropping down to 44.4 GW. In 2019, annual solar energy installation further dropped to 30.1 GW, even lower than the installations made in 2016. This decline in growth is attributed to the Chinese government restructuring government incentives to start solar energy projects in May 2018.

According to 2018 data, share of gross domestic products rose to 10.9% of GDP, overtaking the OECD average of 8.8%. In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2025.

These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present, it is also known as dysentery. Diarrhea can be prevented by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding for at least six months and vaccination against rotavirus is also recommended. Most cases, however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.26 million in 2013—down from 2.58 million in 1990. In 2012, it was the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions (Cl–). It continues even when there is no oral food intake. Osmotic Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. Osmotic diarrhea can also result from maldigestion, e.g. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent, e.g. This occurs with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and other severe infections such as E. coli or other forms of food poisoning. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases.

Health effects Diarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development. \"Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults,\" and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition. Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration.

Diarrhea is no joke, especially if your liquid stools are mixed with blood, pus, and slime. Worldwide, Diarrheal disease is the second-leading cause of death in children under the age of five (after pneumonia). Some Diarrheal diseases also spread from person to person where hygiene is poor. Pathogens cause diarrhea in a number of ways.These latter mechanisms are invariably violent and tend to produce bloody diarrhea or even dysentery in which diarrhea features the aforementioned blood, mucus and pus (shigellosis).The good news, if you can call it that, is that as many as 1 in 4 people infected with a Diarrheal pathogen do not develop symptoms.The bad news: they act as carriers and pass on infection to others.

Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Acute diarrhea is most commonly due to viral gastroenteritis with rotavirus, which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five. In travelers, however, bacterial infections predominate. Various toxins such as mushroom poisoning and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea. Infections There are many causes of infectious diarrhea, which include viruses, bacteria and parasites. Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in adults, but rotavirus is the most common cause in children under five years old. Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, such as E coli o157:h7, are the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the United\n\nDiarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose, liquid, or watery bowel movements each day. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacterium, or parasite—a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present, it is also known as dysentery. Diarrhea can be prevented by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding for at least six months and vaccination against rotavirus is also recommended. Most cases, however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Antibiotics, while rarely used, may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.26 million in 2013—down from 2.58 million in 1990. In 2012, it was the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions (Cl–). It continues even when there is no oral food intake. Osmotic Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. Osmotic diarrhea can also result from maldigestion, e.g. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent, e.g. This occurs with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and other severe infections such as E. coli or other forms of food poisoning. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.

In regions of the world that lack clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene, the opportunity to improve poor health is extremely difficult. Unsafe water can transmit bacterial, viral and parasitic infections such as: cholera, typhoid, hepatitis E and hookworm. These illnesses can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, anemia, and hypertension; each has the potential to increase maternal mortality and contribute to possible complications. Hand washing by birth attendants and mothers alone was found to increase newborn survival by 44%. For mothers who do not breast feed, clean water is crucial to ensure safe formula/food preparation-treatment of water can take hours of a day away from other productive activities. In a limited-resource environment, the risks of not having clean water or proper sanitation and hygiene are significant. 15% of all maternal deaths are caused by infections in the six weeks following delivery and are due to unhygienic practices and poor infection control during labor and delivery. Before birth, water, sanitation and hygiene indirectly influence the health of a child by directly affecting the health of its mother; once born, the effects of unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene directly affect the health of the child. 3.3 million neo-natal deaths (before 28 days old) are attributed to sepsis caused by unhygienic practices during birth. Approximately 88% of all diarrhea cases are related to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. Access to clean water and adequate sanitation is a violation of a basic human right. But at present, 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, while 884 million lack access to safe drinking water. Clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene help a woman provide a stable and healthy environment for her child, before and after birth. Lacking clean water and sanitation adversely affects maternal and child health outcomes and perpetuates poor health outcomes, low educational attainment, poverty and preventable death within populations that are in great need of improved health and economic stability. Societies must acknowledge the need of clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene as vital to the health and well-being of women and children and a key to improved community health. Most people, when asked to think about deadly and debilitative diseases rife in the developing world, would jump immediately to Malaria. This would be a logical conclusion, as of course Malaria is an infamous killer, and is responsible for about 450,000 deaths a year. They are a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases that cause substantial illness for over one billion of the world’s poorest people. They are unfamiliar diseases to most, including names such as Elephantitis, River Blindness, Snail Fever, Trachoma and Hookworm. Thriving in communities that lack access to health services, adequate sanitation and clean water, NTDs impair physical and cognitive development, contribute to mother and child illness and death, and make it difficult to farm or make a living. They trap individuals, families and whole communities in a cycle of poverty and disease, as well as costing developing economies billions of dollars a year. Despite assistance from a number of additional donor organisations however, there continues to be a funding gap that leaves millions of people at risk of contracting these diseases. In May 2013, the 66th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted resolution WHA66.12 which urged member states to begin to take ownership of NTD programmes (particularly those affecting their own countries, such as in South America and China), to intensify and integrate measures and plan investments to improve the health and social wellbeing of affected populations. This indicator had been requested by the WHO, and was supported by the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases. Target 3.3 of the SDGs reads: “by 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases, and other communicable diseases.” With this set target, there will be more incentives for programmatic and political support for treatment programs, and will increase our chances of reaching these goals. It is clear that despite our best efforts thus far, more needs to be done in order to eradicate NTDs. Our governments working in cooperation with multilateral institutions, businesses and not-for-profit organisations do have the real possibility of fulfilling the SDG commitment to eradicating NTDs for good before 2013. In 2015, 67% of the total population had access to \"at least basic water supply\". In 2015, around 60 million people lacked access to \"at least basic\" water. As for sanitation, only 33% of the total population had access to \"at least basic\" sanitation. Approximately 122 million people still lacked access to \"at least basic\" sanitation. A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of \n\nThe global use of antibiotics is growing, driven by a number of developing countries that face more antibiotic-resistant infections. University of Oxford’s Abhilasha Karkey explains the link between antibiotic use and having access to clean water. One obstacle I often see as a medical microbiologist working in developing countries, is a lack of access to clean water, which makes preventing and controlling infections nearly impossible. It is a major driver of inappropriate antibiotic use and, ultimately, the growth in antibiotic-resistant bugs—so-called “superbugs”. Before we got to the door of the emergency department, we could smell the problem: gangrene. By the time we saw him, the only thing we could do was refer him to the nearest hospital—a two-hour flight away—for an amputation. While water scarcity in California and Cape Town makes headlines, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF report that 2.1 billion people lack access to a safe and sustainable water supply. Around 40 per cent of health care facilities in developing countries do not have a water supply. This is why the water crisis is a health crisis. Having access to safe water and sanitation is central to improving health and fighting diseases that are increasingly resistant to treatments, such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery. One of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is to ensure access to sustainable water and sanitation for all people by 2030. Despite the resolution, water scarcity has spread rapidly to many parts of the world as population and consumption levels have increased against a fixed supply of renewable fresh water. These shortages lead to sanitation and hygiene problems and, as a result, foster a high number of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, gastroenteritis and cholera. Having access to safe water and sanitation is central to improving health and fighting diseases that are increasingly resistant to treatments, such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery. Several health issues such as mortality rate, epidemics of diseases, drug abuse, sexual and reproductive health have been existed throughout the decade. A number of neglected tropical diseases including buruli ulcer, chagas disease, cysticercosis, dengue fever, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, fascioliasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma and others are prevalent in low to middle income countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America (CDC, 2011; Global Network, 2015; londonntd, 2016). Intervention measures such as mass treatment, individual treatment and cure, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), vector control and veterinary public health have been taken against neglected tropical diseases and national elimination of NTDs was achieved by 50 countries in 2014(WHO,2016). More than 5.9 million children under 5 years old died in 2015 and target 3.2 of UN sustainable development goals aims to achieve under 5 mortality rate as low as 25 per 1000 live births by 2030 (WHO,2016). Environmental hazards and pollution are causing significant health damages. Water, air, and soil pollution caused about 40 percent deaths worldwide (Lang, 2007). Approximately 6.5 million deaths have been attributed to household and ambient air pollution in 2012 (UN, 2016). Reducing the deaths and injuries caused by hazardous chemicals and environmental pollution by 2030 is one of the key targets of UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Growing population and aging infrastructure are creating challenges for efficient water management in cities (NRDC, 2016). Groundwater decline is major problem across the cities relying on groundwater as a source of drinking water. Declining levels of groundwater have been assessed in cities such as Barcelona, Houston, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York, Rome, many large cities in China, Libya, India and Pakistan and Middle East and Central Asian regions in a study using global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB (Sutanudaja and Erkems, 2016). A positive effect of urbanization on groundwater includes increases in recharge by water-mains leakage, waste water seepage, storm-water soakaways and excess garden irrigation. However, contamination from in-situ sanitation, sewer leakage, industrial chemical pollution and disposal of liquid effluents and solid wastes are pitfalls of urbanisation (IAH, 2015). Increasing water demand, higher rate of water abstraction and rapid urbanization might induce effects such as induced seepage of contaminated water, land subsidence and coastal saline intrusion (IAH, 2015).

In 2014, the country will host the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Games are scheduled to be held two years later. Brazil is undoubtedly an enticing prospect for companies seeking to expand and broaden their audience and an exciting market to watch. During 2011 alone, the Internet population grew by 16% (comScore ) with IAB Brazil estimating a total Brazilian online audience at more than 81m people (aged 16+). The number of mobile subscriptions, however, dwarfs these figures at 240 million as we entered 2012 (GSMA ). The study found that a significant proportion of older homeless adults owned a mobile phone, with 76% of participants reporting ownership. However, smartphone ownership was lower, with only 38% of participants indicating that they owned a smartphone. In terms of internet and computer use, the study found that 71% of older homeless adults reported using the internet regularly, and 60% reported using a computer. Among those who used the internet, the most common activities were checking emails, looking up health information, and searching for jobs.

World Health Organization (WHO) TB statistics reports for the year 2015 points out estimated incidence of TB for India is around 2.2 million cases out of a global incidence of 9.6 million with more than 2 million new cases every year Monitoring treatment response, treatment adherence, maintaining records for all TB patients, public health responsibility, notification of TB cases, health education are quite few important guidelines the National TB programme implements on TB patients in India as per the recommendations of World Health Organization(WHO) [1,2]. Increasing penetration of smart phones among common people because of its lowering cost and the proliferation of high speed mobile networks and services available at cheaper prices the smart phone based mHealth solution will play a far greater role in healthcare in both developed and developing countries in the future [6-8]. India accounts for one fourth of the global TB burden. India has highest burden of both TB and MDR TB based on estimates reported in Global TB Report 2016. India bears second highest number of estimated HIV associated TB in the world. With a rise in smart phone ownership globally, China will have highest number of smart phone users, 1.3 billion, in 2018, followed by India with 530 million users. The US will be a distant third, with 229 million users. According to a new study by US-based media agency Zenith, smart phone ownership globally will continue to expand in 2018. The agency said that 66 per cent of individuals in 52 countries will own a smart phone in 2018 – up from 63 per cent in 2017. India currently has in between 300-400 million smart phone users. There are about 650 million mobile phone users in India, and just over 300 million of them have a smart phone, according to Counterpoint Research. Two out of three Indian mobile users – or roughly 433 million people are planning to upgrade their phones in the next year. The number of internet users in India is expected to reach 450-465 million, said a recent from the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and market research firm IMRB International. The report said overall internet penetration in India is currently around 31 per cent. In this paper we propose a\n\n India has the second highest number of internet users in the world. The following table provides an overview of internet subscriber statistics in India as on 30 June 2021. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that about 60% of Indian internet users viewed vernacular content and only about a quarter of internet users were over the age of 35 years in 2019. The WEF also estimated that 1.1 billion Indians would have access to the internet by 2030, with 80% of the subscriber base primarily accessing the internet on mobile devices. The profile of India's internet user base was predicted to diversify by 2030 with 80% of users accessing vernacular content and with users over 25 years making up 45% of the total subscriber base. Access \n\n India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. In 2020, the average age of an Indian is 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4. However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining. There are significant issues affecting young people around education in India, although in many respects this is a success story. Other persistent problems include child labour in India, malnutrition in India, street children in India, child marriage in India, child trafficking in India and others. According to StatCounter web use statistics (a proxy for all use), in the week from 7–13 November 2016, \"mobile\" (meaning smartphones) alone (without tablets) overtook desktop for the first time and by the end of the year smartphones were in the majority. Since 27 October, the desktop has not shown a majority, even on weekdays. Previously, according to StatCounter press release, the world has turned into a desktop-minority;, there was about 49% of desktop usage for that month. The two biggest continents, Asia and Africa, have been a mobile-majority for a while, and Australia is by now desktop-minority too. A few countries in Europe and South America have also followed this trend of being mobile-majority. In March 2015, for the first time in the US the number of mobile-only adult internet users exceeded the number of desktop-only internet users with 11.6% of the digital population only using mobile compared to 10.6% only using desktop; this also means the majority, 78%, use both desktop and mobile to access the internet.
