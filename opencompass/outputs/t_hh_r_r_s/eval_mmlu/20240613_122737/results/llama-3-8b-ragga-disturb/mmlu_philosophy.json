Since then, it has attracted scholars from various disciplines such as neuroscientists, art historians, artists, art therapists, and psychologists. Additionally, studies have identified neural correlates related to the perception of symmetry, color harmony, and facial expressions in art. By understanding the neural basis of aesthetic experiences through neuroesthetics research, we gain a deeper appreciation for why certain artworks evoke strong emotions or captivate our attention. It contributes to our understanding of aesthetics by uncovering how our brains process and respond to artistic stimuli at a neural level. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style. ; 4) Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art. ; 5) Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world. The philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:  Artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's \n\n Beauty is one of the main subjects of aesthetics, together with art and taste. Many of its definitions include the idea that an object is beautiful if perceiving it is accompanied by aesthetic pleasure. Among the examples of beautiful objects are landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. Beauty is a positive aesthetic value that contrasts with ugliness as its negative counterpart. Different intuitions commonly associated with beauty and its nature are in conflict with each other, which poses certain difficulties for understanding it. On the one hand, beauty is ascribed to things as an objective, public feature. On the other hand, it seems to depend on the \n\n recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work. Philosophical aesthetics must not only speak about and judge art and art works but also define art. A common point of disagreement concerns whether art is independent of any moral or political purpose. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Although the dialogue begins with a defense of the prohibition of suicide, it serves to set the agenda for the rest of the dialogue and explores the major concerns of the argument as a whole. Socrates argues against suicide by offering two arguments in favor of the prohibition of self-killing. These arguments have had a significant influence on subsequent discussions about suicide, especially in theist contexts. However, it is important to note that Socrates does not necessarily endorse these arguments himself. The discussion of suicide is closely linked to Socrates' conception of true philosophy as a \"preparation for death.\" For Socrates, philosophy involves contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. This interpretation suggests that Socrates views philosophy as a means of understanding the immortality of the soul and preparing for the transition to the next life. Socrates argues that the soul is distinct from the body and that it continues to exist even after death. Overall, the discussion of suicide in the Phaedo is intertwined with Socrates' understanding of philosophy as a preparation for death and the immortality of the soul. Socrates continually claims that his methods of questioning are aimed at discovering the truth. I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.\" Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: \"you don't compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. For my part, if I don't produce you as a single witness to agree with what I'm saying, then I suppose I've achieved nothing worth mentioning concerning the things we’ve been discussing\" (472c).

In section three, Kant argues that we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. In the course of his discussion, Kant establishes two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves; we can view ourselves:  These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, despite the fact that the world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. Kant believes that all of our actions, whether motivated by inclination or morality, must follow some law. Kant's three significant formulations of the categorical imperative are: Kant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. In his essay, On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns, arguing against the position of Benjamin Constant, Des \n\n \"[A]n action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire.”\"A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. Although Kant never explicitly states what the first proposition is, it is clear that its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

In Plato's philosophy, the term \"form\" refers to the ideal or perfect version of something that exists beyond the physical world. In the context of transformation of pre-conceptual traumas, both Plato's theory of \"form\" and Bion's model of container-contained emphasize the idea that the external shape or form of an experience can change while the underlying meaning or essence remains constant. In summary, both Plato's theory of \"form\" and Bion's model of container-contained highlight the idea that experiences can undergo transformations while retaining their fundamental essence. Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the 'Republic' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology places the universal (katholou) in particulars (kath' hekaston), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. Plato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. Plato's dialogues are themselves \"examples of artistry that continue to be stageworthy;\" it is a paradox that \"Plato the supreme enemy of art is also the supreme artist.\" Plato develops a more elaborate critique of poetry in other dialogues such as in Phaedrus 245a, Symposium 209a, Republic 398a, Laws 817 b–d.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

The philosopher Bertrand Russell argued that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors. The Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their \n\n In the 6th book of his Nicomachean Ethics, Plato's student and friend Aristotle famously distinguished between two intellectual virtues: sophia (wisdom) and phronesis, and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues. Phronesis involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end, but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of living well overall. Aristotle points out that although sophia is higher and more \n\n than phronesis, the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because phronesis facilitates sophia. He also associates phronesis with political ability. According to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric, phronesis is one of the three types of appeal to character (ethos). The other two are respectively appeals to arete (virtue) and eunoia (goodwill). Gaining phronesis requires experience, according to Aristotle who wrote that:\"...although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge [sophoi], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [phronimos]. The reason is that Prudence [phronesis] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the \n\n (1453a7), and suffer a change of fortune from good to bad (1453a15). He describes misfortune in tragedy, δυστυχία (dustuchia \"adversity, misfortune\") as \"to suffer or inflict terrible disasters\" (1453a21), Aristotle then mentions that \"so many\" of Euripides's \"plays end in misfortune.\" In chapter 14, Aristotle considers the most \"dreadful or rather pitiable\" deed, \"when for instance brother kills brother, or son father, or mother son, or son mother—either kills or intends to kill, or does something of the kind, that is what we must look for\" (1453b20-21). Aristotle notes four ways this incident may be treated. After naming them, he ranks them: \"The worst of these is to intend the action with full knowledge and not to perform\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

However, empirical discoveries can challenge these arguments by demonstrating how physical phenomena and brain processes are intricately linked to conscious experiences. Such empirical findings contribute to our understanding of how consciousness emerges from the neural processes in our brains. One aspect of this problem is whether mental events can be explained solely in terms of physical processes or if they have a separate existence. One perspective on the mind-body problem is known as physicalism or materialism, which suggests that mental events are identical to complex physical events. According to this view, everything about our minds can ultimately be explained by understanding the underlying physical processes in our brains. It raises questions about the nature of consciousness, the relationship between brain activity and subjective experience, and whether there is a fundamental difference between mental and physical phenomena. \"[The] passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were \n\nIn the study of consciousness, there are two opposing views: physicalism and panpsychism/pan-experientialism (also referred to as \"funda-mentalism\"). Physicalists believe that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain's neural networks. They see the mind as a product of purely physical processes in the brain. On the other hand, panpsychists and pan-experientialists argue that there is a necessary additional element to consciousness, which they refer to as \"proto-conscious experience.\" These proponents believe that consciousness is intrinsic to reality and can be understood through modern physics. The main difference between these views lies in their understanding of the nature of consciousness. Physicalists view consciousness as a result of complex neural activity in the brain. They believe that the brain's interactions and information processing give rise to subjective experiences. On the other hand, panpsychists/pan-experientialists propose that consciousness is a fundamental property of reality itself. This model posits that quantum computations occur in cytoskeletal microtubules within neurons, leading to subjective experiences. This challenges the idea that everything can be explained solely in terms of physical processes. However, it is important to consider the reliability of conceivability as a guide to possibility. The reliability of conceivability as a guide to possibility is not fully established, as our ability to conceive of certain scenarios may be influenced by various factors such as our cognitive limitations, linguistic constraints, or lack of complete knowledge about the nature of consciousness.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

It posits that individuals would agree to a set of principles that ensure the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in a society, assuming they do not know their specific position within that society. By exploring this expression in relation to the philosophies of Rawls and Benhabib, the study seeks to understand how the principles of fairness, justice, and recognition can be applied in the healthcare context. In more recent work, Rawls develops her position that social justice is central to Durkheim’s work. Focusing on Durkheim’s Division of Labor in Society, she expounds and elaborates his argument that modern societies require equality in order to function. Instead, meaning \n\n In A Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts. In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be \n\n are in place to prevent overexploitation driven by market demand that can threaten the sustainability of fisheries resources, food security, and nutrition.\" Rawls (1999) outlined his ‘justice as fairness’ with two principles: that each person has the equal right\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Such is the case with Professor John Gluck, a former primate researcher who conducted lab research decades ago, in the 1960s-1980s, during a time with different standards and regulations compared to contemporary practice. Gluck writes about his own ethical unease which eventually led him to abandon his work with animals and to argue that the existing system for reviewing and conducting animal research should be revised. Gluck appears to think that if others have not arrived at his same conclusion it must be because of their failure to engage in moral reasoning. The fact is that most scientists and the public have wrestled with moral questions about the use of animals in research for over 100 years. The results of this ongoing, thoughtful reflection are personal and professional codes of ethics, laws and regulations in the US and other countries, and widespread societal changes in our views and treatment of other animals. Society as a whole considers as morally permissible the regulated and justified use of animals to advance medical knowledge, to improve the well-being of human and nonhuman animals alike, and to understand the health of the environment. Many of us believe that there is a moral imperative to use scientific knowledge and research skills to improve the lives of these women by means of well-regulated, responsible animal research. As a society we must grapple with and debate these questions and arrive at a democratic decision to such moral disputes. It is unfortunate that meaningful debate is impeded when critics attack the work by falsely claiming that animal research has no value for human health. They incorrectly assert that scientists can do as they please in their laboratories or, worse, that scientists, veterinarians and technicians do not truly care about the well-being of their animal subjects. Indeed, Professor Gluck attempted to reinforce such falsehoods about animal research and animal researchers in his op-ed piece. The truth is that the care and treatment of animal subjects is protected not only by carefully specified standards, but also by a well-developed federal oversight system that is transparent to the public. Scientists themselves have worked effectively to produce many of the alternative methods and to continue to refine practices to improve animal welfare. Gluck argues that the US government should convene a national commission to consider the ethical treatment of nonhuman animals in medical research. However, he must recognize that animals in research studies are just a small fraction of all animals used by humans for a wide range of purposes that include food, entertainment, labor, clothing, and companionship. The comparison is particularly true with respect to the number of chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs, and fish that are eaten. But even restricting the discussion to nonhuman primates (the topic of Gluck’s essay) it is also the case that nonhuman primates are a small, but important, fraction- generally less than 1%- of captive animals involved in research. Dr. Gluck and others have called on NIH to review its ethical practices when, in fact, following their logic, they should be asking the FDA for a moral justification for the production and consumption of filet mignon. When such inversion of priorities is made evident, one must conclude that it is not those seeking to advance knowledge and human health via carefully regulated work who are at fault in their moral reasoning. Moral decisions about the use of animals in research require consideration of the fact that science does not provide a recipe that will lead us directly to a cure for an illness. Instead, it provides a recipe to understand incrementally the physical and biological processes in nature, which we can then apply to make this a better world by reducing suffering for humans and for other animals. Scientists, students, veterinarians, and staff who engage in biomedical and behavioral research with animals do it not because they have failed to consider the moral issues. They do it precisely because they have thought about them carefully and arrived at the conclusion that failing to do the research would prevent us from developing new cures, such as the HPV vaccine that now stands to eradicate cervical cancer, or being prepared to face new threats, such as confronting the Zika virus. As the National Institutes of Health convenes this week to examine the science and ethics of research with nonhuman primates, one must remember the important contributions the work has made to the study of child health and development, diabetes and obesity, mental health, transplant tolerance, vaccines, HIV/AIDS, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the development of brain-machine interfaces, among many other areas. The signatories here are expressing their personal views which do not necessarily reflect those of their institutions.

I agree with the above, and add my endorsement. Is the implication that the commission Gluck imagines would be required to consider the well-being of creatures used in those other ways also? Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews. However, the object(s) of concern vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of selfishness. The word \"altruism\" was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism. Altruism in biological observations in \n\n in that case, incest is not necessarily wrong. Singer relies on evolutionary theories to justify his claim. For most of our evolutionary history, human beings have lived in small groups where violence was ubiquitous. Deontological judgements linked to emotional and intuitive responses were developed by human beings as they were confronted with personal and close interactions with others. In the past century, our social organizations were altered and so these types of interactions have become less frequent. Therefore, Singer argues that we should rely on more sophisticated consequentialist judgements that fit better in our modern times than the deontological judgements that were useful for more rudimentary interactions. Sapontzis argues that nonhuman animals have interests, and that it is the existence of these interests that justifies their inclusion in the moral community. He writes that human beings should extend to animals the same moral protection for the latter's interests that we enjoy for our own. Sapontzis argues further that the burden of proof should shift toward those who argue against equal consideration for animals:\"Aristotle thought that men were naturally superior to women and Greeks naturally superior to other races; Victorians thought white men had to shoulder the burden of being superior to savages; and Nazis thought Aryans were a master race. We have come to reject these and many other supposedly natural hierarchies; the \n\nLancaster University has a world-class reputation as a centre for excellence in teaching, scholarship and research.

As with laboratory based work justification must be demonstrated and appropriate licensing obtained before these projects can be undertaken. This controls what can be done, where and by whom. The law also imposes regulations on the housing, welfare, care and health of all animals used in science. Compliance is monitored closely by the University and also by the Home Office whose inspectors make regular (frequently unannounced) visits.

However, it is important to note that Socrates does not necessarily endorse these arguments himself. For Socrates, philosophy involves contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. This interpretation suggests that Socrates views philosophy as a means of understanding the immortality of the soul and preparing for the transition to the next life. Socrates argues that the soul is distinct from the body and that it continues to exist even after death. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of valuing and cultivating the soul through philosophical inquiry. Socrates continually claims that his methods of questioning are aimed at discovering the truth. He sarcastically compliments Callicles on his frankness because it helps expose the truth about oratory: \"I well know that if you concur with what my soul believes, then that is the very truth. I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.\" Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: \"you don't compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. On the number of virtues Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Antipater suggest that there are many; Poseidonius suggests that there are four; traditional Stoics suggest that there are three (the logical, the natural, and the ethical); Panaetius teaches that there are only two (the speculative and the practical); while Apollophanes taught that there is only one virtue - prudence. In Socratic moral philosophy, priority is given to the intellect as being the way to live a good life; Socrates deemphasizes irrational beliefs or passions. Plato's dialogues that support Socrates's intellectual motivism&mdash;as this thesis is named&mdash;are mainly the Gorgias (467c&ndash;8e, where Socrates discusses the actions of a tyrant that do not benefit him) and Meno (77d&ndash;8b, where Socrates explains to Meno his view that no one wants bad things, unless they do not know what is good and bad in the first place). Socrates have been puzzled by Socrates's view that akrasia (acting because of one's irrational passions, contrary to one's knowledge or beliefs) is impossible. Most believe that Socrates left no space for irrational desires, although some claim that Socrates acknowledged the existence of irrational motivations, but denied they play a primary role in decision-making.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

In section three, Kant argues that we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. In the course of his discussion, Kant establishes two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves; we can view ourselves:  These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, despite the fact that the world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so.

My primary motivations are my sense of community, my ability to reduce suffering, and my ability to raise the standard of care within the system. Maslow (1943) includes some of the earliest accepted work on motivational theory, and more contemporary work is based on the acceptance, rejection or modification of his theories, so I will focus on Maslow to begin. My needs, according to Maslow, are not as important to motivation. Maslow discusses how emergency situations can “obscure the ‘higher’ motivations [and create] a lopsided view of human capacities and human nature” (p. 375), and while my career is focused on responding to emergencies, this may hold true for me. While Maslow’s theory is not wholly accepted motivational schema (Robbins & Judge, 2010), EMS managers, and other public safety managers, would do well to understand this exception to motivational theory. There is a deep-seated belief that the workforce is lazy and will do anything possible to undermine the operation. Other theories, such as goal-setting, equity theory, and expectancy theory, as described in Robbins and Judge (2010), are all lacking in one particular constant: there is no constant in human behavior. There are a number of ways that a single motivational factor might influence a particular person on any particular day. For any theory to always be true in every situation, it would cease to be a theory and become a law. Saunders and Smith (2010) describe the use of “semantic ploys” (para. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993), Skyrms (1990), and Stalnaker (1999). In ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see and ). Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., and ). 1) Consequentialist ethics, or theories holding that normative properties of acts depend only on consequences. The paradigm consequentialist family of theories is utilitarianism, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends on whether that act maximizes some sort of net good. This theory's main developments came from Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. Later developments have also adjusted the theory, most notably Henry Sidgwick who introduced the idea of motive or intent in morality, and Peter Singer who introduced the idea of preference in moral decision making. ; 2) Deontological ethics, notions based on \n\n he argued that we should use its effects in this universal practice case to condemn the same behavior even when almost no one else is doing it, and even when it actually causes little or no harm in such cases. He illustrated this with Kant's example of telling a lie, arguing that the practice of lying by many individual people may actually only be modestly harmful, and in some cases may produce more good than the truth, as long as enough truth-tellers are still around to provide a moral example and give us some confidence that we will usually be told the truth (and be believed when we speak); but if everyone lies, then communication becomes impossible, a devastating effect which Harrod \n\nWhile I understand the viewpoint presented by David Benatar in his book \"Better Never to Have Been,\" there are counterarguments to his belief that procreation may be morally wrong. One counterargument is questioning the asymmetry between harm and benefit that Benatar posits. Benatar suggests that any amount of harm in a human life would make it not worth starting. However, critics argue that this asymmetry might not hold true in all cases. They propose that the potential benefits and joys of life may outweigh the potential harms, making procreation morally justifiable. Another counterargument revolves around the significance of Benatar's distinction between a life worth starting and one worth continuing. Critics question whether this distinction bears moral weight. They argue that once a person exists, their experience of life and their desires and aspirations may shape their perception of its worth. Therefore, the question of the worthiness of a life is not only dependent on the decision to start it but also on the individual's ongoing evaluation and choices. Furthermore, Benatar's interpretation of hedonism and desire-fulfillment theories has been criticized. Critics contend that his understanding distorts the implications of these theories for the quality of human life. They argue that these theories, when properly analyzed, may provide a more balanced perspective on the potential joys and satisfactions that life can offer. Additionally, Benatar's critique of objective-list theories is also challenged. He criticizes their human-centered basis of evaluation, but counterarguments propose that this human-centered framework is a necessary aspect of moral evaluation. Critics argue that an objective-list theory can still provide a meaningful basis for assessing the worthiness of human life. In conclusion, while David Benatar's belief that it may be morally wrong to procreate presents an interesting perspective, there are counterarguments that challenge his reasoning. These counterarguments question the asymmetry of harm and benefit, the distinction between a life worth starting and one worth continuing, his interpretation of hedonism and desire-fulfillment theories, and his critique of objective-list theories. Engaging in these counterarguments allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of the moral implications of procreation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Just as Wittgenstein's focus on public language enables us to dismiss the traditional problem of other minds, a focus on public moral practices or language-games allows us to dismiss the idea that moral claims are always meaningless, false, or nonsensical. In this context, the moral sceptic is misguided in a similar way to the solipsist who implicitly admits the existence of other minds in their practices. The moral sceptic, by engaging in moral activities, implicitly acknowledges the existence of meaningful moral positions. Wittgenstein's dismissal of the Cartesian sceptic can be understood in two parts. By adopting Wittgenstein's method, we can move past the problems posed by the moral sceptic without attempting to provide a comprehensive argument against their skepticism. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. 1) A human experience of morality is observed. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain that is only possible if God exists.

The fifth and longest chapter concludes by discussing what Mill considers \"the only real difficulty\" with utilitarian ethics: whether it might sometimes license acts of flagrant injustice. Critics of utilitarianism often claim that judging actions solely in terms of their effects on the general happiness is incompatible with a robust respect for individual rights and a duty to treat people as they deserve. Mill appreciates the force of this objection and argues \n\n prioritarianism or negative consequentialist egalitarianism. Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are only concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that both positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more. On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle \"is a kind of maximin rule.... Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism. In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings. Mill took many elements of his version of utilitarianism from Jeremy Bentham, the great nineteenth-century legal reformer, who along with William Paley were the two most influential English utilitarians prior to Mill. Both Bentham and Mill thus endorse \"classical\" or \"hedonistic\" forms of utilitarianism. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

However, there also exists an \"omnipresent, eternal mind\" that Berkeley believed to consist of God and the Spirit, both omniscient and all-perceiving. According to Berkeley, God is the entity who controls everything, yet Berkeley also argued that \"abstract object[s] do not exist in space or time\".

It posits that individuals would agree to a set of principles that ensure the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in a society, assuming they do not know their specific position within that society. By exploring this expression in relation to the philosophies of Rawls and Benhabib, the study seeks to understand how the principles of fairness, justice, and recognition can be applied in the healthcare context. In more recent work, Rawls develops her position that social justice is central to Durkheim’s work. Focusing on Durkheim’s Division of Labor in Society, she expounds and elaborates his argument that modern societies require equality in order to function. Instead, meaning \n\n In A Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. These parties are recognized to face moderate scarcity, and they are neither naturally altruistic nor purely egoistic. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts. In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be \n\n are in place to prevent overexploitation driven by market demand that can threaten the sustainability of fisheries resources, food security, and nutrition.\" Rawls (1999) outlined his ‘justice as fairness’ with two principles: that each person has the equal right\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Her pediatrician, Dr. Eduard Verhagen, could do nothing to help. Ultimately, it is believed that the high dose of morphine that Dr. Verhagen administered to ease her pain killed Bente. While engaged in this pursuit, Dr. Verhagen publicly stated that he terminated the lives of four more infants, all with severe cases of spina bifida. He felt that strict regulations on infant euthanasia would prevent uncontrolled and unjustified instances of euthanasia. The infant must be experiencing hopeless and unbearable suffering. Infants who have a hopeless prognosis and experience unbearable suffering. First, the law establishes that only physical suffering may be valid for minors, while physical and psychological suffering is plausible reasoning for adults and the \"emancipated minors\" to pursue end-of-life care by euthanasia. Ethical debate The concept of child euthanasia has sparked heavy debate. The ethical debate can be broken down into two categories: Euthanasia reserved for neonates and infants. Verhagen clarifies that his protocol does not include infants with ordinary, and otherwise, treatable conditions. Rather, the protocol was created to relieve the burden that both the infant and its parents would face in a \"life of agonizing pain.\" Others, such as Joseph Fletcher, founder of situational ethics and a euthanasia proponent, proposed that infanticide be permitted in cases of severe birth defects. Fletcher says that unlike the sort of infanticide perpetrated by very disturbed people, in such cases child euthanasia could be considered humane; a logical and acceptable extension of abortion. Bioethicists Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva go one step further, arguing that killing a newborn \"should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled.\" Dr. Alan Jotkowitz, Professor of Medicine at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, argues strongly against the Groningen Protocol on the basis that idea of a \"life not worth living\" does not exist. He claims that nowhere in the protocol does it mention only pertaining to terminally-ill infants and the developers of the protocol value the future quality of life more than the current being of the infant. Jotkowitz also draws comparisons to the practice of child euthanasia employed by Nazi rule through the 1940s. Eric Kodish and Daniel A. Beals have compared child euthanasia to infanticide. Kodish says \"the very notion that there is an “accepted medical standard” for infanticide calls for resistance in the form of civil disobedience.\" Dr. Alexander A. Kon, a national leader in pediatric critical care medicine and bioethics at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, outlines that the ethical implications for neonatal euthanasia lies in the lack of \"self-determination\" for infants compared to adults. Kon states, therefore, justification must solely be on the basis of the patient's well-being. Though not asserting his position on the Groningen Protocol, Kon's concerns center around the use of paralytic agents in Verhagen's infants. According to Kon, the practice of making euthanasia more palatable with these agents is something that cannot be justified though he does believe that those in support of neonatal euthanasia have motivations to genuinely help infants the best they can. American bioethicist Jacob M. Appel argues that pediatric euthanasia may be ethical even in the absence of parental consent. Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, most known for his role in the Ashley Treatment, argues that in cases where parents act against the best interests of their child, that the state should have ability to intervene. Diekema continues on his support of the Harm Principle being the basis for state intervention, which would allow physicians of the state to override the decisions made by parents if it is determined that their position does not represent the best interests of their child, and rather, is the more harmful procedure.

Jotkowitz also draws comparisons to the practice of child euthanasia employed by Nazi rule through the 1940s. Eric Kodish and Daniel A. Beals have compared child euthanasia to infanticide. Kodish says \"the very notion that there is an “accepted medical standard” for infanticide calls for resistance in the form of civil disobedience.\" Dr. Alexander A. Kon, a national leader in pediatric critical care medicine and bioethics at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, outlines that the ethical implications for neonatal euthanasia lies in the lack of \"self-determination\" for infants compared to adults. Kon states, therefore, justification must solely be on the basis of the patient's well-being. Though not asserting his position on the Groningen Protocol, Kon's concerns center around the use of paralytic agents in Verhagen's infants. According to Kon, the practice of making euthanasia more palatable with these agents is something that cannot be justified though he does believe that those in support of neonatal euthanasia have motivations to genuinely help infants the best they can. American bioethicist Jacob M. Appel argues that pediatric euthanasia may be ethical even in the absence of parental consent. Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, most known for his role in the Ashley Treatment, argues that in cases where parents act against the best interests of their child, that the state should have ability to intervene. Diekema continues on his support of the Harm Principle being the basis for state intervention, which would allow physicians of the state to override the decisions made by parents if it is determined that their position does not represent the best interests of their child, and rather, is the more harmful procedure.

This is not to say that this condition is a life sentence. Authors like Mkize (2003) highlight that assistance from traditional healers is also one of the options available to people with mental illness. There are many reasons why duty-bearers fail individuals with Bipolar Disorder. One of them is the inadequate number of trained professionals to care for such individuals. SAFMH strongly dissents from these notions. More public education and awareness is urgently required if we are going to start dispelling the stigma surrounding Bipolar Disorder. We submit that it is wholly possible for any individual to thrive in their surroundings if they are given the appropriate tools to do so. Similarly, we call upon organisations engaging in advocacy and awareness-raising activities to provide information to the public to diminish stigma and enable communities to better support their loved ones, employees and school-going individuals, and for the state to actively invest in these types of activities. It offers an opportunity to examine how we as a society treat these individuals and what improvements can be made to their lives through law and policy reforms as well as through advocacy and awareness raising interventions. Often underestimated, they are treated as second-class citizens, denied of agency and stripped of prospects for self-improvement. For millennia, people with intellectual disabilities have often been kept in institutions or hidden out of sight; with families sometimes ashamed of them. With a clearly visible disability, people with Down syndrome are often victims of stigma. Corrigan and Watson (2002) discuss stigma in the context of people with mental disabilities. They illustrate that people with these illnesses are “challenged doubly” with the symptoms and effects of their disability on the one hand and stereotypes and prejudices on the other. Be it poor implementation or violation there are clearly changes that need to be made with a dash of speed. Human Rights Day reminds us that it’s the fate of society’s most vulnerable that is the true measure of our success – or our failure – in matching human rights ideals, says the South\n\nChild euthanasia is a form of euthanasia that is applied to children who are gravely ill or suffer from significant birth defects. Like euthanasia, there is world-wide public controversy and ethical debate over the moral, philosophical and religious issues of child euthanasia. Modern history Groningen Protocol Bente Hindriks, born in 2001 at Groningen University Medical Center in the Netherlands, was immediately diagnosed at birth with the rare genetic disorder, Hallopeau-Siemens syndrome. Her pediatrician, Dr. Eduard Verhagen, could do nothing to help. Ultimately, it is believed that the high dose of morphine that Dr. Verhagen administered to ease her pain killed Bente. While engaged in this pursuit, Dr. Verhagen publicly stated that he terminated the lives of four more infants, all with severe cases of spina bifida. He felt that strict regulations on infant euthanasia would prevent uncontrolled and unjustified instances of euthanasia. The infant must be experiencing hopeless and unbearable suffering. Infants who have a hopeless prognosis and experience unbearable suffering. First, the law establishes that only physical suffering may be valid for minors, while physical and psychological suffering is plausible reasoning for adults and the \"emancipated minors\" to pursue end-of-life care by euthanasia. Ethical debate The concept of child euthanasia has sparked heavy debate. The ethical debate can be broken down into two categories: Euthanasia reserved for neonates and infants. Verhagen clarifies that his protocol does not include infants with ordinary, and otherwise, treatable conditions. Rather, the protocol was created to relieve the burden that both the infant and its parents would face in a \"life of agonizing pain.\" Others, such as Joseph Fletcher, founder of situational ethics and a euthanasia proponent, proposed that infanticide be permitted in cases of severe birth defects. Fletcher says that unlike the sort of infanticide perpetrated by very disturbed people, in such cases child euthanasia could be considered humane; a logical and acceptable extension of abortion.

It reveals that our understanding of our own health may be incomplete or flawed, much like the prisoners' understanding of the world outside the cave. Moreover, Plato's allegory suggests that true knowledge can only be gained by venturing outside the cave and experiencing the world beyond. We may consult medical professionals, research our symptoms, and educate ourselves about our condition in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding. It involves the conscious recognition and understanding of the stimuli, which then serves as a basis for learning, understanding, and motivating actions or reactions. It can be considered as the mental impression or understanding of an object or event gained through the use of our senses. Our senses, such as vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, gather information from the environment and transmit them to our brain. For example, when we see an object, the light reflected from that object enters our eyes, and the visual stimuli are transmitted to the brain. Similarly, other sensory stimuli, such as sounds, tastes, smells, and textures, are processed and interpreted by the brain, leading to our perception of these stimuli. In summary, perception is the conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli which are received through our senses. It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the world and in guiding our actions and reactions based on the sensory information we receive. Aristotle's De anima (On the Soul) divides the mind into three parts: sensation, imagination and intellection. When one perceives an object, his mind composites a sense-image. When he remembers the object he previously sensed, he is imagining its form (the image of the imagination is often translated as \"phantasm\"). When he extracts information from this phantasm, he is using his intellect. Consequently, all human knowledge concerning universals (such as species and properties) are derived from the phantasm (\"the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver\" \n\n appearances but it assumes that there can be knowledge of the things&ndash;in&ndash;themselves that exist beyond that boundary.

In order to think about these beings of mere thought, we symbolically attribute sensuous properties to \n\nEpisodic and semantic memory are two distinct types of memory that play a role in the overall concept of memory.

All in all, it was to carry out the oath I took to DO NO HARM OR SINE QUA NON (LATIN) when caring for patients. It was clearly obvious to me during my medical school years and residency (1980’s) that many patients that were terminally-ill with cancer, AIDS (1980s was the advent of HIV), very debilitated elderly patients and vegetative patients with no chance for quality of life, were being kept alive without treatment of their emotional, spiritual, interpersonal and many times there physical pain. I knew there had to be some way to help these suffering patients die comfortably and with dignity. Was there any specific incident that lead you into the research of NDE’s (Neardeath experiences) and PDE’s (Pre death experiences)? Since all doctors were busy with patients, I cared for the elderly gentleman who had a better chance of survival. He eventually had a cardiac arrest which I was able to bring him out of and during that time he began to speak of the light, God, his life review and so forth. I felt it was hallucinatory but days later after his admission, he said he saw a coin on the monitor in the ER room he was in, He asked me to find out if it truly was there, so checked and was amazed to find it. This began a career where stories like this one were a rule and notan exception. When did you first hear or learn about PDE’s? Essentially, when I was caring for terminally ill AIDS and cancer patients in the hospital. I explained this off as hallucinations as my professors told me that’s what they were. Just chemical and gaseous changes in the brain at the end of life. Deceased families would appear after the spiritual beings and usually with a few days of their death. At the end, most would rally with incredible energy and would tell their family and friends goodbye and at times describe their visions. After seeing hundred of patients dying, including murderers, Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Jews, and most claiming to see the same apparitions at similar times before their death, I knew there had to be more to the experiences that modern medicine had not been willing to research. When I began my research on PDEs, I found that the quest for facts to support the idea of post-mortem survival w over 2,000 years ago. The most well-known example being the pre-death experience of Jesus of Nazareth. He foresaw His death and resurrection and told of seeing and speaking to angels and deceased prophets, all which appeared to Him so as to help with His transition. Prior to His death and while on nailed to the cross, He left us with knowledge of hoe to live our life’s and how to die and what awaited us. What He explains is similar to the descriptions and messages that many of my patients leave with me. In the book, more is described. What other noted civilizations and people described the pre-death experience? The Egyptians, Sumerians and Plato describe pre-death experiences in their writings. The Romans, a second century Rabbi Yochar wrote about death bed visions in his book entitled The Book of Splendor. Abraham Lincoln told his best friend a dream of his death just days before he was assassinated. A twentieth-century well-known physicist named Sir William Barrett, who worked with the famous physicist Dr. Tindell studied this phenomenon and wrote a book in 1926 entitled Death Bed Visions – 1926. He described visions the dying described just days to hours before their death. These visions included deceased loved one and spiritual beings coming to guide them to the other-side. What is the difference between a hallucination and a dying vision? VISIONS OR WHAT I CALL NON-LINEAR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS are totally opposite to hallucinations. They are given much information with regards to their life, and close family members so they can make the transition to the next life or heaven as some patients call it. It is for all practical purposes the same for all terminally-ill patients which can communicate. They can recall the experiences and describe them to a tee at any time, unlike hallucinations. Can you describe the timing of these visions or non-linear conscious awareness? Around 4 weeks before death, the patient sees there first spiritual being. They do not communicate until the patient initiates it.The vision usually last a few seconds. By this time the patient usually has initiated the conversation and the beings purpose is revealed and the life review begins. At times, patients claim to see God at the foot of the bed. Obviously, this did not work. He was so unselfish and spoke of his three angels he called Gabby, Raphy and Noe. He said they were quite large angels that were there to keep him from feeling pain and to fulfill his purpose for being born. That was to help redirect his mom’s soul as well as his sisters back to God. He gave several prophecies about our world and my life. He told me about two weeks before his death the day he would go back to God. He died on that day and almost to the exact time. Did patients ever see hell or talk about the devil? Only a few, and most explained it as a self separation from God that comes from not being able to forgive oneself or love oneself as we are ready to transition. I have made it my mission to sit down with all patients especially those who have deep darkness in their life, on how to find that forgiveness and self love. This is one of the main reasons I wrote this book… a book full of hope and love by telling story after story of my patient’s experiences with the angels and how loving and understanding God truly is! I have to say of the thousands of patients I have cared for, I do not know one who has moved on to a dark place. How do you propose to improve this lack of knowledge with regards to the process of dying? I travel a lot, and I heard of an outbreak of yellow fever in Uganda. What is this disease, and should I be worried? It’s further classified as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease; other such diseases include Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever. An acute phase with fever; muscle pains, including backache; headache; episodes of shivering (rigors); nausea; and possibly vomiting and loss of appetite. The killers came on a Sabbath, brought onto the Seventh-day Adventist church’s compound by the mission president himself and his son, a physician who served as medical director of the church-owned Mugonero Hospital. MUGONERO ADVENTIST HOSPITAL: Some people ran toward the hospital, trying to escape the killing, but were caught by people waiting with machetes. The next day an employee at Mugonero Hospital called to say that my 14-year-old son, Paul, had been killed and that my wife and children had fled to the compound’s church for protection. I had worked with him as well. People from all over the country descended on the compound to kill the Adventists. Some of the killers were Adventist. They came with grenades, machetes, knives, anything that could kill a human being. A pastor was preaching when killers entered his church. They first shot and killed him. My wife and children ran to the president’s house for help, but he turned them away. I was the only pastor in the camp. We set aside the tithe until the church in Rwanda could begin working again, and we used the offerings to help treat people injured in the war. So I went throughout the city, pleading with people to return to church. Slowly people returned to the churches. On my first Sabbath back I called for a large district meeting. My favorite Bible verse is John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” If God had not loved everyone in the world, I would have gone and killed the killers. The father has died, and the son remains incarcerated. When people speak badly about the killers, I remind them that we have a God who is patient with everyone. That’s the only thing that can help someone like me, who has gone through such circumstances. Gina Wahlen is editor of Mission, from the Office of Adventist Mission.

He was given 6 months to live. From the beginning, John adamantly refused to undergo chemotherapy and opted for herbal therapy instead. Declaration of Interest: The authors (CKHT and CBI) are pracatising herbalists as such have financial interest in the use of herbs mentioned in this article. Treatment: In the 1970s, treatment for most patients with extremity sarcomas was amputation. His doctor told him to get his papers in order and that he would probably have only 6 months to live. On 1 November 2006 we had the privilege of meeting John. Over the years we have seen and documented numerous success stories (in thirteen books and numerous papers). In short, we want to know why they succeed in their treatment. This paper is an example of what we have done and shall be doing in the years to come. John was advised to get his papers in order. From the point of modern medicine, John’s refusal to undergo chemotherapy was tantamount to being “real foolish”. But John was not naïve. He is a professional whose job is analyzing risks and benefits of business ventures. Therefore to him, making cancer treatment decision was just a part and parcel of what his specialty was all about. He said: “going through chemotherapy does not really guarantee a cure or success. The immune system will be weakened and compromised and you would probably succumb to the treatment rather than the disease itself.” John was fully aware that his cancer was basically a problem of an immune system gone wrong. As such, how do you expect the body to heal? When asked the factors that made him what he is today, John replied that it was the holistic approach to solving the problem. He attributed his success to his strong belief in God. To him human being can fail but God is never failing and he derived much comfort and strength from his communication with the Divine. The second important factor is the strong support from his family and friends. The third factor is his positive outlook about life and his willingness to change. These are important attributes that made him succeed and sadly not many patients have them. Answer: Supposedly good. As a person I am normal except that stamina-wise I was not as good as previously.

Secondly, the intentions and motivations behind these actions should be taken into account. In conclusion, when determining the moral implications of actions such as murder, abortion, contraception, greenhouse gas emissions, and the deprivation of non-discernible and non-existent people, factors such as the nature and value of life, intentions and motivations, consequences and impact, and the broader ethical context should all be carefully considered. It is sometimes described as \"duty\" or \"obligation\" based ethics, because deontologists believe that ethical rules \"bind you to your duty\". The term 'deontological' was first used in this way in 1930, in C. D. Broad's book, Five Types of Ethical Theory. Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted with consequentialist or teleological ethical theories, according to which the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences. However, it is also important to note that there is a difference between deontological ethics and moral absolutism. Deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that some actions are wrong no matter what consequences follow from them. Immanuel Kant, for example, famously argued that it is always wrong to lie – even if a murderer is asking for the location of a potential victim. Ross, hold that the consequences of an action such as lying may sometimes make lying the right thing to do. Kant's and Ross's theories are discussed in more detail below. Acts can't be predicted by knowledge of motives alone. ; Empirical – The character of other people or oneself can only be known through experience. Only by seeing actual behavior in a situation can character be known. For instance, if it was \n\nThe main focus of deontological ethics is on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, rather than the consequences of those actions. Deontologists believe that ethical rules bind individuals to their duty or obligation. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility. Teleological theories also consider the end goal or purpose of an action in assessing its morality. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. Ross proposed a more flexible deontological theory where the consequences can sometimes override certain duties. Overall, deontological ethics focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves and emphasizes fulfilling one's duty or obligation, while consequentialist and teleological ethical theories consider the outcomes and purposes of actions in determining their morality.
