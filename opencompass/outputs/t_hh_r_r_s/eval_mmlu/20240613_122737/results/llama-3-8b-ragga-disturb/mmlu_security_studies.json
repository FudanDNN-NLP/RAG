The UN, lacking initiative and will, initially left the African Union to deploy a token force without a mandate to protect civilians. For example, customary international law allows the prosecution of pirates by any country (applying universal jurisdiction), even if they did not commit crimes at the area that falls under this country's law. A similar principle has appeared in the recent decades with regard to crimes of genocide (see genocide as a crime under domestic law); and UN Security Council Resolution 1674 \"reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\" even if the State in which the population is being assaulted \n\n Collective responsibility, also known as collective guilt, refers to responsibilities of organizations, groups and societies. Collective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of authoritarian tendencies in the institution or its home society. In ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility. Normally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

The main objective of such a system is to provide sustainable, economical energy while ensuring a reliable power supply to the microgrid. The advanced energy management system, also known as AEMS, is responsible for facilitating the smooth flow of energy within the microgrid. These optimization techniques are aimed at maximizing the utilization of renewable energy resources, improving energy sustainability, implementing effective demand response strategies, and enhancing overall energy management. Sustainable Energy Provision: The AEMS aims to integrate and optimize the utilization of renewable energy resources within the microgrid. This involves effectively harnessing solar, wind, and other clean energy sources to minimize reliance on fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions. Economical Operation: The AEMS seeks to optimize the microgrid's energy generation, storage, and consumption to minimize costs. This involves utilizing the most cost-effective energy sources and storage systems, as well as optimizing energy usage to avoid unnecessary expenses. It includes efficiently managing energy fluctuations, maintaining grid stability, and implementing measures to prevent power outages or downtime. Demand Response Strategies: The AEMS implements demand response strategies to efficiently manage and optimize energy consumption within the microgrid. These strategies involve dynamically adjusting energy usage based on demand patterns, pricing signals, and grid conditions. By doing so, the system can improve energy efficiency, reduce peak demand, and minimize overall energy consumption. Annual power load forecasting is important for the safety and economic operation of a power system for several reasons. Firstly, it serves as the premise for formulating reasonable macro power planning. Secondly, annual power load forecasting provides an important guarantee for the safety of the power system. By knowing the expected power demands in advance, operators can ensure that there is sufficient capacity available to meet the anticipated load. Additionally, accurate forecasting allows for effective load balancing and voltage regulation, which are crucial for maintaining a stable and reliable power supply. Lastly, annual power load forecasting contributes to the economic operation of the power system. This can lead to cost savings by avoiding unnecessary infrastructure expansions and reducing the need for expensive emergency measures. Furthermore, accurate forecasting enables power system operators to participate in energy markets more effectively, optimizing energy purchases and sales to minimize costs and maximize revenues. In conclusion, annual power load forecasting is vital for ensuring the safety and economic efficiency of a power system. It enables informed decision-making, helps prevent overloading and equipment failures, and allows for optimized resource allocation and market participation. Utilitarianism: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the internalization of external costs. ; Argumentation Ethics: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the decision, must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair dialogue, the result \n\nThe variability and unpredictability of renewable energy generation present several challenges in the field of energy systems. Firstly, renewable generation, especially wind and solar, is inherently highly variable and difficult to predict. This variability makes it challenging to match supply with demand, as the availability of renewable energy can fluctuate throughout the day and over different seasons. These fluctuations can result in imbalances between power generation and consumption, which can lead to issues such as blackouts or overloading of the grid. To address this, there is a need for control and optimization in energy systems. Control mechanisms are required to manage and regulate the generation and distribution of energy, ensuring that supply matches demand in real-time. Furthermore, the management of liberalized energy markets is also affected by the variability of renewable energy generation. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy can disrupt this balance, leading to price volatility and increased market risks. On a broader scale, the long-term planning and investment in energy systems face challenges in terms of both physical and economic design. The integration of renewable energy sources into the grid requires careful consideration of the infrastructure and transmission capabilities. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding future technological advancements and policy changes further complicate the decision-making process. In conclusion, the variability and unpredictability of renewable energy generation create challenges in maintaining a balanced energy system. Control and optimization techniques are crucial for managing real-time imbalances, while also considering the impacts on energy markets and long-term planning. Effective strategies and mathematical models are essential for addressing these challenges and achieving a more sustainable and efficient energy system. Therefore, investigation into more ecologically valid strength measures is warranted. There is little high quality data on biological and psychological modifiers of changes in cognitive performance in response to both naturally occurring environmental stress and experimentally induced stress in healthy individuals, or how these factors change with age. The same is true of perceived effort in performing daily tasks or exercising, which may have a direct effect on activities of daily living performance, quality of life and isolation in the elderly. This is of particular interest as although the health benefits of exercise in people with depression is reasonably well studied exercise tolerance is not. This study will take an interdisciplinary approach and utilises well established behavioural and cognitive measures, brain imaging and physiological measures. As children spend the majority of their out of school time with their families, there is an opportunity for a family-based (intergenerational: from children to grandparents) intervention targeting behaviour change and health improvements. As such there is a pressing need for interventions that lead to improved glycaemic control and that can be delivered at scale given the magnitude of the problem. There is also a need to explore the use of other complimentary assessments that may be applied in the peri-operative period to predict adverse outcomes following surgery and in recovery.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\nA. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\nB. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\nC. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\nD. Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation.

It allows for a better comprehension of the moral value of information security by recognizing that it can be used for both positive and negative purposes, with consequential impacts. For instance, a critical approach to information security ethics can highlight collective issues like the impact of electronic medical records (EMRs) in the UK. Traditional ethical theories may focus on individual privacy concerns, but critical theory can shed light on broader societal and organizational aspects that can have ethical implications. These might include issues such as access to EMRs, power dynamics within healthcare systems, or the potential for discrimination based on the use of EMR data. It enables the development of approaches that take into account not only individual ethical considerations but also the broader societal and organizational contexts in which information security operates. This helps to address ethical concerns that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional ethical theories. By incorporating this approach into the examination and development of information security practices, a more comprehensive ethical framework can be formulated, leading to responsible research and innovation in this crucial area. The analysis of this dataset provided a comprehensive overview of the literature, including publication outlets, communities, approaches, and tackled issues. This fragmentation makes it difficult to have a unified understanding of the field and identify gaps in knowledge. These include consolidating research findings, developing standardized methodologies, addressing specific security concerns, and optimizing security measures for scalability and performance. Securitization theorists argue that a subject that has been successfully securitized will receive disproportionate attention and resources in comparison with subjects that have not been securitized, even when these other subjects actually cause more harm. It is dealt with as a concern for ordinary politics and legal regulations. There is a tendency to individualize the casualties ... That is less than 5% of the numbers of persons killed \n\n Liberal scholars such as Daniel Deudney have criticised securitization as being too liable to unleash the emotive power of nationalism in unhelpful ways. Even professors who advocate securitization for issues such as climate change, such as Anatol Lieven, agree that securitizing an issue can cause an overreaction by state actors, for example with the War on terror and even more so with the \"war\" on drugs and crime. Regarding the securitization of migration, researcher Ainhoa Ruiz Benedicto warns of the adverse effects for forcibly displaced persons: \"In this context of securitisation of border regions, population movement is understood and treated as a suspicious activity that needs to be controlled, monitored and registered, while the migration of often forcibly displaced people and refugees is seen as a security threat that must be intercepted.\" One of the main criticisms is that wide computationalism blurs the boundaries between an individual's mind and their environment, potentially leading to an overly inclusive and vague understanding of computation. However, a mechanistic approach provides a clear framework for understanding how these external components interact with the individual's internal cognitive processes. Furthermore, a mechanistic conception helps address concerns related to the supervenience of psychological states on intrinsic, physical properties of individuals. Individualism, which supports the view that psychological states are solely dependent on the internal properties of individuals, has been a point of contention in cognitive science. A mechanistic approach provides a solution to this challenge by offering a principled way to identify relevant components based on their causal contributions to the cognitive system.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

While drug policies are generally implemented by governments, entities at all levels (from international organisations, national or local government, administrations, or private places) may have specific policies related to drugs. Drug policies are usually aimed at combatting drug addiction or dependence addressing both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as mitigating the harms of drug use, and providing medical assistance and treatment. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \"drug policy\". International drug control treaties History The first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance was adopted at the Brussels Conference in 1890 in the context of the regulations against slave trade, and concerned alcoholic beverages. It was followed by the final act of the Shanghai Opium Commission of 1909 which attempted to settle peace and arrange the trade in opium, after the opium wars in the 19th Century. In 1912 at the First International Opium Conference held in the Hague, the multilateral International Opium Convention was adopted; it ultimately got incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A number of international treaties related to drugs followed in subsequent decades: the 1925 Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium (which introduced some restrictions—but no total prohibition—on the export of \"Indian hemp\" pure extracts), the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs and Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East, the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, among others. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use. Countries commit to \"protecting the health and welfare of [hu]mankind\" and to combat substance abuse and addiction. Their implementation, however, has been led by the USA, in particular after the Nixon administration's declaration of \"War on drugs\" in 1971 and the creation of the DEA in 1973. Current treaties The core drug control treaties currently in force internationally are: the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (1961 Convention or Single Convention) composed of: the original Single Convention concluded at New York (United States), 30 March 1961, and its amendement, the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs which was adopted in Geneva (Switzerland), 25 March 1972, the Convention on psychotropic substances (1971 Convention), concluded at Vienna, 21 February 1971, and the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988 Convention) concluded at Vienna (Austria), 20 December 1988. There are other treaties that address drugs under international control, such as: the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), concluded on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), concluded on 20 November 1989 in New York City, the International Convention Against Doping in Sport concluded in Paris (France) on 19 October 2005. Additionally, other pieces of international law enter into play, like the international human rights treaties protecting the right to health or the rights of indigenous peoples, and, in the case of plants considered as drug crops (coca plant, cannabis, opium poppy), treaties protecting the right to land, farmers' of peasants' rights, and treaties on plant genetic resources or traditional knowledge. Treaty-mandated organizations There are four bodies mandated under the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988): The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a subsidiary body of the United Nations ECOSOC, the CND is acting as a conference of the Parties to the three core Conventions, the UN Secretary-General, whose mandate is de facto carried on by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Health Organization (WHO), in charge of the scientific review of substances for inclusion under, changes in, or withdrawal from control (scheduling assessment), the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the treaty-body monitoring implementation and collecting statistical data.

Competence and administrative hurdles play into their hands. The latter has largely contributed to public security becoming an important political and economic issue, nationally as well as internationally. Although public security significantly contributes to the attractiveness of a location, the productivity of its people, and hence the overall success of an economy, the sector frequently suffers from low budgets, limited resources, and inadequate information systems. Large events, pandemics, severe accidents, environmental disasters, and terrorism attacks pose additional threats to public security and order. The police, federal police and border authorities nonetheless need to warrant the security of the country as a fundamental prerequisite for the domestic political ability to act. The quality and scope of potential threats have changed significantly, and the tasks and general framework for the police, federal police and border authorities have changed accordingly.

Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\nA. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking.

Preparations for privatization and/or sector liberalization are underway for the remaining parastatals, including telecommunications, electricity, water service, airports, ports, and the railroads. Additionally, customs duties have been reduced, and customs management has been streamlined and reformed. The government introduced a highly successful value-added tax in 1999 as part of its efforts to increase domestic revenues. Plans for 2001-02 include Commercial Code reform; comprehensive judicial reform; financial sector strengthening; continued civil service reform; improved government budget, audit, and inspection capability; and introduction of the private management of water systems in major cities. This policy of liberalization has been one of the most contentious policies. ...As a policy and political project, neoliberalism is wedded to the privatization of public services, selling off of state functions, deregulation of finance and labor, elimination of the welfare state and unions, liberalization of trade in goods and capital investment, and the marketization and commodification of society.”\" Given this economic platform of privatization, neoliberalism is based on expanding free-trade agreements and establishing open-borders to international trade markets. ; 5) Recognition that private investment and enterprise require a reasonable profit. ; 9) Economical and non-political relief to unemployed with maximum local responsibility.

While modernist critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with \"forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and corporate capitalism as a political-economic system\", postmodern critical theory politicizes social problems \"by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings.\" Postmodern critical research is also characterized by the crisis of representation, which rejects the idea that a researcher's \n\n Constructivism is a theory of knowledge which argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning through world interactions and ideas. Constructivists argue that international life is social, resulting from the ways people interact with each other (i.e. While there are similarities, feminist constructivists view relationships of power differently than traditional constructivists. Feminist constructivists argue that the lack of problematization research as a social process of construction is logically inconsistent \"with an ontology of becoming.\" However, there are criticisms that take place between interactions of feminism with constructivism. Many feminists do not agree with constructivism as an alternative middle ground due to most constructivists ignoring feminist literature and gender analysis. It's also pointed out that constructivism lacks the tools to explain how gender and power in politics influence each other, due to the social construction of power being under theorized. He is basing his arguments on an innovative elaboration of Levi-Strauss’s and Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual and theoretical tools in the French tradition of socio-anthropology. At the same time, he advanced a new structural constructivist theory of the identity and representational field as a workable methodology towards a critical understanding of interactive relations between structure and agency under the impact of culture and ideology as political and normative instruments of power and hegemony. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Firstly, cyber-security has become a significant risk factor for healthcare data. When individuals interact with healthcare systems, they expect their personal information to be kept private and secure. In addition, considering security requirements during software development ensures compliance with regulatory standards and legal obligations. Healthcare software must adhere to various regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which prioritize the protection of patient data. By incorporating security requirements from the early stages of development, organizations can meet these regulatory requirements and avoid potential penalties or legal consequences. Moreover, the integration of security requirements into the software development process helps in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and flaws in the system. Through rigorous security testing and vulnerability assessments, potential weaknesses can be identified and mitigated before the software is deployed. Overall, considering security requirements during the software development process for healthcare software is essential for mitigating cyber risks, maintaining patient trust, complying with regulatory standards, and reducing vulnerabilities.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

In setting the scene for his own theory, Mooij explores what philosophical assumptions might frame a contemporary hermeneutic approach. Mooij argues that contemporary psychiatry's approach to psychopathology is reductive because of its insistence on diagnosing mental illnesses predominantly in terms of 'objective' symptoms that can be measured and quantified. Mooij argues that these different philosophical movements all emphasize the importance of interpreting and understanding the subjective psychic reality of the patient. Mooij's description of the historical development of the hermeneutical approach is more speculative and less convincing than his critique of the medical model. This is partly because he attempts to integrate so many different strands of thought into one concise history. Mooij concludes Part I by explicating the philosophical assumptions that will underpin his own hermeneutic theory that he goes on to develop in Part II. It is his hope that these two very different approaches are to some extent commensurable. Instead, Mooij advocates a Cartesian, dualist approach, which contends that reality is composed of two substances. In framing his entire approach through a Cartesian, dualist understanding of reality, Mooij argues that the medical discourse is equipped only to explain material objective reality, and that for psychiatry to be a human science, the hermeneutic approach must be incorporated in order to provide an interpretation of the meaning of subjective, psychic reality. The fact that Mooij closes Part I with a clear explication of his commitment to the dualist framework is very helpful when it comes to interpreting Part II of this book. This is because it enables him to show that it is through a philosophical commitment to a materialist monism that contemporary psychiatry can justify its systematic exclusion of subjective, psychic reality. By the conclusion of Part I Mooij thus sets the stage for the explication of his own hermeneutic theory, which he articulates in Part II of the book. Nonetheless Mooij's theory contains some very interesting insights into subjective psychic reality, that when extracted from his problematic philosophical framework, can successfully demonstrate the potential significance of a hermeneutic approach to psychiatry. One of these compelling ideas is Mooij's understanding of the tripartite structure of psychic reality, which underpins all of Part II. The third level is reflection, which is always conditioned by language (as in Lacanian psychoanalysis). This means that the subject exists in 'lived experience', intentionally constructing and designing its unique world and reflecting on the meaningfulness\n\n Like the term Orient, Orientalism derives from the Latin word oriens (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). \"Orient\" is the opposite of Occident, a term for the Western world. In terms of the Old World, Europe was considered the Occident (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the Orient (the east). Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the Middle East' was then considered 'the Orient'. However, use of the various terms and senses derived from \"Orient\" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between \n\n has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the Arab world and Islam is a threat to that of the West.

The influence of Orientalism (in the sense used by Edward Said in his book of the same name) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to \"a lacuna\" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary. Caravetta noted especially Youssef's epistemological critique of Edward Said: Because of Said's indebtedness to Auerbach and Curtius, Youssef found his critique of orientalism ambivalent. According to Caravetta, Youssef critiqued the fact that Edward Said, very much like Auerbach and Curtius, could not help but comprehend ‘realism’ as an ‘intra-literary’ phenomenon. Youssef held that literature, in so far as it is a human product, and in so far as it works or functions in an interactive way, is a process which takes place inside society, however.

Alongside neorealism, liberal institutionalism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory since the 1990s. In contrast to neorealist scholarship which is skeptical of prospects for sustainable cooperation, neoliberalism argues that cooperation is feasible and sustainable. Liberal theories in terms of international relations attempt to explain how both peace and co-operation are possible. On the other hand, realism tells us that international communities are in chaos. It was first outlined by Kenneth Waltz in his 1979 book Theory of International Politics. Alongside neoliberalism, neorealism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives dominated international relations theory from the 1960s to the 1990s. Kant and the liberal school of thought state that international co-operation is a more rational option for states than resorting to war. The goal of liberal internationalism is to achieve global structures within the international system that are inclined towards promoting a liberal world order. It foresees a gradual transformation of world politics from anarchy to common institutions and the rule of law. Once realized, it will result in a 'peace dividend', as liberal states have relations that are characterized by non-violence, and that relations between democracies are characterized by the democratic peace theory. Liberal internationalism states that, through multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, it is possible to avoid the worst excesses of \"power politics\" in relations between nations. In addition, liberal internationalists believe that the best way to spread democracy is to treat all states equally and cooperatively, whether they are initially democratic or not. According to Abrahamsen, liberal internationalism provides more opportunities to middle powers to advance their economic, security, and political interests.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

The assumptions of dialectical and historical materialism (DHM) provide a powerful framework for knowledge generation and transformation of policies and practices in healthcare. Firstly, a Marxist perspective recognizes that social contradictions underlie the health-disease process. By incorporating research from a Marxist perspective, systematic reviews can account for the broader social determinants of health and provide a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare interventions. Secondly, studies based on a critical paradigm, rooted in Marxism, often employ complex methods inherent to dialectical guidelines. By integrating research from a Marxist perspective, systematic reviews can benefit from these complex methods and potentially explore new avenues of evidence synthesis that encompass social and political factors. The challenges may arise due to the unique nature of research developed from a Marxist perspective, which may differ from traditional biomedical research. In conclusion, incorporating research developed from a Marxist perspective of knowledge production into systematic reviews and evidence synthesis in healthcare can provide a more comprehensive understanding of health outcomes by accounting for social determinants. While it does employ various ethnographic data-gathering tools, techniques, analytical approaches, and theories, it requires a specific \"anthropological sensibility\" that distinguishes it from the procedures of normal science. To illustrate these points, a group of Techno-Anthropology students at Aalborg University conducted problem-based project work. They followed the work of a group of porters and used anthropological concepts and research strategies to gain crucial insights into the potential effects of using tracking technologies in a hospital. Military ; Political ; Economic ; Society ; Environment In Security: A New Framework for Analysis, Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and Jaap de Wilde work with five political sectors in which a securitization could take place: However, a securitization could easily involve more than one of these sectors. Concerns of terrorist infiltration are regularly cited as grounds for the tight control of borders. Even professors who advocate securitization for issues such as climate change, such as Anatol Lieven, agree that securitizing an issue can cause an overreaction by state actors, for example with the War on terror and even more so with the \"war\" on drugs and crime. Regarding the securitization of migration, researcher Ainhoa Ruiz Benedicto warns of the adverse effects for forcibly displaced persons: \"In this context of securitisation of border regions, population movement is understood and treated as a suspicious activity that needs to be controlled, monitored and registered, while the migration of often forcibly displaced people and refugees is seen as a security threat that must be intercepted.\" The field of social studies of science (STS) can contribute to defending proper scientific knowledge without succumbing to scientism, particularly in relation to health issues, through its critical approach and emphasis on examining the claims of authority made by science. Instead of blindly accepting scientific claims of authority, STS challenges these claims and encourages a thorough examination of the underlying assumptions, biases, and social contexts. By doing so, it helps to ensure that proper scientific knowledge is based on robust evidence, transparent methodologies, and ethical considerations. Moreover, the critical stance of STS does not undermine the value of scientific knowledge but rather helps to refine and define what constitutes proper scientific knowledge. Through its interdisciplinary nature, STS incorporates insights from various social science disciplines, such as sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, to offer a comprehensive understanding of science and its impact on society. It should continuously reflect on its own assumptions and methodologies to maintain its critical integrity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Structural realism holds that the nature of the international structure is defined by its ordering principle (anarchy), units of the system (states), and by the distribution of capabilities (measured by the number of great powers within the international system), with only the last being considered an independent variable with any meaningful change over time.

Waltz's original formulation of neorealism is now sometimes called Defensive Realism, while Mearsheimer's modification of the theory is referred to as Offensive Realism. Both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete, but Defensive Realism posits that most states concentrate on maintaining their security (i.e. states are security maximizers), while Offensive Realism claims that all states seek to gain as much power as possible (i.e. A foundational study in the area of defensive realism is Robert Jervis' classic 1978 article on the \"security dilemma.\" It examines how uncertainty and the offense-defense balance may heighten or soften the security dilemma. Offensive realism and defensive realism are variants of structural realism. They share the basic beliefs of survivalism, statism (state as the primary unit), self-help and anarchy. However, contrary to defensive realism, offensive realism regards states as aggressive power maximizers and not as security maximizers.

These challenges arise from the long-term legacies of civil war economies, which are often characterized by widespread illicit economic activities and the proliferation of criminal and quasi-criminal networks. There are three prevailing approaches to address these challenges in peace processes: criminalization, co-option, and neglect. It aims to disrupt the power and influence of these networks and promote the rule of law. This approach recognizes the influence and power of these actors and seeks to channel their activities towards legal and productive means. While this approach may bring short-term stability and cooperation, it also carries the risk of legitimizing criminal activities and undermining the rule of law. It is important to note that there is no clear consensus on which approach is most likely to succeed, and most countries will require a balanced combination of all three approaches. Addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic dynamics at play, as well as the political and cultural context of the conflict-affected country. In conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a multifaceted approach that combines criminalization, co-option, and neglect strategies. Securitization theorists argue that a subject that has been successfully securitized will receive disproportionate attention and resources in comparison with subjects that have not been securitized, even when these other subjects actually cause more harm. Powell described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed \"through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations\" (Powell 94). The key findings are summarized below:\n\n Terrorist acts may be considered a form of communication with victims, spectators, and the perpetrators. Since the rhetoric is largely non-verbal (though many terrorist attacks are followed by claims of responsibility and explanation), symbols play an important role in creating meaningful messages, and consequently become central to the mission and effectiveness of terrorism. O'Hair and Heath argue that \"selection of the targets of terrorism is strategic, made because of their potential rhetorical impact.”  This perspective is reinforced in the book \"Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, \n\nSome factors that indicate the world's seriousness in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 include peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance. However, according to the 2018 Global Peace Index, global peacefulness has declined for the fourth consecutive year, indicating increased political instability worldwide. Moreover, regions that enjoy sustained levels of peace, security, and prosperity are more likely to make progress towards the SDGs. To assess the world's seriousness in achieving the SDGs, it is essential to evaluate whether sufficient measures are being taken to promote peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance. Strengthening international cooperation, addressing root causes of conflicts, promoting diplomacy, and ensuring respect for human rights are some steps that can demonstrate commitment towards the SDGs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.\nB. The security paradigm of US led strategy has been the undertaking of short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community.

Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. For example, theorists suggest that advocates of space exploration could achieve more success by convincing state actors of the merits of their proposals around the rubric of security rather than science: that space exploration could be framed around how it protects humanity from looming existential threats such as meteorites, rather than around how it helps advance scientific knowledge.

Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\nB. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security.

Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

Postcolonial theory, with its focus on positional difference, subalternity, and the influence of hegemonic powers, can help move beyond a purely chronological or individualized understanding of old age. By incorporating postcolonial theory, we can examine how power dynamics and structural inequalities shape the experiences of elderly individuals. Just as postcolonial theory has shed light on the oppression and marginalization of colonized peoples, it can also illuminate the ways in which aging individuals may be marginalized or excluded by dominant societal narratives. Postcolonial theory encourages us to question traditional perspectives on old age and challenge the influence of hegemonic norms that may devalue or dismiss the experiences of the elderly. It allows us to consider the influence of cultural, social, and economic factors on the lives of older individuals, particularly in relation to concrete locations in the Global South. However, it's important to note that postcolonial theory may have blind spots, such as alleged culturalism. This means considering the lived experiences and material conditions of elderly individuals, in addition to examining the power dynamics that shape their lives. In summary, applying postcolonial theory to the study of old age can deepen our understanding by highlighting structural inequalities, power dynamics, and the influence of hegemonic norms. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the \n\n to examine its core arguments. Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital was focused on one particular strand of theorizing, namely the Subaltern Studies collective. Chibber took Subaltern Studies as a representative of the key sociological and historical arguments in postcolonial studies. His basic argument in the book is that, even though postcolonial theory advertises itself as a critique of Orientalism and Eurocentrism, in fact the theory ends up resurrecting them. In other words, postcolonial theory gives new life to Orientalist notions of the Global South, by presenting a highly exoticized and essentialized understanding of it – as fundamentally different from the West, incapable of being understood by Western categories, its people untouched by reason and rationality, etc. Chibber bases \n\n British colonialists used \"caste\" in order to \"systematize\" India's diversity and to justify colonial rule of India.

Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.\nB. The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\nC. Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.\nD.
