RBAC-Matrix uses an XrML (eXtensible Rights Markup Language) file in association with each EMR to declare and authorize access control within matrix organizations of medical institutions. The system follows a two-stage design, referred to as the master and servant stage, to process the XrML rights declaration file-based authorization of behavior, ultimately enhancing the protection of associated EMRs. These roles are the medical records Document Creator (DC) and the medical records Document Right Setting (DRS). The access right settings, determined by the DRS, are co-signed by the patient, ensuring that the declaration of rights and the use of EMR align with the specifications outlined in HIPAA. Database ; Table ; Record ; Field The DLM uses a generalized concept of a resource, which is some entity to which shared access must be controlled. This can relate to a file, a record, an area of shared memory, or anything else that the application designer chooses. A hierarchy of resources may be defined, so that a number of levels of locking can be implemented. A lock must be obtained on a parent resource before a subordinate resource can be locked. ; Circumvention of rights in the system can occur through database administration access, user administration access, tools which provide back-door access or supplier installed user accounts. Specific controls such as a review of an activity log may be required to address this specific concern. In dynamic and heterogeneous networking environments, there are several challenges that arise when trying to protect resources. Firstly, the distributed and ever-evolving nature of these environments, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, makes it difficult to ensure that resources are adequately protected. Since these environments consist of various private and public networks, with resources being accessed from anywhere, controlling access becomes complex. These malicious actors constantly find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in network systems, making it crucial to have robust protection measures in place. Traditional access control (AC) methods may not be sufficient to meet the increasing demand for privacy and security standards posed by the evolution of ubiquitous computing, Industry 4.0, and IoT applications. Each system may have its own AC model, making it difficult to integrate and enforce consistent access control policies across the heterogeneous structure. This further emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and flexible approach to access control. By utilizing tools like Eclipse (xtext), the HEAD AC metamodel can be instantiated for different models and hybrid models, demonstrating its effectiveness in resource protection. The utilization of an advanced and dynamic AC metamodel, such as HEAD, can help overcome these challenges and provide a comprehensive approach to resource protection.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college computer science.

This is a partial case of divisibility in rings. An element a that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero x such that \n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 4) ; x ≡ 5 (mod 6) 3+4j ≡ 5 (mod 6) 4j ≡ 2 (mod 6) 2j ≡ 1 (mod 3) j ≡ 2 × 1 (mod 3) j ≡ 2 (mod 3) x = 3 + 4(2 + 3k) x = 11 + 12k Consider the simple set of simultaneous congruences Now, for x ≡ 3 (mod 4) to be true, x = 3 + 4j for some integer j.

Prior to the release of Macintosh System Software (1984), file sizes were typically reported by the operating system without any prefixes. The proprietary file system format, called SpartaDOS FS (unrelated to and not compatible with MS-DOS FAT), offers full support for subdirectories, MS-DOS-like attributes (AHPS: Archived, Hidden, Protected, Subdirectory), modification date and time stamps, random access to data within a file, sparse files. The file naming convention is 8+3 (this scheme, inherited from CP/M, is normal on Atari). The logical sector size is 128 or 256 bytes in earlier versions, and 128, 256 and 512 bytes as of v. 4.40. Systems are usually configured so that unprivileged users cannot see other users files or the system's files, except for the system executables held in. Files in an OS4000 filesystem are typed, which means that the filesystem can hold several different types of file, and understands how the contents are structured. Most common are logical files which contain a record structure. These are split into sequential and random files, with random files having all records the same \n\n Prior to AmigaOS 3.5, AmigaDOS file handles maintained a 32-bit wide offset parameter (unsigned), telling where to start the next read or write operation. The biggest size for any single Amiga file under these operating systems therefore comes to 232 = 4 GiB. However, OFS-formatted disks continue to retain the 32-bit limitations, for that is an intrinsic limitation of the format as recorded on the media. An OFS datablock stores block size BSIZE-24 bytes (i.e. The rootblock is located at the physical middle of the media: block number 880 for DD disks, block 1760 for HDs. Thus, additional files can be created and saved after the file E.

In connectomics, cost is commonly quantified by the total physical length of all connections in a nervous system, or by the connection density of the network.Network function usually improves with network cost.For example, long-range axonal projections incur a significant cost, but greatly reduce the characteristic path length, and as a consequence, increase the efficiency with which information can be routed between nodes. **Edge** A connection between a pair of nodes in a graph.Also sometimes referred to as a link or arc.

Furthermore, since each edge can be selected at most twice (once by each incident vertex) the maximum number of disconnected components after step 1 is equal to half the number of vertices. Thus, a Borůvka step reduces the number of vertices in the graph by at least a factor of two and deletes at least n/2 edges where n is the number of vertices in G.

Hamiltonicity can be expressed in MSO2 by the existence of a set of edges that forms a connected 2-regular graph on all the vertices, with connectivity expressed as above and 2-regularity expressed as the incidence of two but not three distinct edges at each vertex. However, Hamiltonicity is not expressible in MSO1, because MSO1 is not capable of distinguishing complete bipartite graphs with equal numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition (which are Hamiltonian) from unbalanced complete bipartite graphs (which are not). Although not part of the definition of MSO2, orientations of undirected graphs can be represented by a technique involving Trémaux trees. As an example, the connectivity of an undirected graph can be expressed in MSO1 as the statement that, for every partition of the vertices into two nonempty subsets, there exists an edge from one subset to the other. That is, a graph is connected when it models the MSO1 sentence However, connectivity cannot be expressed in first-order graph logic, nor can it be expressed in existential MSO1 (the fragment of MSO1 in which all set quantifiers are existential and occur \n\nThis is quite different from two other common network architectures: random (Poisson) and exponential distributions.The term scale-free refers to the fact that the connectivity of nodes in the network is invariant with respect to the size of the network.Complex systems can be depicted as a network of lower-complexity interacting components or modules, each of which can be reduced further to simpler analyzable canonical motifs (such as feedback and feedforward loops, or negative and positive autoregulation); however, a central property of complex systems is that simplifying their structures by identifying and characterizing the individual nodes and links or even simpler substructures does not necessarily yield a predictable understanding of a system’s behavior. The nodes, for example, can be metabolites that are linked by the enzymes that cause their transformations, transcription factors that are linked by the genes whose expression they influence, or proteins in an interaction network that are linked by cofactors that facilitate interactions or by thermodynamic forces that facilitate their physical association. This is quite different from two other common network architectures: random (Poisson) and exponential distributions.A random network is depicted on the left, and its Poisson distribution of the number of nodal connections (k) is shown in the graph below it.A scale-free network is depicted on the right, and its power law distribution of the number of nodal connections (k) is shown in the graph below it.Highly connected nodes (hubs) are lightly shaded.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college computer science.

Premise#n Conclusion This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions) to form an infinite set of inference rules. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a hypothetical statement: \"if the premises hold, then the conclusion holds.\" Satisfiability in the implicational propositional calculus is trivial, because every formula is satisfiable: just set all variables to true. Falsifiability in the implicational propositional calculus is NP-complete, meaning that validity (tautology) is co-NP-complete. If one succeeds, then it is indeed not a tautology. If one fails, then it is a tautology. Then since E is false and F→E is true, we get \n\n setting L to greater than the length of this procedure P, we have that the required length of a program to print x as stated in K(x) ≥ L as being at least L is then less than the amount L since the string x was printed by the procedure P. This is a contradiction. So it is not possible for the proof system S to prove K(x) ≥ L for L arbitrarily large, in particular, for L larger than the length of the procedure P, (which is finite). Proof: We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in S by some procedure function NthProof(int n) which takes as input n \n\n¬P is equivalent to P → ⊥ ; P ∧ Q is equivalent to (P → (Q → ⊥)) → ⊥ ; P ∨ Q is equivalent to (P → Q) → Q ; P ↔ Q is equivalent to ((P → Q) → ((Q → P) → ⊥)) → ⊥ Implication alone is not functionally complete as a logical operator because one cannot form all other two-valued truth functions from it. Formulas over the resulting set of connectives {→, ⊥} are called f-implicational. If P and Q are propositions, then: Since the above operators are known to be functionally complete, it follows that any truth function can be expressed in terms of → and ⊥.

This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single process might be underway at any time. Virtual memory systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the virtual address space beyond the available amount of RAM using paging or swapping to secondary storage. Memory management within an address space is generally categorized as either manual memory management or automatic memory management. Thus, additional files can be created and saved after the file E. If the file B is deleted, a second region of ten blocks of free space is created, and the disk becomes fragmented. ; Free the formerly allocated memory block. The module can interpret the handle internally by dividing it into pool index, memory block index and a version. The pool and memory block index allow fast access to the corresponding block with the handle, while the version, which is incremented at each new allocation, allows detection of handles whose memory block is already freed (caused by handles retained too long). The application can allocate, access and free memory through the following interface: \n\n memory space; and length, or its size. The heap requires enough system memory to fill its entire length, and its base can never change. Thus, any large areas of unused memory are wasted. The heap can get \"stuck\" in this position if a small used segment exists at the end of the heap, which could waste any amount of address space. On lazy memory allocation schemes, such as those often found in the Linux operating system, a large heap does not necessarily reserve the equivalent system memory; it will only do so at the first write time (reads of non-mapped memory pages return zero). Therefore, constraining the number of processors in the system, we can still apply the same principle and divide the data into bigger chunks to calculate the product of two matrices.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college computer science.

With gcc on Linux, 80-bit extended precision is the \n\n The fact that floating-point numbers cannot precisely represent all real numbers, and that floating-point operations cannot precisely represent true arithmetic operations, leads to many surprising situations. This is related to the finite precision with which computers generally represent numbers. Squaring this number gives 0.010000000298023226097399174250313080847263336181640625 exactly. This is called arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. ; Floating-point expansions are another way to get a greater precision, benefiting from the floating-point hardware: a number is represented as an unevaluated sum of several floating-point numbers. ; Some simple rational numbers (e.g., 1/3 and 1/10) cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point, no matter what the precision is. Software packages that perform rational arithmetic represent numbers as fractions with integral numerator and \n\n Assume that all floating point operations use standard IEEE 754 double-precision arithmetic. Both the naïve algorithm and two-pass algorithm compute these values correctly. While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of the naïve algorithm, further increasing the offset makes the error catastrophic. Consider the sample (109 + 4, 109 + 7, 109 + 13, 109 + 16). This is a serious problem with naïve algorithm and is due to catastrophic cancellation in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college computer science.

Some file managers contain features analogous to web browsers, including forward and back navigational buttons. Some file managers provide network connectivity via protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, NFS, SMB or WebDAV. This is achieved by allowing the user to browse for a file server (connecting and accessing the server's file system like a local file system) or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols. Many system administrators allocate for each user also a personal primary group that has the same name as the user's login name, and often also has the same numeric GID as the user's UID. Such personal groups have no other members and make collaboration with other users in shared directories easier, by allowing users to habitually work with. This way, newly created files can have by default write permissions enabled for group members, because this will normally only enable write access for members of the personal group, that is only for the file's owner. However, if a file is created in a shared directory that belongs to another group and has the setgid bit set, then the created file will automatically become writable to members of that directory's group as well. 1) A user wishing to share a file or update a freesite \"inserts\" the file \"to the network\" ; 2) After \"insertion\" is finished, the publishing node is free to shut down, because the file is stored in the network. No single node is responsible for the content; instead, it is replicated to many different nodes. (Here, the block size is unimportant.)\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college computer science. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD.
