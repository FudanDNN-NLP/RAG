This is caused by the scattering and absorption of blue light by the Earth's atmosphere. However, on rare occasions, dust or smoke aerosols in the atmosphere can cause the extinction of red light to exceed that of blue light. This is because the dust particles in the Martian atmosphere primarily scatter blue light in a near-forward direction, resulting in the blue coloration of the sunset. In summary, the blue appearance of the sun and moon on rare occasions is a result of the selective extinction of light, with blue light being scattered and absorbed differently by atmospheric particles. Similarly, the blue sunsets on Mars are caused by the scattering of blue light in the Martian atmosphere by dust aerosols. Light from the sky is a result of the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight, which results in a blue color perceived by the human eye. On a sunny day, Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, where it is darkest around the zenith and bright near the horizon. Hence, fewer particles scatter the zenithal sunbeam, and thus the light remains a darker blue. As a result, the cloud base can vary from a very light to very dark grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much light is being reflected \n\n back out before it is absorbed.

These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. - The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later general relativity) uses the principle of rela\n\n ensures that an object at rest on the Earth's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition.

This work was furthered by ancient Indian and medieval Islamic physicists, before gaining great strides during the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, culminating in the formulation of Newton's law of gravity. This was superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in the early 20th century. Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner gravitas (heaviness). In the 6th century CE, Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus modified the Aristotelian concept of gravity with the theory of impetus. In the 7th century, Indian astronomer Brahmagupta spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

Furthermore, Mars has an atmosphere containing abundant amounts of carbon and nitrogen, both essential elements needed for life.

The mass of the comet is estimated to be about 300 Mt. Barring a catastrophic breakup or major splitting event, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700 years) at its current rate of mass loss. Radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory during the comet's 2010 apparition revealed that the nucleus is highly elongated and rotates over an 18-hour period.

In astronomical terms, the impact would have been of moderate velocity. \"When warmed by the Sun, dry ice [frozen carbon dioxide] deep in the comet's body turns to gas jetting off the comet and dragging water ice with it.\" It is now believed that some of the dust, icy chunks, and other material coming off the ends of the comet are moving slowly enough to be captured by even the weak gravity of the comet. This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. They were the remains of a comet that had passed within the Roche limit of Jupiter, and had been torn apart by tidal forces. While Galileo was still a long way from Jupiter, it was perfectly positioned to observe this event, whereas terrestrial telescopes had to wait to see the impact sites as they rotated into view because it would occur on Jupiter's night side.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The Viking Labeled Release (LR) experiment conducted in 1976 yielded positive responses for extant microbial life on the Martian surface. Although this conclusion was highly controversial at the time and remains so, it provided initial support for the possibility of life on Mars. Since then, follow-on missions have primarily focused on studying the Martian environment and searching for signs of water. Water is a crucial requirement for life as we know it. Evidence suggests that liquid water existed on the Martian surface in the past and may still exist in the form of briny water today. The presence of water increases the likelihood of habitability and the potential for life to exist on Mars. In terms of methane, which is another important factor in the search for life, recent observations have detected the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Methane has biological sources on Earth, such as from microbial activity, although it can also be produced through geological processes. The detection of methane on Mars has sparked interest and debate as to its origin, with one possibility being the existence of microbial life beneath the Martian surface. Furthermore, the discovery of organic compounds on Mars has also contributed to the discussion. Recent studies have identified organic molecules in Martian rocks and sediment, indicating that organic chemistry processes have occurred on Mars. Although the exact source and nature of these organic molecules are still under investigation, their presence suggests the possibility of past or present life on Mars. It is important to note that the existence of water, methane, and organics on Mars does not confirm the presence of life conclusively. However, these findings significantly improve the case for the potential existence of life on the planet. They highlight Mars as a potentially habitable environment that merits further exploration and scientific investigation. Overall, recent findings regarding Martian water, methane, and organics provide strong indications that life on Mars is a possibility. While the Viking LR experiment remains controversial and its results are debated, the presence of these key elements necessary for life increases the likelihood of extant or past life on Mars. Further research and exploration missions will continue to shed light on this intriguing question. Also, in some places dust is blown out of in geyser-like eruptions that are sometimes called \"spiders.\" It freezes out directly onto the surface of the permanent polar cap, which is made of water ice covered with layers of dust and sand. The deposit begins as a layer of dusty CO2 frost. The dust and sand particles caught in the frost slowly sink. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. ,\n\n Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. There is good evidence that this mantle is ice-rich. The shapes of the polygons common on many surfaces suggest ice-rich soil. High levels of hydrogen (probably from water) have been found with Mars Odyssey. The Phoenix Lander found water ice directly since it landed in a field of polygons and its landing rockets exposed a pure ice surface. Theory had predicted that ice would be found under a few cm of soil. This cracking of ice-rich ground is predicted based on physical processes. \"This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced,\" said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S. If something breaks away, something else [could] breakaway, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen.\" Hollywood has done a good job of filling our minds with the destruction that would be and has been unleashed upon the Earth through a collision with anyone of the millions of stellar bodies that share the solar system with us.

The Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, being 27% the size of Earth. The giant-impact theory hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a Mars-sized body, dubbed Theia, with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt (inclination) and velocity of rotation. The Rare Earth hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative \n\n Meteoroid collisions with solid Solar System objects, including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede, and most small moons and asteroids, create impact craters, which are the dominant geographic features of many of those objects. On other planets and moons with active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io, and Titan, visible impact craters may become eroded, buried, or transformed by tectonics over time. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth. Molten terrestrial material ejected from a meteorite impact crater can cool and solidify into an object known as a tektite. These are often mistaken for meteorites. A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is \"just right\". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible. If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean tides resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to tidal pools, which may be essential for the formation of complex life, though this is far from certain. A large satellite \n\n  An impact structure is a generally circular or craterlike geologic structure of deformed bedrock or sediment produced by impact on a planetary surface, whatever the stage of erosion of the structure. In contrast, an impact crater is the surface expression of an impact structure. In many cases, on Earth, the impact crater has been destroyed by erosion, leaving only the deformed rock or sediment of the impact structure behind. This is the fate of almost all old impact craters on Earth, unlike the ancient pristine craters preserved on the Moon and other geologically inactive rocky bodies with old surfaces in the Solar System. Impact structure is synonymous with the less commonly used term astrobleme meaning \"star wound\". In an impact structure, the typical visible and topographic expressions of an impact crater are no longer obvious. Any meteorite fragments that may once have been present would be long since eroded away. Possible impact structures may be initially recognized by their anomalous geological character or geophysical expression. These may still be confirmed as impact structures by the presence of shocked minerals (particularly shocked quartz), shatter cones, geochemical evidence of extraterrestrial material or other methods.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The April Lyrids are the strongest annual shower of meteors from debris of a long-period comet, mainly because as far as other intermediate long-period comets go (200–10,000 years), this one has a relatively short orbital period of \n\n As a comet is heated during close passes to the Sun, outgassing of its icy components also releases solid debris too large to be swept away by radiation pressure and the solar wind. If Earth's orbit sends it through that trail of debris, which is composed mostly of fine grains of rocky material, there is likely to be a meteor shower as Earth passes through. Denser trails of debris produce quick but intense meteor showers and less dense trails create longer but less intense showers. Typically, the density of the debris trail is related to how long ago the parent comet released the material. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids, the Delta Aquariids, and the Iota Aquariids. Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on 21 April and as late as 12 May. The parent body of the shower is Halley's Comet, a periodic comet. The Eta Aquariids are a meteor shower associated with Halley's Comet. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley's Comet hundreds of years ago. Although this shower is not as spectacular as the Leonids may \n\n2021: ; CAMS networks in New Zealand and Chile detected a predicted outburst of meteors from comet 15P/Finlay on September 27-30, the first time meteors were seen from this comet and the new shower is called the \"Arids\" (number 1130).

This encounter with the dust trails or Filament of 109P/Swift-Tuttle was not anticipated 2020: ; 1) CAMS detected a new shower now called the gamma Piscis Austrinids ; 2) CAMS detected rho Phoenicids, a shower previously known only from radar observations.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

These conditions create an environment where charged particles, mainly protons and electrons, gain high energies and are able to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun. The high temperatures in the solar corona, reaching millions of degrees Celsius, result from the intense heating caused by the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy. This process, known as magnetic reconnection, occurs when the magnetic field lines in the corona become twisted and tangled. When these lines reconnect, they release a large amount of energy as heat, heating up the surrounding plasma. The strong magnetic fields in the corona also contribute to the formation of solar wind. As the magnetic field lines extend outward from the Sun's surface, they create a magnetic pressure that dominates both ion and electron pressure. In summary, the high temperatures and strong magnetic fields in the solar corona contribute to the formation of solar wind by providing the energy and pressure needed for particles to escape the Sun's gravitational pull. This solar wind then expands through the Solar System, carrying charged particles and magnetic field lines with it into interstellar space. Rather than air, the solar wind is a stream of charged particles—a plasma—ejected from the upper atmosphere of the sun at a rate of 400 km/s. These particles are able to escape the Sun's gravity, in part because of the high temperature of the corona, but also because of high kinetic energy that particles gain through a process that is not well understood. Planets require large magnetic fields in order to reduce the ionization of their upper atmosphere by the solar wind. Long-period comets have highly eccentric orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands of years, so they are usually discovered only months before they pass through the inner Solar System and return to the distant reaches of the outer Solar System, which is too little time to plan and launch a mission. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the antitail, only when it seems that it is directed towards the Sun. At the same time, the ion tail, made of gases, always points along the streamlines of the solar wind as it is strongly affected by the magnetic field of the plasma of the solar wind.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

This study detected both the local wake and a large-scale overdensity in the northern Galactic hemisphere, which are referred to as the \"collective response\". The location of the wake observed in the study is consistent with an N-body simulation that includes the dynamical effect of the LMC on the Milky Way halo. This detection of a strong local wake provides independent evidence that the Magellanic clouds, including the LMC, are on their first orbit around the Milky Way. These findings indicate that the outer halo of the Milky Way is not in dynamical equilibrium, challenging the assumption that is often made. Overall, this study provides evidence supporting the existence of the collective response and local wake resulting from the gravitational interactions between the LMC and the Milky Way. NGC 2197 is an centrally condensed open cluster within the Large Magellanic Cloud, in the Dorado constellation. As the stars traveled away, they went into normal stellar evolution, with one of them becoming a red giant and engulfing the other and forming one giant star &mdash; a blue straggler. In 2008, a team of astronomers found a match between the star's chemical composition and the characteristics of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Later observations using the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the star originated from the Milky Way's galactic center. The Taurus Molecular Cloud is only 140 pc (430 ly) away from Earth, making it possibly the nearest large star formation region.

If that wasn't bad enough, astronomers have discovered that one of these potential doomsday harbingers looks eerily like a skull. This isn't our first encounter with the 2,000 foot across TB145, it passed by us on Halloween 2015 at a distance of about 300,000 miles. 300,000 miles may sound like not that close, but that's about the average distance the moon orbits the Earth. Its closest encounters with us are at 3-year intervals, according to space.com. Astronomers believe this creepy cosmic companion maybe a dead comet, meaning that it has exhausted all of the volatile chemicals that are blown away from the core by solar winds. \"We found that the object reflects about six percent of the light it receives from the sun,\"; said Vishnu Reddy, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona. That is similar to fresh asphalt, and while here on Earth we think that is pretty dark, it is brighter than a typical comet which reflects only 3 to 5 percent of the light. \"That suggests it could be cometary in origin –- but as there is no coma evident, the conclusion is it is a dead comet.” said Reddy. But rest easy as TB145 will stay a safe 24 million miles away this coming fall, which is about one quarter the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Our neighbor in space, the planet Mars, has been the subject of humanity’s fascination over many years. In our solar system, this red planet is the fourth one nearest to the sun and our planet’s second closest neighbor after the terrestrial planet Venus. But aside from its proximity to our own planet and its beautiful reddish appearance, our interest in unraveling the mysteries of Mars really stems from the similarities it shares with our own planet and the potential for its habitability.

Pickering, who had seven years earlier discovered Phoebe, announced the discovery of a tenth satellite of Saturn, which he promptly named Themis. However, no other astronomer has ever confirmed Pickering's claim. Pickering attempted to compute an orbit, which showed a fairly high inclination (39.1° to the ecliptic), fairly large eccentricity (0.23) and a semi-major axis (1457000 km) slightly less than that of Hyperion. The period was supposedly 20.85 days, with prograde motion. Pickering estimated the diameter at 61 km, but since he also gave 68 km as the diameter of Phoebe, he was clearly overestimating \n\n of climatic and geologic change on Mars and its astrobiological potential, which could be revealed through signs of preserved ancient microbial life or even the possibility of living organisms, if Mars ever harbored life. Ice is also a critical natural resource that could eventually supply hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. These elements could also provide resources for backup life support, civil engineering, mining, manufacturing, and, eventually, agriculture on Mars. Transporting water from Earth to deep space is extremely costly, so a local resource is essential to sustainable surface exploration. \"In addition to supporting plans for future human missions to Mars, learning more about subsurface ice will bring significant opportunities for scientific discovery\", said Eric Ianson, NASA Planetary Science Division Deputy Director \n\n heavily cratered. The images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550 km and numerous smaller impact craters. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe &ndash; the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe.

Voids typically have a diameter of 10 to 100 megaparsecs (30 to 300 million light years); particularly large voids, defined by the absence of rich superclusters, are sometimes called supervoids. They were first discovered in 1978 in a pioneering study by Stephen Gregory and Laird A. Thompson at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.
