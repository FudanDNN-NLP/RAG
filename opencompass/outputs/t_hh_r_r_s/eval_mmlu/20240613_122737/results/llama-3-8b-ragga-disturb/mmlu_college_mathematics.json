As a result of these influencing variables, this study concludes that PD evaluation should rely on graphical tests that involve the production of geometric shapes, such as spirals or meanders, in free conditions or following a printed trace. From handwritten ink traces, both static (size, curvature, slant) and dynamic (velocity, acceleration, pressure, fluency, duration) features can be extracted. However, improving the performance obtained with only static features should be considered a goal worthy of attention, since (1) analyzing old writing or drawings from the subject (available only on the paper) could be useful for reconstructing the patient’s medical history or to date the onset of the disease; (2) some subjects, especially elderly ones, do not feel comfortable writing on a graphic tablet, and this can lead to errors in assessment. addressed this goal by asking a group of patients and healthy subjects to retrace a set of drawings (spirals and meanders) printed on paper. From the collected data, they computed a set of static features, calculated on the basis of some spatial parameters, mainly based on the difference between the printed trace and that created by the writer. Their results show that a better classification performance (67% global accuracy) could be achieved through the meander analysis using a SVM classifier. However, the classification accuracy reached by the methods proposed by Pereira is not satisfactory for application in a real scenario, and the used classifiers provide no clue about the way the decision is taken. The work proposed aims to develop a system that provides explicit criteria for discriminating between healthy and unhealthy patients handwriting productions, while exhibiting comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods. We tackle the problem by using for the classification step Evolutionary Algorithms, in particular the Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) approach [22,23], which allowed us to construct an explicit representation of the problem, built from the considered features and a predetermined set of functions. Figure 1 shows an example of a simple CGP network, where six nodes are arranged in a 2 × 3 rectangular format. The graph has two inputs ( x 0 and x 1 ) and four outputs ( y 0 , y 1 , y 2 , y 3 ). Each node is numbered progressively (starting from zero) and is associated with a particular function, chosen among a set of predefined ones (these can be algebraic, logic, non-linear, etc.). In order to manipulate this kind of structure (the phenotype), CGP makes use of a different representation, called the genotype, made up of a fixed length array of integers representing a sequence of chromosomes (the individuals of the population) (bottom part of Figure 1). It is noteworthy that when genotypes are decoded into phenotypes not all the nodes are connected in the path from inputs to outputs, and therefore, with the CGP approach, one genotype can correspond to different\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" +1.0000 + 0.0000i ; +0.4000 + 0.9000i ; &minus;0.6500 + 0.7200i +1.3608 + 2.0222i ; &minus;0.3658 + 2.4838i ; &minus;2.3858 &minus; 0.0284i +2.6597 + 2.7137i ; +0.5977 + 0.8225i ; &minus;0.6320&minus;1.6716i +2.2704 + 0.3880i ; +0.1312 + 1.3128i ; +0.2821 &minus; 1.5015i +2.5428 &minus; 0.0153i ; +0.2044 + 1.3716i ; +0.2056 &minus; 1.3721i +2.5874 + 0.0000i ; +0.2063 + 1.3747i ; +0.2063 &minus; 1.3747i +2.5874 + 0.0000i ; +0.2063 + 1.3747i ; +0.2063 &minus; 1.3747i ; } } This example is from the reference 1992.

Substitute this in the second equation since we are looking for a solution to both equations. Subtract 3 from both sides (this is permitted in modular arithmetic) We simplify by dividing by the greatest common divisor of 4,2 and 6. Division by 2 yields: The Euclidean modular multiplicative inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2. After multiplying both sides with the inverse, we obtain: or For the above to be true: j = 2 + 3k for some integer k.

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used in all sciences to model phenomena. For the purpose of exposition, we give an example physical problem and the accompanying boundary value problem (BVP). Even if the reader is unfamiliar with the notation, the purpose is merely to show what a BVP looks like when written down. Here, the domain is the square [0,1] × [0,1]. This particular problem can be solved exactly on paper, so there is no need for a computer. However, this is an exceptional case, and most BVPs cannot be solved exactly.

One often refers to the trivial object (of a specified category) since every trivial object is isomorphic to any other (under a unique isomorphism). Additionally, consider for instance the unit circle S, and the action on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the rightmost map (from A to B) has kernel {0}; that is, if and only if that map is a monomorphism (injective, or one-to-one). The kernel of the rightmost map is C. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the image of the leftmost map (from B to C) is all of C; that is, if and only if that map is an epimorphism (surjective, or onto). ; Therefore, the sequence 0 → X → Y → 0 is exact if and only if the map from X to Y is both a monomorphism and epimorphism (that is, a bimorphism), and thus, in many cases, an isomorphism from X to Y. To understand the definition, it is helpful to consider relatively simple cases where the sequence is finite and begins or ends with the trivial group. Traditionally, this, along with the single identity element, is denoted 0 (additive notation, usually when the groups are abelian), or denoted 1 (multiplicative notation). In set theory, an arbitrary permutation of the elements of a set X is an automorphism. The automorphism group of X is also called the symmetric group on X. ; In elementary arithmetic, the set of integers, Z, considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group G there is a natural group homomorphism G →\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

This is an inductive definition on n: the base case is Cp,1(x) = x − α where α is the lexicographically minimal primitive element of Fp. The notion of lexicographical ordering used is the following: Since there does not appear to be any natural mathematical criterion that would single out one monic primitive polynomial satisfying the compatibility conditions over all the others, the imposition of lexicographical ordering in the definition of the Conway polynomial should be regarded as a convention. Now one proves by induction on the leading monomial in lexicographic order, that any nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial P of degree d can be written as polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. Since P is symmetric, its leading monomial has weakly decreasing exponents, so it is some X&thinsp;λ with λ a partition of d .

(For example, has a critical point at , but it has neither a maximum nor a minimum there, whereas has a critical point at and a minimum and a maximum, respectively, there.) An alternative approach, called the first derivative test, involves considering the sign of the f on each side of the critical point. The theorem can be formulated effectively. Any conic section defined over F with a rational point in F is a rational curve. Drawing a line with slope t from (−1,0), y = t(x+1), substituting it in the equation of the ellipse, factoring, and solving for x, we obtain which may be easily obtained directly by homogenizing the above equation. Many of the curves on Wikipedia's list of curves are rational and hence have similar rational parameterizations. In analytic geometry, any equation involving the coordinates specifies a subset of the plane, namely the solution set for the equation, or locus. For example, the equation y = x corresponds to the set of all the points on the plane whose x-coordinate and y-coordinate are equal. These points form a line, and y = x is said to be the equation for this line. In general, linear equations involving x and y specify lines, quadratic equations specify conic sections, and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures. Usually, a single equation corresponds to a curve on the plane. In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a surface, and a curve must be specified as the intersection of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of parametric equations.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

In particular, we compare the LT with a similar iterative but linear method based on Rytov approximation. In order to address this technical challenges, previously we developed a localization algorithm called FALCON<sup>1, 2</sup> using a quasi-continuous localization model with sparsity prior on image space. Here, we proposed a new localization algorithm using annihilating filter-based low rank Hankel structured matrix approach (ALOHA). According to ALOHA principle, sparsity in image domain implies the existence of rank-deficient Hankel structured matrix in Fourier space. Thanks to this fundamental duality, our new algorithm can perform data-adaptive PSF estimation and deconvolution of Fourier spectrum, followed by truly grid-free localization using spectral estimation technique. Furthermore, all these optimizations are conducted on Fourier space only. Based on the class of complex gradient-Laplace operators, we show the design of a non-separable two-dimensional wavelet basis from a single and analytically defined generator wavelet function. Finally, we show how to find a compact multiscale primal sketch of the image, and how to reconstruct an image from it. First, we exploit the steerability of the transform to obtain histograms of the subbands independent of the local orientation; i.e., we select the direction of maximal response as the reference orientation. The distribution of the responses to various orientations is expected to capture better the local geometric structure. The study consists of two main parts: the construction of random vector models on the basis of their invariance under coordinate transformations, and a study of the consequences of conducting a wavelet analysis of such random models. In the latter part, after briefly examining the effects of standard wavelets on the proposed random fields, we go on to introduce a new family of Laplacian-like vector wavelets that in a way duplicate the covariant-structure and whitening relations governing our random models. We propose an amplitude-phase representation of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) which provides an intuitive interpretation of the associated complex wavelet coefficients. The representation, in particular, is based on the shifting action of the group of fractional Hilbert transforms (fHT) which allow us to extend the notion of arbitrary phase-shifts beyond pure sinusoids. We explicitly characterize this shifting action for a particular family of Gabor-like wavelets which, in effect, links the corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier analysis. We then extend these ideas to the bivariate DT-CWT based on certain directional extensions of the fHT. In order to extend the class of problems that can profit of wavelet-based techniques, we propose to build new families of wavelets that behave like an arbitrary scale-covariant operator. We give necessary conditions for the scale-covariant operator to admit our wavelet construction, and we provide examples of new wavelets that can be obtained with our method. First, we introduce a problem-specific type of wavelet basis, for which we coin the term \"activelets\". The design of these wavelets is inspired by the form of the canonical hemodynamic response function. We present an iterative deconvolution algorithm that minimizes a functional with a non-quadratic wavelet-domain regularization term. ; it is sufficiently general to cover arbitrary choices of wavelet bases (non-orthonormal or redundant). The resulting procedure alternates between the following two steps: 1. a wavelet-domain Landweber iteration with subband-dependent step-sizes; 2. a denoising operation with subband-dependent thresholding functions. In particular, we present one of the first applications of wavelet-regularized\n\n Let V be the three-dimensional vector space defined over the field F . The projective plane P(V) = PG(2, F) consists of the one-dimensional vector subspaces of V , called points, and the two-dimensional vector subspaces of V , called lines. Fix a basis for V so that we may describe its vectors as coordinate triples (with respect to that basis). A one-dimensional vector subspace consists of a non-zero vector and all of its scalar multiples. With respect to this basis, the \n\nλ is the longitude of the point to be projected; ; φ is the latitude of the point to be projected; ; λ0 is the longitude of the central meridian, ; φ0 is the latitude chosen to be the origin along λ0; ; φ1 is the latitude whose parallel is chosen to have correct scale. block per distinct eigenvalue. For example if T is a positive matrix with spectral radius r then the Perron–Frobenius theorem asserts that r ∈ σ(T). The associated spectral projection P = P(r;T) is also positive and by mutual orthogonality no other spectral projection can have a positive row or column. In fact TP = rP and (T/r)n → P as n → ∞ so this projection P (which is called the Perron projection) approximates (T/r)n as n increases, and each of its columns is an eigenvector of T. More generally if T is a compact operator then all non-zero points in \n\nIf d is a positive integer then P(a0,a1,...,an) is isomorphic to P(da0,da1,...,dan). This is a property of the Proj construction; geometrically it corresponds to the d-tuple Veronese embedding. So without loss of generality one may assume that the degrees ai have no common factor. ; Suppose that a0,a1,...,an have no common factor, and that d is a common factor of all the ai with i≠j, then P(a0,a1,...,an) is isomorphic to P(a0/d,...,aj-1/d,aj,aj+1/d,...,an/d) (note that d is coprime to aj; otherwise the isomorphism does not hold). So one may further assume that any set of n variables ai have no common factor. In this case the weighted projective space is called well-formed. ; The only singularities of weighted projective space are cyclic quotient singularities. ; A weighted projective space is a Q-Fano variety and a toric variety. ; The weighted projective space P(a0,a1,...,an) is isomorphic to the quotient of projective space by the group that is the product of the groups of roots of unity of orders a0,a1,...,an acting diagonally.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.
