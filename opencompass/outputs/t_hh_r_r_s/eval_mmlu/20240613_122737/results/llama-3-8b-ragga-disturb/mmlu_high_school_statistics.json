In probability theory, a random variable is defined as a quantity whose values are random and to which a probability distribution is assigned. It can be thought of as a function that maps outcomes from a sample space to possible values of the variable. Random variables play a crucial role in probability theory by allowing us to assign probabilities to different outcomes or events. By defining and studying the properties of random variables, we can quantify uncertainty and make predictions about the likelihood of certain events occurring. In mathematical statistics, random variables are used to study data and draw conclusions about populations based on samples. We can represent this situation using a random variable where each outcome corresponds to a specific value. The probabilities associated with each outcome can be described using a probability distribution. In this case, our sample space would be Ω = {H, T} and Y would take on values from this set based on the actual outcome of the coin toss. [Reference: Adapted from \"Probability Theory: A Concise Course\" by Y.A. If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, ) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. The mode is not necessarily unique to a given discrete distribution, since the probability mass function may take the same maximum value at several points \n\n  If a numerical property, and any sample of data from it, could take on any value from a continuous range, instead of, for example, just integers, then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range, even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range, is called the mean of the probability distribution. A most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode (the three M's ), are equal to each other. This equality does not hold for other probability distributions, as illustrated for the log-normal distribution here. It is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory, often used to analyze and interpret data. The cumulative probability from the leftmost point of the curve up to a specific point is often calculated using Z-scores, which represent the number of standard deviations a value is away from the mean. Unlike median, the concept of mode makes sense for any random variable assuming values from a vector space, including the real numbers (a one-dimensional vector space) and the integers (which can be considered embedded in the reals).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

One such type is beta error, also known as Type II error. The probability of committing a beta error is denoted by the Greek letter beta (β) and is inversely related to power, which represents the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Minimizing sampling error is crucial in obtaining accurate and reliable results, and this can be achieved through careful sample selection and increasing the sample size. Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls. For example, to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect, the F-test's p-values closely approximate the permutation test's p-values: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced. The ANOVA F-test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions. For a type II error probability of β, the corresponding statistical power is 1 &minus; β. For example, if experiment E has a statistical power of 0.7, and experiment F has a statistical power of 0.95, then there is a stronger probability that experiment E had a type II error than experiment F. This reduces experiment E's sensitivity to detect significant effects. However, experiment E is consequently more reliable than experiment F due to its lower probability of a type I error. It can be equivalently thought of as the probability of accepting the alternative hypothesis then power cannot be calculated unless probabilities are known for \n\n the type I error rate if appropriate measures are not taken. Such measures typically involve applying a higher threshold of stringency to reject a hypothesis in order to compensate for the multiple comparisons being made (e.g. Thus, for example, a given study may be well powered to detect a certain effect size when only one test is to be made, but the same effect size may have much lower power if several tests are to be performed. This concept is closely related to the probability of observing the true population parameter. Therefore, there is a 5% chance of observing a value that does not represent the true parameter. This reflected a probability of 1 in 20 that the null hypothesis (no effect or no difference) was rejected based on the results from the study sample. However, in certain cases with multiple associations being tested, p-values may be adjusted downward to account for the increased chances of false discovery. To address the possibility of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually incorrect (Type II error), researchers calculate the power of their study. Power represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a true treatment effect or difference between observed groups. By calculating power and designing the study size accordingly, researchers can minimize the risk of Type II errors.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

According to current standards, a 5-foot 1-inch woman's ideal weight ranges from 95 to 115 pounds, while a man's ranges from 101 to 118 pounds. If you are large-boned, you weigh more than someone else of the same height who is small-boned. To measure your frame, Met Life indicates that you should place a finger on either side of your elbow with your arm upright. The distance between your fingers should be between 2¼ inches and 2½ inches for a medium-framed woman who is 5 feet 1 inch. If the space is any less than that, you are small-boned, and if it is any more than that, you are large-boned. According to Rush University Medical Center, the best indication of whether or not you are at your ideal weight, no matter how tall you are, is your body mass index, or BMI. Regardless of height, men should have a waist circumference of less than 40 inches and women should have one less than 35 inches if they are not pregnant. If your waist measures more than that, you may be at risk for coronary artery disease, high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Most people don’t realize that when measuring your height and comparing it to a standardized chart, the chart assumes that your height is actually one inch more than you stand in your bare feet. In addition, standard height and weight charts generally don't apply to individuals under 25 years of age or the elderly. Rush University Medical Center' height and weight charts and the Hamwi formula provide similar results. The University's chart and the Hamwi calculator both indicate that a man should weigh between 101 and 123 pounds if he is 5 feet 1 inch tall. In contrast, Met Life's charts were revised in 1983 and now indicate that a 5-foot 1-inch woman's weight may range from 106 to 140 pounds, depending on her frame size. Met Life doesn't provide weight ranges for men under 5 feet 2 inches. In this group of children, many years of GH therapy result in an average increase in adult height of 4–7 cm (1.57–2.76 inches) at a cost of $5000–$40,000 per year.Some have arbitrarily defined ISS clinically as having a height at least 2.25 standard deviations below normal for children of the same age and a predicted adult height that is less than 2.25 standard deviations below normal.Prader-Willi syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease associated with growth failure, obesity, and carbohydrate intolerance. In clinical trials, GH treatment has been shown to increase final height in girls with Turner syndrome by 10–15 cm (4–6 inches). Because girls with Turner syndrome also have either absent or rudimentary ovaries, GH must be judiciously combined with gonadal steroids to achieve maximal height. in which the child’s height remains more than 2 standard deviations below normal at 2 years of age. This is a heterogeneous population that has in common no identifiable cause of the short stature. Some have arbitrarily defined ISS clinically as having a height at least 2.25 standard deviations below normal for children of the same age and a predicted adult height that is less than 2.25 standard deviations below normal. In this group of children, many years of GH therapy result in an average increase in adult height of 4–7 cm (1.57–2.76 inches) at a cost of $5000–$40,000 per year.Treatment of children with short stature should be carried out by specialists experienced in GH administration.Dose requirements vary with the condition being treated, with GH-deficient children typically being most responsive. It is unlikely that when the scale reads 80 kg, the person weighs exactly 80.0 kg. In normal rounding to the nearest value, the scale's showing 80 kg indicates a weight between 79.5 kg and 80.5 kg. In clinical trials, GH treatment has been found to increase final height in girls with Turner syndrome by 10-15 cm (4-6 inches). Since girls with Turner syndrome also typically have absent or rudimentary ovaries, GH treatment is usually combined with gonadal steroids to maximize height outcomes. This condition is clinically defined as having a height at least 2.25 standard deviations below normal for children of the same age, with a predicted adult height that is less than 2.25 standard deviations below normal. GH therapy in children with ISS has been shown to result in an average increase in adult height of 4-7 cm (1.57-2.76 inches) over many years of treatment. These conditions involve cases where a child's height remains more than 2 standard deviations below normal at 2 years of age.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

Like the lognormal distribution, log-t or log-Student distribution and Weibull distribution, the log-Cauchy distribution is a special case of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind. The log-Cauchy is actually a special case of the log-t distribution, similar to the Cauchy distribution being a special case of the Student's t distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a team led by Andrea King, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, analyzed the subjective response of 104 young adult heavy social drinkers to alcohol and tracked their long-term drinking habits. They found that heavy social drinkers who report greater stimulation and reward from alcohol are more likely to develop alcohol use disorder over time, which they report May 15 in the journal Biological Psychiatry. Their findings run counter to existing hypotheses that innate tolerance to alcohol drives alcoholism. A group of light social drinkers was used as a control. Participants engaged in three sessions, in which they were given a placebo drink with only the smell of alcohol, a low dose of alcohol or a high dose. The initial assessment when the participants were in their 20s revealed that the heavy drinkers showed a strongly positive preference to alcohol, reporting greater stimulating effects, ‘liking’, and ‘wanting more’, with lower sedative and cortisol effects. Participants were then assessed in regular follow-ups to track their drinking behaviors and symptoms of addiction over time. (Light drinkers formed one low-risk drinking group over time with no addiction symptoms so they were not further examined.) Searching for how those initially measured alcohol responses might predict which group the participants fell into, King and her team found that those in the high alcohol addiction symptom group reported far higher stimulation and pleasure from alcohol effects than members of the low or intermediate groups. Tolerance to alcohol’s fatiguing effects was less predictive of the future course of addiction. King and her colleagues are now engaged in pilot work to see if early intervention in drinkers with a positive response to alcohol is effective. Alcohol can be a depressant which slows down some regions of the brain, like the prefrontal and temporal cortex, negatively affecting rationality and memory. The connection between the amount of alcohol intake, level of depressed mood, and how it affects the risks of experiencing consequences from alcoholism, were studied in a research done on college students. Studies on adolescent sensitivity to alcohol showed that there were few gross behavioral changes between children (10–15) after they were given a dose of alcohol that would cause intoxication in adults. The study, carried out at the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport in Oscoda, Michigan, used two drivers in real cars and measured reaction times to the onset of light on the windshield. The study showed that at 35 mph, reading a text message increased the reaction time the most, 0.12 \n\nA randomized trial of low-dose gabapentin for post hospitalization relapse prevention in a Thai clinical sample of alcohol dependence.

The type I error rate, denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha), is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected given that it is true.This may also be referred to as a false positive.A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected but is actually true in the population.Two types of error are possible (Table 51-3).Type I Error.The aim was to show similar oncologic endpoints with improved secondary outcomes (improved cosmesis, decreased postoperative pain, decreased hernia incidence).26 The prevalence of these trials have increased substantially from under 100 in 2005 to nearly 600 in 2015.27 The most important consideration when evaluating this type of trial is the prespecified margin of noninferiority, a value that is largely arbitrary in the literature.28USE AND MISUSE OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCEThe use of statistical methods is central to the scientific process; it is only through statistics that the problem of induction29 can be addressed. While this chapter is not intended to be 6a comprehensive description of statistical methods, understand-ing the appropriate application of statistical tools is critical to being able to assess the conclusions presented in the literature, and therefore we present a summary of those statistical terms that are most germane to being able to interpret a clinical study.Type I and Type II ErrorsBy necessity, statistical testing requires declaration of a null hypothesis, usually corresponding to the “default” state (i.e., no difference or the patient is healthy). The alternative hypothesis would then negate the stated null hypothesis (i.e., there is a dif-ference or the patient is unhealthy). A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected but is actually true in the population. The type I error rate, denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha), is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected given that it is true.A type II error is the failure to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.This error may also be referred to as a false negative.The type II error rate is denoted by the Greek letter β (beta), and is related to the power of a study.Power can range from 0 to 1, and as power increases, there is decreasing probability of making a type II error. If the tests are statistically independent from each \n\n Although there are no formal standards for power (sometimes referred to as ), most researchers assess the power of their tests using  = 0.80 as a standard for adequacy. In medicine, for example, tests are often designed in such a way that no false negatives (type II errors) will be produced. But this inevitably raises the risk of obtaining a false positive (a type \n\nType-II error, also known as a false negative, occurs when a statistical test incorrectly fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. It is important to understand that Type-II errors and Type-I errors (rejecting a true null hypothesis) are complementary, meaning that reducing one increases the likelihood of the other. A Type-II error occurs when we incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis, despite there being convincing evidence to reject it. Type-II errors can arise due to various factors, including a small sample size, weak statistical power, or a low level of significance set for the test. To minimize the occurrence of Type-II errors, researchers often conduct power calculations before conducting their studies to determine an appropriate sample size that provides sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful effects. By lowering the significance level, the chance of committing a Type-I error decreases but may increase the risk of a Type-II error. Conversely, raising the significance level reduces the likelihood of a Type-II error but increases the risk of a Type-I error. In summary, a Type-II error occurs when a statistical test fails to reject a false null hypothesis. It is important to strike a balance between minimizing both Type-I and Type-II errors by carefully selecting sample sizes, conducting power calculations, and considering the appropriate significance level for a test.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

It is important to understand that Type-II errors and Type-I errors (rejecting a true null hypothesis) are complementary, meaning that reducing one increases the likelihood of the other. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H0) represents the assumption that there is no significant difference or relationship between variables, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) proposes the existence of a significant difference or relationship. A Type-II error occurs when we incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis, despite there being convincing evidence to reject it. Type-II errors can arise due to various factors, including a small sample size, weak statistical power, or a low level of significance set for the test. To minimize the occurrence of Type-II errors, researchers often conduct power calculations before conducting their studies to determine an appropriate sample size that provides sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful effects.

In calculating the power of a study and its impact on the likelihood of making a type II error, three main factors are considered: the statistical significance criterion, the magnitude of the effect of interest, and the sample size used to detect the effect. The power of a study can range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a greater ability to detect an effect. As the power increases, the probability of making a type II error decreases. A lower significance level means more evidence is required to reject the null hypothesis, which can increase the power of the study and reduce the likelihood of a type II error. In summary, the power of a study is influenced by the statistical significance criterion, the magnitude of the effect, and the sample size. By increasing power through appropriate consideration of these factors, researchers can reduce the likelihood of making a type II error and improve the reliability of their conclusions. Reference:\n- *Type II Error & Power* - Understanding and Using Statistics in the Health Sciences by Marcia M. Boumil, PhD\n\nTo increase the statistical power of a study while keeping the level of significance at 5%, the investigators should focus on decreasing the type II error rate. In a hypothesis test, the level of significance (often set at 5%) represents the threshold at which the null hypothesis is rejected. A lower level of significance would make it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. Conversely, a higher level of significance would make it easier to reject the null hypothesis. To increase the statistical power while maintaining a 5% level of significance, the investigators should focus on decreasing the type II error rate. By reducing the likelihood of committing a type II error, the study becomes more sensitive to detecting true effects. One approach is to increase the sample size. Another option is to reduce variability in the data, possibly through stricter inclusion criteria or improved measurement techniques.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

To calculate the degrees of freedom in a table, we need to consider the constraints or dependencies within the table. In a 4 x 4 table with no constraints, each cell can be filled independently, resulting in a total of 16 degrees of freedom. However, it's worth noting that the concept of degrees of freedom may change depending on the context and constraints of the table. the margins of the table are fixed, i.e. As pointed out by Fisher, this leads under a null hypothesis of independence to a hypergeometric distribution of the numbers in the cells of the table. The approximation is inadequate when sample \n\n columns marginal totals, and represent the grand total by n. So the table now looks like this: Fisher showed that conditional on the margins of the table, a is distributed as an hypergeometric distribution with a+c draws from a population with a+b successes and c+d failures. The probability of obtaining such set of values is given by: . In order to calculate the significance of the observed data, i.e. The usual rule of thumb for deciding whether the chi-squared approximation is good enough is that the chi-squared test is not suitable when the expected values in any of the cells of a contingency table are below 5, or below 10 when there is only one degree of freedom (this rule is now known to be overly conservative ).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

In probability theory, a random variable is defined as a quantity whose values are random and to which a probability distribution is assigned. This formal definition allows us to analyze and describe the behavior of uncertain events in a mathematically rigorous way. By defining and studying the properties of random variables, we can quantify uncertainty and make predictions about the likelihood of certain events occurring. The probabilities associated with each outcome can be described using a probability distribution. In this case, our sample space would be Ω = {H, T} and Y would take on values from this set based on the actual outcome of the coin toss. [Reference: Adapted from \"Probability Theory: A Concise Course\" by Y.A. Considering this assumption, we can consider each document a Bernoulli process. The probability spaces of the product are invariant and the probability of a given sequence is the product of the probabilities at each trial. Consequently, if p=P(t) is the prior probability that the outcome is t and the number of experiments is ld we obtain the probability of Xt=tf is equal to: P(Xt=tf|p)=(ld pick tf)ptfqld-tf Which is the sum of the probability of all possible configurations having tf outcomes out of ld. P(Xt=tf|p) is a probability distribution because Σ(t∈V)P(Xt=tf|p)=(p+q)ld=1\n\n teaching the joint probability of two independent events, teachers often explain the abstract procedure (p1 * p2) first and illustrate this procedure with an example (e.g., throwing a die twice). After the solution attempt, the principle behind the joint probability of two independent events will be explained, using the chosen \n\n Suppose we have a random variable that produces either a success or a failure. We want to compare a model M1 where the probability of success is q = ½, and another model M2 where q is unknown and we take a prior distribution for q that is uniform on [0,1]. That gives a likelihood ratio of 0.1 and points towards M2. The most obvious representation is to take this set as the sample space, the probability measure to be uniform measure, and the function to be the identity function. For a coin toss, a suitable space of possible outcomes is Ω = { H, T } (for heads and tails).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.
