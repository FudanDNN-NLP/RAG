More recently, it has been demonstrated that alternate signal sequences such as UGUA upstream off the cleavage site can also direct cleavage and polyadenylation in the absence of the AAUAAA signal. After the synthesis of the sequence elements, several multi-subunit proteins are transferred to the RNA molecule. For UGUA dependent processing sites, binding of the multi protein complex is done by Cleavage Factor I (CF I).

Electrons are initially donated by molecules such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These molecules pass their electrons to the first complex, complex I, which then transfers them to coenzyme Q (CoQ). This complex transfers the electrons to oxygen (O2), which is the final electron acceptor. Throughout the electron transport chain, the energy released from the electron transfers is used to pump protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient is then utilized by complex V, or ATP synthase, to generate ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. It plays a crucial role in the aerobic respiration process by oxidizing acetyl-CoA molecules derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. During the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA enters the cycle and undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions that result in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. Instead, the high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 are transferred to the electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain consists of a series of protein complexes, including NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP synthase. This proton gradient is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP, which is the main energy currency of the cell. The variations on this theme are due mainly to carotenoids and phycoerythrins that give the cells their red-brownish \n\nThe final process by which electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to produce water is through the electron transport chain, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. As the electrons pass along this chain, they fall to successively lower energy states and release energy. The electrons are ultimately passed to molecules of oxygen gas (O2) that have diffused into the mitochondrion. As the electrons move through the electron transport chain, they release energy that is used to pump H+ ions (protons) across the membrane, from the innermost mitochondrial compartment (the matrix) to the intermembrane space. The most prominent reaction facilitated by this gradient is the generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP. This process generates a gradient of H+ ions, which is used to drive the synthesis of ATP, providing cells with the energy they need to carry out their functions. It is responsible for the final stage of aerobic respiration, where electrons are transferred through a series of carriers to generate ATP, the cell's primary energy source. The ETC starts by removing two electrons and a proton from NADH, which is converted back into NAD+ for further use in cellular respiration. Throughout the ETC, the energy released from the electron transfer is used to pump protons (H+) across the mitochondrial membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient, with a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space compared to the matrix of the mitochondria. The energy stored in this gradient is crucial for ATP synthesis. This process of ATP synthesis driven by the electron transport chain is known as chemiosmosis. This transfer of electrons powers the pumping of protons across the mitochondrial membrane, establishing an electrochemical gradient. Ultimately, this gradient drives ATP synthesis, allowing the cell to store and utilize energy derived from oxidation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school biology.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35% during the Carboniferous period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen and the breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.

It is a process where cells transition from a spread or elongated shape to a spherical morphology during mitosis. This phenomenon has been observed in both artificial cultures in vitro and naturally forming tissue in vivo. Firstly, it is necessary for correct mitotic spindle alignment, ensuring that daughter cells divide parallel to the tissue plane and maintain tissue homeostasis. Maintaining apical cell-cell junctions during mitotic cell rounding is crucial for this alignment. Failure to achieve proper spindle alignment may result in mislocalized daughter cells, leading to apoptotic cell death and disruption of tissue organization. Secondly, mitotic rounding has been proposed to drive morphological events during tissue development. For example, in Drosophila melanogaster, mitotic cell rounding is involved in the epithelial invagination of the tracheal placode. The correct geometry allows for timely and accurate progression through mitosis, ensuring proper cell division. Without adequate space and geometry, the spindle may not function optimally, leading to errors in chromosome segregation and potential genetic instability. Overall, mitotic cell rounding is an integral part of tissue organization and homeostasis. It facilitates correct spindle alignment, drives morphological events, and creates the necessary space and geometry for proper mitotic spindle function. Reference:\n- Mitotic cell rounding is a shape change that occurs in most animal cells that undergo mitosis. Cells abandon the spread or elongated shape characteristic of interphase and contract into a spherical morphology during mitosis. The phenomena is seen both in artificial cultures in vitro and naturally forming tissue in vivo. - Recent studies in the epithelia and epidermis of various organisms show that mitotic cell rounding might serve several important functions. These include correct mitotic spindle alignment, driving morphological events during tissue development, and generating sufficient space and appropriate geometry for proper mitotic spindle function. Mitotic cell rounding is involved in processes such as epithelial invagination and the anisotropic shape and growth of tissue lumens. - Mitotic cell rounding is crucial for maintaining tissue organization and homeostasis by ensuring proper cell division and chromosome segregation. Cell division is essential but must be controlled. State the function of mitosis. List four processes which involve mitosis. State the names of the four phases of mitosis. Draw typical eukaryotic cells as they would appear during the interphase and the four phases of mitosis. Outline four events that occur during prophase. Outline the process of metaphase, inclusive of the role of microtubules and the kinetochore. ​What is (and is not) mitosis? G1 Checkpoint: Determines appropriate growth conditions (nutrients, cell size, presence of growth factors, etc.). Metaphase Checkpoint: Ensures proper spindle assembly and correct attachment to centromeres preventing non-disjunction events. Centrioles begin moving to opposite ends of the cell and fibers extend from the centromeres. Some fibers cross the cell to form the mitotic spindle. In animal cells, cytokinesis results when a fiber ring composed of a protein called actin around the center of the cell contracts pinching the cell into two daughter cells, each with one nucleus. In plant cells, the rigid wall requires that a cell plate be synthesized between the two daughter cells. Describe the structure of a replicated chromosome, include the centromere and sister chromatids. Explain why chromosomes must condense during mitosis. In this unravelled form, the DNA is accessible to transcriptional machinery and so genetic information can be translated DNA is organised as chromatin in all non-dividing cells and throughout the process of interphase. As the DNA is replicated during the S phase of interphase, the chromosome will initially contain two identical DNA strands. These genetically identical strands are called sister chromatids and are held together by a central region called the centromere. When these chromatids separate during mitosis, they become independent chromosomes, each made of a single DNA strand. ​1.6.U.3 Interphase is a very active phase of the cell cycle with many processes occurring in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Oxford Biology Course Companion page 55). List example metabolic reactions occurring during cell interphase. State the difference between mitosis and cytokinesis.. Contrast cytokinesis in plant and animal cells. Describe the formation of the cleavage furrow in animal cell cytokinesis. Oncogenes are mutated forms of proto-oncogenes (which typically control synthesis of proteins involved in cell signaling or cell division). ​The Mitotic index = number of cells containing visible chromosomes (in mitosis) divided by the total number of cells in field of view. ​Hank describes mitosis and cytokinesis - the series of processes our cells go through to divide into two identical copies. He begins by discussing the importance of the cell cycle in development, regeneration, asexual reproduction and wound healing. He then moves through all the phases of mitosis; interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis. Stages of Mitosis, a promotional piece, begins with a fly-through of cells preparing to undergo mitosis (cell division). the cell (telophase). When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the G1 stage of cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome. Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles. At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their \n\nAs discussed in later chapters, a capacity for mitosis within a tissue, either by differentiated cells or by reserve cells, largely determines that tissue's potential to regeneration.Nerve tissue and cardiac muscle are exceptions because their differentiated cells cannot undergo mitosis.Most tissues undergo cell turnover with slow cell division and cell death.The cell is now more spherical and the chromosomes are moved to align at its equatorial plane. The microtubules converge on the centrosomes **(C),** each containing a pair of centrioles. The flattened membrane vesicles near the mitotic spindle may represent fragments of the nuclear envelope, which begin to reassemble during late telophase. _(With permission, from Richard McIntosh, Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder. )_\n\nIn **anaphase** sister chromatids (now called **chromosomes** themselves) separate and move toward opposite spindle poles by a combination of microtubule motor proteins and dynamic changes in the lengths of the microtubules as the spindle poles move farther apart. At **telophase** the following occur:\n\n  The two sets of chromosomes are at the spindle poles and begin reverting to their decondensed state. The spindle depolymerizes and the nuclear envelope begins to reassemble around each set of daughter chromosomes. A belt-like contractile ring of actin filaments associated with myosins develops in the peripheral cytoplasm at the cell's equator. During **cytokinesis** at the end of telophase, constriction of this ring produces a cleavage furrow and progresses until the cytoplasm and its organelles are divided into two daughter cells, each with one nucleus. Most tissues undergo cell turnover with slow cell division and cell death. Nerve tissue and cardiac muscle are exceptions because their differentiated cells cannot undergo mitosis. As discussed in later chapters, a capacity for mitosis within a tissue, either by differentiated cells or by reserve cells, largely determines that tissue's potential to regeneration.Mitotic cells are usually difficult to identify conclusively in sections of adult organs but may often be detected in rapidly growing tissues by their condensed chromatin (Figure 3–16). **FIGURE 3–16 Mitotic cells in adult tissues. Under normal circumstances these elements begin to divide mitotically during the first 24 hours and soon form a layer of new connective tissue, surrounding the foreign body. They undergo a high degree of pathological hypertrophy of protoplasm and nucleus. Instead of mitosis often amitotic constrictions appear in the nucleus. But the facts have proved that the most conspicuous and constant changes concern the fibroblasts. It is believed that the nuclei in mitotic division are especially sensitive (Holthusen) and that the nuclei of exposed cells lose, in the first place, their capacity for normal mitosis; they either do not undergo division at all or they show pathological mitoses (Grasnick, Gaskell, and others). Perhaps the reason that the fibroblasts in the present experiments are so strongly affected by the x-rays is that they are the only cells which are preparing for mitotic division directly after the introduction of the foreign body, whereas the lymphocytes and polyblasts only rarely divide in the field of inflammation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school biology.

They are intimately associated with wound healing and defense against pathogens, but are also often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. These are immune cells that engulf, or 'phagocytose', pathogens or particles. To engulf a particle or pathogen, a phagocyte extends portions of its plasma membrane, wrapping the membrane around the particle until it is enveloped (i.e., the particle is now inside the cell).

Analyses of meteorological variables on wildfire risk have shown that relative humidity or precipitation can be used as good predictors for wildfire forecasting over the past several years. High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called \"snag forest habitat\"), which often has higher species richness and diversity than an unburned old forest.

While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive.

On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress. What also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way.

During a primary adaptive immune response to an antigen, both B and T cells that recognize the antigen undergo proliferation, leading to an increased number of antigen-specific cells. Some of these cells differentiate into memory cells, which persist in the body after the primary response. The generation of memory B and T cells during the primary adaptive immune response allows for a more rapid and effective response to subsequent infections. When an individual is exposed to a pathogen for the first time, the adaptive immune response is initiated and specific immunological memory is established by adaptive immune cells. During this initial response, effector T cells and pathogen-specific antibodies work together to enhance the functions of innate immune cells, effectively targeting the pathogen for elimination. However, even after the infection is cleared, immunological memory continues to provide protection. During this memory phase, if the individual is exposed to the same pathogen again, the immune system can mount a rapid and robust secondary immune response. This is because the immune system \"remembers\" the specific antigens of the pathogen through memory B cells and memory T cells. These antibodies can neutralize the pathogen and prevent it from infecting host cells. Overall, immunological memory plays a crucial role in providing long-lasting protection against reinfection by a specific pathogen. It allows the immune system to respond faster and more effectively, minimizing the severity and duration of the infection. 11.1, which depicts the course of a typical acute infection that is cleared by an adaptive immune response. Reference:\nImmunological memory is discussed in the last part of the chapter. During this period, specific immunological memory is also established by adaptive immune cells. The immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had \n\nThe adaptive immune response plays a crucial role in the clearance of pathogens and prevention of reinfection. After an initial infection, the adaptive immune response kicks in and activates various components to eliminate the pathogen. During the resolution of an infection, the effector lymphocytes that responded to the infection undergo clonal contraction, leading to their death. These memory cells have the ability to rapidly recognize and mount an accelerated response upon future encounters with the same pathogen. The presence of memory cells is critical in preventing reinfection. If the same pathogen enters the body again, memory B cells can quickly differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies that neutralize or eliminate the pathogen. The generation and persistence of memory B and T cells are key features of the adaptive immune response that provide long-term protection against pathogens. During the initial encounter with a pathogen, the immune system identifies and recognizes specific molecules on the surface of the pathogen called antigens. Once the pathogen is cleared, a population of B and T cells called memory cells are generated. These cells \"remember\" the specific antigens of the pathogen and provide long-term immunity. While the number of memory cells may decline over time, the immune system retains the ability to mount a response upon encountering the same pathogen again.

Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium, the gel, where an electric field induces the nucleic acids (which are negatively charged due to their sugar-phosphate backbone) to migrate toward the anode (which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell). Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel. For larger separations between similar sized fragments, either the voltage or run time can be increased. Fragment size is usually reported in \"nucleotides\", \"base pairs\" or \"kb\" (for thousands of base pairs) depending upon whether single- or double-stranded nucleic acid has been separated. Similarly, RNA and single-stranded DNA can be run and visualised by PAGE gels containing denaturing agents such as urea. Factors affecting migration of nucleic acids A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis. Double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of base pairs. This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments and it is not possible to separate them using standard agarose gel electrophoresis. The limit of resolution depends on gel composition and field strength. and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel. Conformation of DNA The conformation of the DNA molecule can significantly affect the movement of the DNA, for example, supercoiled DNA usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions, for example linear DNA may run faster or slower than supercoiled DNA depending on conditions, and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel. Concentration of ethidium bromide Circular DNA are more strongly affected by ethidium bromide concentration than linear DNA if ethidium bromide is present in the gel during electrophoresis. All naturally occurring DNA circles are underwound, but ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence during electrophoresis can affect its movement in gel. Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology. Increasing the agarose concentration of a gel reduces the migration speed and improves separation of smaller DNA molecules, while lowering gel concentration permits large DNA molecules to be separated. High percentage agarose gels should be run with PFGE or FIGE. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. However, in increasing electric field strength, the mobility of high-molecular-weight DNA fragments increases differentially, and the effective range of separation decreases and resolution therefore is lower at high voltage. The mobility of DNA however may change in an unsteady field. In a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency. Mechanism of migration and separation The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis, i.e. Hydrodynamic interaction between different parts of the DNA are cut off by streaming counterions moving in the opposite direction, so no mechanism exists to generate a dependence of velocity on length on a scale larger than screening length of about 10 nm. This makes it different from other processes such as sedimentation or diffusion where long-ranged hydrodynamic interaction are important. Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium, the gel, where an electric field induces the nucleic acids (which are negatively charged due to their sugar-phosphate backbone) to migrate toward the anode (which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell). Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel. For larger separations between similar sized fragments, either the voltage or run time can be increased.

The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size\n\n that show epigeal germination need external nutrients rather quickly in order to develop, so they are more frequent on nutrient-rich soils. After the faster first phase, the plant develops more slowly than plants that show hypogeal germination. It is possible that within the same genus one species shows epigeal germination while another species shows hypogeal germination. Some genera in which this happens are:\n\nLarger DNA fragments are separated more slowly than smaller ones during gel electrophoresis due to the size-dependent movement of molecules in the gel matrix. As a result, they migrate through the gel more slowly. The larger fragments require more time to reorient themselves as they move snakelike through the gel, which contributes to their reduced mobility. This difference in migration rates based on size allows for the separation of DNA fragments of different sizes. The smaller fragments travel a greater distance in a given time, resulting in them being located closer to the top of the gel, while larger fragments remain closer to the bottom. By comparing the positions of the DNA bands on the gel, researchers can determine the relative size of the fragments. In summary, the separation of larger DNA fragments more slowly than smaller ones during gel electrophoresis is a result of the size-dependent migration of molecules through the gel matrix. Nucleic acid electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate DNA or RNA fragments by size and reactivity.

The Beagle carried twenty-two chronometers, an unusually large number, but necessary to ensure accuracy of the survey. The book was published in 1846, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. HMS Beagle arrived in South America to map out the coastlines and islands of the region for the British Navy. It is the third book in a series of geology books written by Darwin, which also includes The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, published in 1842, and Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. The book was published in 1844, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. It is the second book in a series of geology books written by Darwin that also includes The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs (published in 1842) and Geological Observations on South America (published in 1846). The text contains seven chapters, and includes observations made during Darwin's travels to the volcanic island of St. Jago \n\n Charles Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution, made many significant contributions to the early study of marine biology. He spent much of his time from 1831 to 1836 on the voyage of HMS Beagle collecting and studying specimens from a variety of marine organisms. He then came up with the idea that wherever coral atolls would be found, the central island where the coral had started to grow would be gradually subsiding\n\n The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to. A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands. This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes island species more vulnerable to extinction.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school biology.

Both tissue types consist of specialized cells and extracellular matrix. The cells in the epithelial tissue are organized into one or more cell layers. But, connective tissue is composed of more extracellular fluid and cells in the tissue are scattered throughout this matrix. The main difference between epithelial and connective tissue is that epithelial tissue lines the cavity and the surfaces of organs and blood vessels throughout the animal body whereas connective tissue supports, connects and separates different types of tissues and organs in the body. The free surface of the epithelium is exposed to air or fluids while the bottom is attached to the basement membrane. The connective tissue connects and supports other organs and tissues by filling space between them. The cells and extracellular matrix make up the connective tissue. The composition of the extracellular matrix determines the properties of the connective tissue. A section of the epididymis is shown in figure 2. The connective tissue is shown in blue. The supported epithelium by the connective tissue is shown in purple color. Connective tissue is divided into connective tissue proper and specialized connective tissue. Connective tissue proper is subdivided into loose, irregular connective tissue and dense irregular connective tissue. Loose, irregular connective tissue consists of loosely arranged fibers with many cells. Lymph gland is an example of loose irregular connective tissue, composing of plasma cells, finer elastin fibers, and thicker collagen fibers. Dense irregular connective tissue contains a dense woven network of collagenous fibers in a viscous matrix. Dermis, muscle fascia, and joint capsules contain dense irregular connective tissue. Cartilage, adipose tissue, hematopoietic tissue (bone marrow and lymphoid tissue), blood, and bone are specialized connective tissue. The dense irregular connective tissue in the skin is shown in figure 3. Connective Tissue: Connective tissue cells are scattered throughout an extracellular matrix. Connective Tissue: Cells in the connective tissue are spread throughout the tissue. Connective Tissue: Connective tissue is developed from mesoderm. Connective Tissue: Connective tissue supports and connects organs and tissues. Connective Tissue: Connective tissue is found in adipose, bone, ligaments, tendons, nerves, cartilage and muscles. Epithelial tissue and connective tissue are two basic types of tissues found in animals. Both tissues conjugate with each other during functioning in the body. Thus, the main difference between epithelial and connective tissue is their function in the body. “Why Epithelial Tissue Is Important.” ThoughtCo. <https://www.thoughtco.com/animal-anatomy-epithelial-tissue-373206>. “Connective Tissue.” The Leeds Histology Guide. <http://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/tissue_types/connective/connective_tissue_types.php>. “Blood and Other Types of Connective Tissue.” ThoughtCo. <https://www.thoughtco.com/connective-tissue-anatomy-373207>. The cells that produce and maintain the fibers are packed and aligned between fiber bundles.However, in dense regular connective tissue, the fibers are arranged in parallel array and are densely packed to provide maximum strength.As in dense irregular connective tissue, the fibers of dense regular connective tissue are the prominent feature, and there is little ECM.In areas of the body where foreign substances are continually present, large populations of immune cells are maintained. For example, the lamina propria, the loose connective tissue of mucous membranes, such as those of the respiratory and alimentary systems, contains large numbers of these cells. Dense irregular connective tissue is characterized by abundant fibers and few cells. Dense irregular connective tissue contains mostly collagen fibers. Cells are sparse and are typically of a single type, the fibroblast. Because of its high pro portion of collagen fibers, dense irregular connective tissue provides significant strength. Typically, the fibers are arranged in bundles oriented in various directions (thus, the term irregular) that can withstand stresses on organs or structures. Hollow organs (e.g., the intestinal tract) possess a distinct layer of dense irregular connective tissue called the submucosa in which the fiber bundles course in varying planes. This arrangement allows the organ to resist excessive stretching and distension. Similarly, skin contains a relatively thick layer of dense irregular connective tissue called the reticular layer (or deep layer) of the dermis. Dense regular connective tissue is characterized by ordered and densely packed arrays of fibers and cells. Dense regular connective tissue is the main functional component of tendons, ligaments, and aponeuroses. As in dense irregular connective tissue, the fibers of dense regular connective tissue are the prominent feature, and there is little ECM. However, in dense regular connective tissue, the fibers are arranged in parallel array and are densely packed to provide maximum strength. The cells that produce and maintain the fibers are packed and aligned between fiber bundles.They consist of parallel bundles of collagen fibers.Situated between these bundles are rows of fibroblasts called tendinocytes (Fig.6.4 and Plate 5, page 194).Tendinocytes are surrounded by a specialized ECM that separates them from the load-bearing collagen fibrils.In H&E–stained cross sections of tendon, the tendinocytes appear stellate. There are three types of cartilage:\n\n• Hyaline cartilage has a translucent, bluish-white appearance.2.10 The structure of hyaline cartilage.Fig.Cartilage has no blood supply and its nutrition is supplied by the fibrous sheath or perichondrium that surrounds it.It is composed of cells (known as chondrocytes) and fibres within a gel-like ground substance.2.10).2.8 Light micrograph of adipose tissue. ### Dense connective tissue\n\nDense or fibrous connective tissue consists of densely packed collagen fibre bundles with relatively few fibroblasts and other cells in between them (Fig. • Parallel arrangement is known as regular fibrous connective tissue: tendons, which are strong bands of fibrous tissue linking muscles to bone, and ligaments, which link bone to bone. • Irregularly interwoven fibres are seen in the dermis of the skin and in the capsules of joints, as well as in organs such as the testes and lymph nodes. Irregular dense connective tissue is often found in sheets and forms the basis of most fascias and aponeuroses. ### Cartilage\n\nCartilage is a specialised connective tissue which is rigid but flexible and resilient and is able to bear weight (Fig. It is composed of cells (known as chondrocytes) and fibres within a gel-like ground substance. Cartilage has no blood supply and its nutrition is supplied by the fibrous sheath or perichondrium that surrounds it. The main components of connective tissue, whether it is connective tissue proper or special connective tissue, include fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance, and cells. These components provide structural support and various functions within the body. Connective tissue proper, which includes loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue, differs in the ratio of ground substance to fibrous tissue. Loose connective tissue has a higher proportion of ground substance and a lower amount of fibrous tissue, while dense connective tissue has a higher amount of fibrous tissue and less ground substance. Dense regular connective tissue, a type of dense connective tissue, is characterized by collagen fibers arranged in an orderly parallel fashion, providing tensile strength in one direction. This tissue is found in structures such as tendons and ligaments. On the other hand, dense irregular connective tissue, another type of dense connective tissue, has dense bundles of fibers arranged in all directions, providing strength in multiple directions. Special connective tissue includes reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood. Reticular connective tissue is characterized by a network of reticular fibers, which forms the framework of organs like the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in structures like the ear, nose, and joints. Bone is a mineralized connective tissue that provides support, protection, and assistance in movement. Blood, though some authorities do not include it as connective tissue, is also considered a special connective tissue due to its role in transportation, immunity, and clotting. In summary, both connective tissue proper and special connective tissue share common components such as fibers, ground substance, and cells. Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. All connective tissue consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue because they lack the fiber component. The term \"connective tissue\" (in German, Bindegewebe) was introduced in 1830 by Johannes Peter Müller. The tissue was already recognized as a distinct class in the 18th century. Connective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue. Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.) Loose and dense connective tissue are distinguished by the ratio of ground substance to fibrous tissue. Loose connective tissue has much more ground substance and a relative lack of fibrous tissue, while the reverse is true of dense connective tissue. Dense regular connective tissue, found in structures such as tendons and ligaments, is characterized by collagen fibers arranged in an orderly parallel fashion, giving it tensile strength in one direction. Dense irregular connective tissue provides strength in multiple directions by its dense bundles of fibers arranged in all directions. Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood. Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues. New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. Type I collagen is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body. Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the body water and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT. Connective tissues are derived from the mesenchyme. Collagenous fibers Bind bones and other tissues to each other Alpha polypeptide chains tendon, ligament, skin, cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, gut, and intervertebral disc. Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue. Myxomatous degeneration – a pathological weakening of connective tissue. Mixed connective tissue disease – a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease. ^ \"Connective Tissue Study Guide\".

In the first stage of photosynthesis, called the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons (H+), and electrons. The NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions is used in the second stage of photosynthesis, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic molecules, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The ATP and NADPH produced in the thylakoid membranes are utilized in the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide into organic molecules, which are essential for plant growth and metabolism. The photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two half-reactions of oxidation and reduction, both of which are essential to producing fuel. In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons. The second phase of plant photosynthesis (also known as the Calvin-Benson cycle) is a light-independent reaction that converts carbon dioxide into glucose (fuel). These catalysts must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident \n\n uses the energy from short-lived electronically excited carriers to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds that can be used by the organism (and by animals that feed on it). The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to most enzymes used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway, but the enzymes in the Calvin cycle are found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the cell cytosol, separating the reactions. They \n\n activated in the light (which is why the name \"dark reaction\" is misleading), and also by products of the light-dependent reaction. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as, this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or \"triose phosphates\", namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). The large amounts of ATP and NADPH required for carbon fixation in the chloroplast are generated through the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membranes, initiating a series of reactions. In the first stage, known as the light-dependent reactions, light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. This is achieved through a series of electron transport chains and the splitting of water molecules, which releases electrons and produces oxygen as a byproduct. The generated ATP and NADPH are then used in the second stage, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic carbon molecules through a series of enzymatic reactions. For every 3 molecules of carbon dioxide that enter the Calvin cycle, 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is produced.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school biology.

This means that in eukaryotic cells, the DNA is enclosed within a nuclear envelope, which separates it from the rest of the cell's cytoplasm. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells have their DNA located in an area called the nucleoid, which is not separated from other parts of the cell by a membrane. In addition to the presence of a nucleus, eukaryotic cells are generally larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells contain many specialized organelles that perform specific functions. The ER comes in two types: rough ER, which contains ribosomes, and smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes. Eukaryotic cells also have a Golgi apparatus, which is responsible for manufacturing and shipping out materials such as proteins. Furthermore, eukaryotic cells have mitochondria, which are involved in metabolic processes such as cellular respiration. Another distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of a cytoskeleton, which is made up of fibers that provide structural support and facilitate cell movement. Overall, the key differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells lie in the presence of a nucleus, the complexity and number of organelles, and the overall size and structural organization of the cell. - General characteristics\n- There are two types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. - Prokaryotes were the first of the two to develop and do not have a self-contained nucleus. Their mechanisms are simpler than later-evolved eukaryotes, which contain a nucleus that envelops the cell's DNA and some organelles. - Prokaryotes\n- Prokaryotes have DNA located in an area called the nucleoid, which is not separated from other parts of the cell by a membrane. There are two domains of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes have fewer organelles than eukaryotes. Both have plasma membranes and ribosomes (structures that synthesize proteins and float free in cytoplasm). Two unique characteristics of prokaryotes are fimbriae (finger-like projections on the surface of a cell) and flagella (threadlike structures that aid movement). - Eukaryotes\n- Eukaryotes have a nucleus where DNA is contained. They are usually larger than prokaryotes and contain many more organelles. The nucleus, the feature of a eukaryote that distinguishes it from a prokaryote, contains a nuclear envelope, nucleolus and chromatin. There are two types, rough ER (containing ribosomes) and smooth ER (lacking ribosomes). Prokaryotic cells have specific characteristics that distinguish them from eukaryotic cells. Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotic cells do not have a self-contained nucleus. There are two main domains of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes have fewer organelles compared to eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells also have some unique characteristics. They possess fimbriae, which are finger-like projections on the cell surface, and flagella, which are threadlike structures that aid in movement. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have a nucleus that contains the DNA. They are typically larger than prokaryotic cells and contain numerous organelles. The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is surrounded by a nuclear envelope, and it also contains a nucleolus and chromatin. In eukaryotic cells, metabolic processes like cellular respiration occur in the mitochondria. Overall, these are the general characteristics that set prokaryotic cells apart from eukaryotic cells. They lack a nucleus, have DNA located in the nucleoid, possess fewer organelles, and have unique features such as fimbriae and flagella. Smaller molecules are able to pass freely through the nuclear pore to get into and out of the nucleoplasm, while larger proteins need the help of receptors on the surface of the nuclear envelope. gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers).
