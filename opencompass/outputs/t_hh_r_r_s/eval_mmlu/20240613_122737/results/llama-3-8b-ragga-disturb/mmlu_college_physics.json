X-ray photons) over a period of time. Moreover, from these series of (in many cases underexposed) images, the number of detected photons can be determined for each pixel. Observed photon counts fluctuate due to different noise sources and motion within the sample. More elaborate calculations can correct for various types of noise of known spectra, such as detector noise or photon shot noise. Theoretical background Projectional imaging Although kinetic imaging has been used only with X-rays thus far, in theory, the kinetic method can be applied to any imaging technique that uses penetrating radiation, such as X-ray radiography or transmission electron microscopy. Traditionally, these parameters are binned into a single image from which the attenuation values can be calculated. Intensity fluctuations and noise Because of the photon nature of X-rays, intensity measurements inevitably contain shot noise, which follows a Poisson distribution. Other types of noise, like detector noise or electrical noise can also contribute to fluctuations of the measured X-ray signal but do not provide information about the studied sample. In comparison, X-ray intensity changes arising from the alteration of attenuation carry important motion information. In the above formula, μ is the attenuation coefficient and x is the distance that the radiation travelled in the absorber. The result of the intensity measurement can be, for example, an X-ray photon number reading, k. The measurement only approximates expected values The expected value (E(k), E = expected) and the variance (Var(k)) are parameters used to describe the theoretical distribution of the detected photon numbers. Distribution of photon count probability To calculate the attenuation values (E(D), Var(D), Err(E(D)) and Err(Var(D)) from the estimated photon counts (E(k),Var(k)), the distribution of the intensity probabilities should be estimated: If the distribution of attenuation can be estimated by a Gaussian distribution, the signal intensities (k, photon counts) follow a log-normal distribution. It is also assumed that the photon count values (k) are subject to Poisson distributed shot noise. However, if instrument noise contributes significantly to the measured fluctuations, the distribution of this noise must be determined and taken into account at this step. The distribution of photon count probabilities can be used to estimate the expected value (E(D)) and the variance (Var(D)) of the attenuation: The error of E(D) is the standard error of experimentally calculated E(D) values and the error of Var(D) is the standard error of experimentally calculated Var(D) values. The reason is that the E(D) values are calculated by averaging the series of attenuation values computed from the corresponding series of photon numbers (from the underexposed images) and converted into a logarithm. On the other hand, the attenuation values of common radiographs are calculated from a single summed up photon number converted into a logarithm. The SNR can be increased initially by enhancing the \"signal\" or \"contrast\", which is the intensity difference between the object of interest and the background. In many cases, the kinetic image will have a higher SNR (better image quality) compared to traditional images for moving objects. (2018)\n\nThe advantages of using GaAsP hybrid detectors in fluorescence lifetime microscopy, compared to photon counting detectors currently in use, are as follows:\n\n1. Improved quantum efficiency: GaAsP hybrid detectors have a detection quantum efficiency that reaches or even surpasses the efficiency of fast single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). This means that they are able to detect a higher percentage of photons, resulting in a better signal-to-noise ratio and more accurate measurement of lifetimes. Larger active area: GaAsP hybrid detectors have an active area that is on the order of 5 mm², compared to the significantly smaller active area of about 2.5 × 10⁻³ mm² for a SPAD. The larger active area allows for the detection of more photons, thereby increasing the overall sensitivity of the detector. Clean temporal response: GaAsP hybrid detectors have a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) response that is clean, without the presence of \"bumps\" and diffusion tails that are typical in conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and SPADs. This clean temporal response ensures accurate timing and minimizes timing inaccuracy in fluorescence lifetime measurements. Absence of afterpulsing: One of the significant advantages of GaAsP hybrid detectors is that they are intrinsically free of afterpulsing. The absence of afterpulsing in GaAsP hybrid detectors ensures that the FLIM results are free from signal-dependent background and FCS (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) curves are free from the known afterpulsing peak. Overall, GaAsP hybrid detectors offer improved quantum efficiency, larger active areas, a clean temporal response, and the absence of afterpulsing, making them advantageous for fluorescence lifetime microscopy applications when compared to the photon counting detectors currently in use. The variance of the photon number distribution is \n\nThe radiance of an image can be used to characterize the noise in the image in a photon-limited imaging system through the principle of conservation of radiance. In a photon-limited imaging system, the noise is described as a Poisson random process in spatial, angular, and wavelength variables. The mean of this random process is the spectral radiance. By understanding the radiance of the image, we can fully characterize the noise present in the image. Understanding these laws helps in comprehending the relationship between radiance and the statistical properties of the detector output in imaging detectors. In a photon-limited imaging system, where the number of photons is limited, the Poisson random process represents the statistical fluctuations in the number of photons detected. The variations in detected photons contribute to the noise in the image. By characterizing the radiance and its statistical properties, we can understand and quantify the noise present in the image. It's important to note that the characterization of noise in a photon-limited imaging system is conditional on viewing a specified object. The noise and its relation to radiance can be further analyzed using task-based measures of image quality and the information content of a single detected photon. Therefore, the radiance of an image provides crucial information for understanding and characterizing the noise in a photon-limited imaging system, allowing for comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the image quality. The technology allows the visualization of motion; it is based on an altered data acquisition and image processing algorithm combined with imaging techniques that use penetrating radiation (e.g., X-rays).

Unfortunately, these methods are often time consuming and require bulky equipment which must be consistently cleaned and maintained to produce reliable results. Still another procedure is described by T. W. Tallqvist in Z. Klin. Attempts to quantify the Tallqvist procedure instrumentally by applying light absorption techniques or more recently light reflectance measurements have not been successful due to relatively large margins of error encountered in light absorbance or reflectance measurements. 3,764,480, provide means for detecting surface bacteria by reflectance measurements. While it is known that the light reflectivity of a surface, i.e., the ratio of the light emission reflected from a surface to the whole incident light emission thereon, is related to the physical property and the light absorptive and scattering properties of the surface media and to the refractive indices of the media through which the light must pass, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reflectivity is a complex phenomenon which is further complicated by the addition of a light absorbing substance, such as blood containing highly colored hemoglobin. The use of a matrix having an index of refraction close to or equal to that of a blood sample does not substantially improve the precision of light reflectance measurements. Such matrices may contain such materials as the white or light colored metals, metallic carbonates, oxides and sulfides which are insoluble in and unreactive with water or blood. In one preferred mode of the present invention, the matrix is prepared by incorporating an opaque, light reflecting substance on or within a blood absorbent member by various well-known methods which include impregnating an absorbent material with a solvent mixture, suspension or emulsion of the light reflecting substance. Thereafter, the impregnated matrix is dried, thus incorporating on or within the matrix a finely divided, intimate, uniform mixture of the light reflecting substance. Suitable, light reflecting substances which may be used in this invention are substantially opaque and have an index of refraction significantly different from blood. Such materials include the white or light colored powdered metals, metallic carbonates, oxides and sulfides which are insoluble in and unreactive with water or blood serum. Specific examples of such materials and their mean refractive indices, at sodium D-line (589 nm) unless otherwise stated, are aluminum metal powder (0.78 at 434 nm), silver metal powder (0.18), lead carbonate (1.99), lead oxide (2.61), titanium dioxide (2.64), zinc oxide (2.02), zinc sulfide (2.37), zirconium oxide (2.17) and the like. Preferably, the light reflecting substance is incorporated on or within the absorbent member at a concentration which provides a light reflectance of between 30 and 70% of the incident light when the impregnated matrix is saturated with a blood sample, as the optimum precision in reflectance measurement occurs in this range. Thus, it may be useful in some instances to incorporate a thickening agent to bind the light reflecting substance to the absorbent member. Preferably, anionic detergents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate or any long chained organic sulfate or sulfonate, such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate or sodium dodecyl benzene\n\nHumans have poor vision underwater due to the difference in refractive indices between air and water. The refractive index of air is 1.00, while the refractive index of water is approximately 1.33. When light passes from air into water, it undergoes refraction, causing the light rays to bend. This bending of light leads to a distortion of the image that reaches the human eye underwater, resulting in poor vision. To improve resolution underwater, oil immersion lenses are used. Oil has a refractive index of approximately 1.51, closer to that of glass (1.51) used in lenses. By using an oil immersion lens underwater, the refractive index of the lens material aligns more closely with that of water, reducing the refractive mismatch and minimizing the distortion of light rays. This alignment allows for sharper focusing of light, thereby improving resolution and clarity of the underwater image. This medium, typically an immersion oil with a refractive index close to that of glass, eliminates the refractive barrier between the lens and the water. As a result, there is less bending and scattering of light as it passes from water to the oil to the lens, leading to enhanced resolution. By utilizing oil immersion lenses, researchers can capture higher quality images underwater and overcome the limitations imposed by the difference in refractive indices. Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations. At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such \n\nAchieving a high numerical aperture (NA) in microscopy is influenced by several factors. To achieve an NA greater than 1, an immersion medium with a refractive index higher than 1, such as immersion oil, water, or glycerol, is necessary. Another factor to consider is the thickness of the material being observed. The wavelength of light used in microscopy also plays a role in achieving high NA and optical resolution. For visible light microscopes (with a minimum wavelength of around 400 nm), objects smaller than about 200 nm will not be visible. In lipemia, chylomicrons and VLDL are suspended particles that scatter light, producing cloudiness or turbidity similar to that seen in milk. To understand this discrepancy and appreciate its potential occurrence with all light-based methodologies in the clinical laboratory, one must review the features of light scattering pertinent to clinical laboratory instrumentation and the physical chemical differences between naturally lipemic and IntraLipid-supplemented samples. When electromagnetic radiation in the form of light interacts with matter, such as lipid particles, a dipole moment is induced in the particles (4). The particles do not need to reflect the light; instead, the phenomenon arises from the difference in the refractive index between the particles (solute) and the solvent (5). In spectrophotometry, Beer’s law, A = εbc (ε being the molar absorptivity, b the pathlength of the cuvette, and c the concentration), relates the absorbance (A) to the concentration. In turn, absorbance is the negative log measure of the transmittance, or A = log(Io/I), where Io is the intensity of the incident light and I is the intensity of the light as it leaves the cuvette and strikes the detector. From the perspective of the center of the cuvette, the angle toward the direction of the light source is 0 degrees, and the angle toward the direction of the detector is 180 degrees. In absorbance spectrophotometry, one assumes that the decrease in intensity of the light striking the detector is attributable to light being absorbed by the sample. In the presence of light scattering, the light scatters in all directions, but the intensity varies according to the angle θ (the angle between the line of observation and the × axis) and the expression 1 + cos2(θ) gives the relative intensity (4). By analogy with absorption spectroscopy, turbidity is defined as ln(Io/I) (4). As long as the intensity of light scattering remains relatively low, the turbidity relates to the concentration of particles in a linear fashion and can be used analytically in instruments that measure absorbance. Light scattering interferes with absorbance spectrophotometric methods by diminishing the light intensity in the mechanism described above (1). If one changes the physical chemical properties of the particles in solution, such as adding a reagent that improves or decreases the solubility of the particles in the solvent, such as the effect of a surfactant on lipid particles, then the refractive index and the refractive increment change. The wavelength of the light and the molecular weight of the particle remain as important variables in explaining the observed differences between IntraLipid and lipemic samples observed by Bornhorst et al. Rayleigh scattering, as described above, applies for particles smaller than the wavelength of the incident light (6). The intensity of the scattered light relative to the incident light intensity follows λ−4; thus, the solution of particles will scatter light with an intensity more than ninefold greater for violet (400 nm) than for red (700 nm) light (5). Thus, as particles increase in size, their ability to scatter light greatly increases as well. Furthermore, particles whose diameter nears that of the wavelength of the incident light present a distortion of the Rayleigh scattering (6). The distortion becomes noticeable when the particle (for a spheroid) diameter exceeds one fourth of the wavelength (6), which for visible light (400 nm) starts at 100 nm. Furthermore, as the diameter of the particle approaches the wavelength, Rayleigh light scattering loses importance and Mie scattering predominates (7). Heterogeneous mixtures appear white instead of colored because the various particle diameters scatter the light at various angles (5). Both VLDL and chylomicrons effectively scatter light, causing turbidity. VLDL exists in three size classes: small (27–35 nm), intermediate (35–60 nm), and large (60–200 nm) (8). Only the intermediate and large VLDL play a major role in light scattering. Chylomicrons represent a heterogeneous group of particles ranging in size from 70 to 1000 nm and varying greatly in size distribution and number among individuals (9). Because VLDL and chylomicron particles vary greatly in size and triglyceride content, one might expect that a direct measure of triglycerides would not show good correlation with light scattering. The particles range in size from 200 to 600 nm with a mean of ∼345 nm (12). (3) makes the point that one must exercise care in interpreting the results of interference studies that use samples with added IntraLipid (or other synthetic emulsion) to simulate lipemia. Three types of errors may occur: interference occurs for native samples but not for IntraLipid; interference occurs for IntraLipid samples but not for native samples; both types of samples show interferences, but the interferences differ in direction (positive as opposed to negative) or degree.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

If all processes in the system are reversible, the entropy is constant. An increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time. In a fictive reversible process, an infinitesimal increment in the entropy ( dS ) of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat ( δQ ) to a closed system (which allows the entry or exit of energy – but not transfer of matter) divided by the common temperature ( T ) of the system in equilibrium and the surroundings which supply the heat: The second term represents work of internal variables that can be perturbed by external influences, but the system cannot perform any positive work via internal variables. Throughout an entire reversible process, a system in the process is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. Total entropy may be conserved during a reversible process, and the system entropy change (not the system surroundings entropy change) is well-defined as heat over temperature,. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the process is also lost. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state; thus the total entropy change may still be zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. An irreversible process increases the total entropy of system and surroundings.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

Optical microscopy and electron microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams interacting with the specimen, and the collection of the scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Earlier microscopes, single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification, date at least as far back as the wide spread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century but more advanced compound microscopes first appeared in Europe around 1620 The earliest practitioners of microscopy include Galileo Galilei, who found in 1610 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects close up and Cornelis Drebbel, who may have invented the compound microscope around 1620 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek developed a very high magnification simple microscope in the 1670s and is often considered to be the first acknowledged microscopist and microbiologist. Optical microscopy Optical or light microscopy involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected from the sample through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera to focus on the exhibit of interest. Limitations Limitations of standard optical microscopy (bright field microscopy) lie in three areas; The technique can only image dark or strongly refracting objects effectively. There is a diffraction-limited resolution depending on incident wavelength; in visible range, the resolution of optical microscopy is limited to approximately 0.2 micrometres (see: microscope) and the practical magnification limit to ~1500x. The most common way to increase contrast is to stain the structures with selective dyes, but this often involves killing and fixing the sample. Sample illumination is via transmitted white light, i.e. However, the technique suffers from low light intensity in the final image of many biological samples and continues to be affected by low apparent resolution. Rheinberg illumination is a variant of dark field illumination in which transparent, colored filters are inserted just before the condenser so that light rays at high aperture are differently colored than those at low aperture (i.e., the background to the specimen may be blue while the object appears self-luminous red). This is an optical staining technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce a color effect. The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. The spatial difference between the two beams is minimal (less than the maximum resolution of the objective). After passage through the specimen, the beams are reunited by a similar prism in the objective. In a homogeneous specimen, there is no difference between the two beams, and no contrast is being generated. However, near a refractive boundary (say a nucleus within the cytoplasm), the difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary beam will generate\n\n  A dye laser is a laser that uses an organic dye as the lasing medium, usually as a liquid solution. Compared to gases and most solid state lasing media, a dye can usually be used for a much wider range of wavelengths, often spanning 50 to 100 nanometers or more. The wide bandwidth makes them particularly suitable for tunable lasers and pulsed lasers. The dye rhodamine 6G, for example, can be tuned from 635 nm (orangish-red) to 560 nm (greenish-yellow), and produce pulses as short as 16 femtoseconds. Moreover, the dye can be replaced by another type in order to generate an even broader range of wavelengths with the same laser, from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet, although this usually requires replacing other optical components in the laser as well, such as dielectric mirrors or pump lasers. Dye lasers were independently discovered by P. P. Sorokin and F. P. Schäfer (and colleagues) in 1966. Some of the laser dyes are rhodamine (orange, 540–680 nm), fluorescein (green, 530–560 nm), coumarin (blue 490–620 nm), stilbene (violet 410–480 nm), umbelliferone (blue, 450–470 nm), tetracene, malachite green, and others. Rhodamine 6G, for example, has its highest output around 590 nm, and the conversion efficiency lowers as the laser is tuned to either side of this wavelength. A wide variety of solvents \n\nDye-sensitized solar cells makes use of photoexcitation by exploiting it in cheaper inexpensive mass production solar cells. Shorter wavelengths are more efficient for the energy conversion compared to longer wavelengths, since shorter wavelengths carry photons that are more energy rich. Light containing shorter wavelengths therefore cause a longer and less efficient conversion of energy in dye-sensitized solar cells. ; Photochemistry ; Luminescence ; Optically pumped lasers use photoexcitation in a way that the excited atoms in the lasers get an enormous direct-gap gain needed for the lasers. The density that is needed for the population inversion in the compound \n\nA bright and wavelength-tunable deep-UV laser source with high spatial coherence can have several potential applications. One such application is laser lithography, which is used in the fabrication of microelectronic devices, such as integrated circuits. In addition, a wavelength-tunable deep-UV laser source can be useful in photochemical processes and spectroscopy. It can be employed in studying the interactions and dynamics of molecules, as well as in various types of spectroscopic measurements. The ability to tune the wavelength of the laser source allows for selective excitation of different molecular species, enabling more precise investigations. Overall, the unique properties of a bright and wavelength-tunable deep-UV laser source with high spatial coherence make it valuable in applications requiring precise and controlled light sources, such as laser lithography, confocal microscopy, and spectroscopy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

As a result, approximately 100 Doppler-limited rovibronic transitions were detected, leading into fine structure states. These are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light (photons), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically ions or other electrons). Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a bound state. The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the binding energy. Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy. The atom is said to have undergone the process of ionization. If the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will be transferred to an excited state. The first six shells, described by the new quantum numbers, are where for every j there are different states from different values of mj. This is because in the original quantum numbers, when (i.e. aligned oppositely), the interaction energy is negative, and in this case. Furthermore, the strength of the interaction is roughly proportional to ℓ. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state. The electron's energy increases along with n because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on azimuthal quantum number is caused not by the electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons. ground state to first excited state, it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

The open-shell singlet state is slightly more stable than the triplet state, with a small energy difference of just 30 meV. The closed-shell solution is less stable by about 1.55 eV. The formation energy of the defect from pristine diamond is approximately 12 eV. In terms of spectroscopic features, the Raman spectrum of the self-interstitial defect in diamond shows two peaks of low intensity at higher wave-numbers than the pristine diamond peak. s parallel to ℓ. Thus they have a positive spin–orbit interaction energy. Thus they have a negative spin–orbit interaction energy. ; The 2 states with j = 1⁄2 came from ℓ = 0 and thus have zero spin–orbit interaction energy. First we have to describe the system by the quantum numbers j, mj and parity instead of ℓ, ml and ms, as in the hydrogen–like atom. Since every even \n\n The ammonia molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape as predicted by the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. Considering only monometallic complexes, unpaired electrons arise because the complex has an odd number of electrons or because electron pairing is destabilized. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX2[(CH3)2PCH2CH2P(CH3)2]2: when X = Cl, the complex is paramagnetic (high-spin configuration), whereas when X = CH3, it is diamagnetic (low-spin configuration). If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centres, the electrons may couple (antiferromagnetic coupling, resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other (ferromagnetic coupling). When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules. At pressures higher than 110 GPa and temperatures around 2,000 K, nitrogen forms a network solid, bound by covalent bonds in a cubic-gauche structure, abbreviated as cg-N. Each unit cell has edge length 3.805 Å, and contains eight nitrogen atoms. As a network, cg-N consists of fused rings of nitrogen atoms; at each atom, the bond angles are very close to tetrahedral. The position of the lone pairs of electrons is ranged so that their overlap is minimised. The cubic-gauche structure for nitrogen is predicted to have bond lengths of 1.40 Å, bond angles of 114.0° and dihedral angles of −106.8°.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

However, as time progresses, the current through the capacitor decreases while the current through the resistor increases. This changing current pattern causes the rate of voltage change across both the capacitor and resistor to slow down. The resistance determines the flow of current through the circuit, while the capacitance affects the storage and release of electrical charge. Over time, however, the current flow through the capacitor decreases, whereas that through the resistor increases.When a battery is first connected across the two terminals of a parallel RC circuit, all of the current flows through the branch of the circuit with the capacitor, causing the voltage across it to begin changing (recall that for a capacitor, I ˜ dV/dt).One of the signature features of neurons is their ability to change their membrane potential rapidly from rest in response to an appropriate stimulus. When a battery is first connected across the two terminals of a parallel RC circuit, all of the current flows through the branch of the circuit with the capacitor, causing the voltage across it to begin changing (recall that for a capacitor, I ˜ dV/dt). Over time, however, the current flow through the capacitor decreases, whereas that through the resistor increases.This change in voltage has an exponential time course whose specific characteristics depend on the resistance (R) and capacitance (C) of the resistor and capacitor. from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging. This ambiguity in the anode and cathode designation causes confusion in battery engineering, as is necessary to have the anode and cathode associated with unique physical components. The common convention is to name the electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge as the anode or the negative (-) electrode and the electrode that absorbs the electrons as the cathode or the positive (+). Naming the physical electrodes as positive (+) or negative \n\n As another example from physics, consider a parallel-plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the force acting on the plates. The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C(x) and charge Q is  The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now Q is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same \"pull\" between a capacitor's plates. Over time, however, the current flow through the capacitor decreases, whereas that through the resistor increases. As this happens, the rate of voltage change across the capacitor (and resistor) slows, and the voltage approaches a steady-state value.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

But new research being developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which could reduce the size of proton accelerator machines from that of a football field to that of a traditional X-ray machine, could soon make proton therapy more easily accessible to all. Better-known X-ray radiation goes all the way through the body and can cause healthy cell death, which could be potentially catastrophic depending on where the tumor is located, like near the spinal cord, neck, or in McLaughlin’s case, the sacrum. Proton therapy is different because the proton beam can be controlled to go only as deep as the tumor, precisely targeting it without damaging the surrounding healthy cells and, therefore, causing fewer side effects. McLaughlin’s proton treatment didn’t physically hurt her at all; she was treated 10 minutes a day, five days a week for two and a half months without any side effects. Not only did McLaughlin beat cancer, but she avoided surgery and the painful and potentially very serious side effects of traditional X-ray radiation therapy. Proton-beam therapy has been around for decades. In the late 1980s, Loma Linda University Medical Center installed a proton accelerator and became the first hospital in the world to give proton treatment. But even though proton therapy is not new, it’s still not widely known. With only six proton centers in the U.S. and 25 to 30 centers in the world, most doctors don’t readily recommend the treatment. In addition to their size, proton accelerator machines are up to three stories high and can cost $100 million to build. But Lawrence Livermore’s research, spearheaded by radiation therapy company TomoTherapy, could soon change this. For the past five years, scientists have been working on a compact proton-beam machine called a dielectric wall accelerator (DWA), which works similarly to the giant machine in Loma Linda but is a fifth the cost and only the size of a traditional X-ray machine. When he began research, there were only three proton centers in the U.S., and all used one of the two types of proton beams, cyclotron or synchrotron. The cyclotron is the same kind of machine used to treat McLaughlin’s tumor–it was originally developed for physics research to study the nature of matter but was later adapted for medical purposes. As the particles move down the tube, the energy of the protons can be controlled very precisely and in a targeted manner. The DWA will be more precise than the cyclotron and synchrotron because doctors will be able to administer the therapy more dynamically. The entire system will be able to fit in the same size treatment vault as a traditional X-ray room, which means that, in theory, proton therapy can be as widespread as X-rays, available in any hospital and any town. Having smaller machines and less infrastructure means lower costs, all of which contribute to the scientists’ goal of making proton therapy as accessible as X-ray therapy. This means the possibility for compact proton-beam therapy is imminent and hopefully will make it much easier for people like McLaughlin, now 28, to have the same results in finding a cure for cancer. In \n\nLinear particle accelerators, also known as linacs, have a wide range of applications in various fields. One important application is in radiation therapy for cancer treatment. This technology allows for more effective and targeted treatment of cancer. The design of a linac depends on the type of particle being accelerated. Overall, linear particle accelerators have diverse applications ranging from cancer treatment to advancing our understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions in the field of particle physics. - Linacs have many applications: they generate X-rays and high energy electrons for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, serve as particle injectors for higher-energy accelerators, and are used directly to achieve the highest kinetic energy for light particles (electrons and positrons) for particle physics. - The design of a linac depends on the type of particle that is being accelerated: electrons, protons or ions. - Linacs range in size from a cathode ray tube (which is a type of linac) to the linac at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally:\n\n Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. The failure of classical mechanics applied to molecular, atomic, and nuclear systems and smaller induced the need for a new mechanics: quantum mechanics. The mathematical formulation was led by De Broglie, Bohr, Schrödinger, Pauli, and Heisenberg, and others, around the mid-1920s, and at that time was analogous to that of classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation and the Heisenberg picture resemble the classical equations of motion in the limit of large quantum numbers and as the reduced Planck constant ħ , the quantum of action, tends to zero. At this point, special relativity was not fully combined with quantum mechanics, so the Schrödinger and Heisenberg formulations, as originally proposed, could not be used in situations where the particles travel near the speed of light, or when the number of each type of particle changes (this happens in real particle interactions; the numerous forms of particle decays, annihilation, matter creation, pair production, and so on). In particular, massive particles can interfere with themselves and therefore diffract. The wavelength associated with a particle is the de Broglie wavelength  where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle (mass × velocity for slow-moving particles). One year earlier, Louis de Broglie had proposed the de Broglie hypothesis: that all particles behave like waves to some extent, and in 1926 Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop the Schrödinger equation, a mathematical model of\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

Then \n\n separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200 MeV in all; where could that energy come from? Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered the empirical formula for computing the masses of nuclei and worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula E=m\\,c^2, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV. The motion of the lighter body (called the \"particle\" below) can then be determined from the Schwarzschild solution; the motion is a geodesic (\"shortest path between two points\") in the curved space-time. The dimensions of momentum units are. The dimensions of energy units are. Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity, facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c. By dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/c. For example, if the momentum p of an electron is said to be 1 GeV, then the conversion to MKS can be achieved by:\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.
