It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology. Scope Differences between adult and geriatric medicine Geriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. Geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but kidney failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function. Increased complexity The decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Geriatric giants The so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. Practical concerns Functional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate. Frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Subspecialties and related services Some diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including: Medical Geriatric cardiology or cardiogeriatrics Geriatric dentistry Geriatric dermatology Geriatric diagnostic imaging Geriatric emergency medicine Geriatric nephrology Geriatric neurology Geriatric oncology Geriatric physical examination of interest especially to physicians & physician assistants.

Geriatrics: Geriatrics is a medical specialty that focuses on the healthcare needs of older adults. Geriatricians are physicians who have specialized postgraduate education and experience in the medical care of older persons. They are trained to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Geriatric Nursing: Geriatric nursing is a specialization within nursing that focuses on providing comprehensive healthcare to elderly adults. Geriatric Nurse Practitioners (GNPs) are registered nurses who have pursued additional education through a master's degree program in nursing. They are trained to deliver primary healthcare to older adults and often work in various settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers. Geriatric Psychiatry: Geriatric psychiatry involves the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders in older adults. Geriatric psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the mental health care of older adults. They are trained to address conditions such as dementia, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders that commonly affect the elderly population. Geriatric Pharmacy: Geriatric pharmacy focuses on the medication management and optimization for older adults. Pharmacists specializing in geriatrics are trained to understand the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older adults, as well as potential drug interactions and adverse effects that may disproportionately affect this population. Geriatric Rehabilitation: Geriatric rehabilitation aims to improve the physical and functional abilities of older adults who may have experienced age-related decline or have specific conditions such as stroke, arthritis, or hip fracture. This specialty involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and social workers, who work together to develop individualized treatment plans to enhance the quality of life and independence of older adults. These are just a few examples of medical specialties and educational programs that focus on the care of older adults.

The call-out blue boxes indicate factors that might delay the aging process including nutrient response pathways and, possibly, adaptive evolutionary effects.

This theory suggests that evolution is influenced by the allocation of limited resources to various aspects of life, including development, sexual maturation, reproduction, number of offspring, and senescence and death. Another theory is the disposable soma theory of aging, proposed by Kirkwood and Holliday in 1979. This theory combines several ideas and suggests that an organism has finite resources to allocate between reproduction and maintenance of its body (\"soma\"). The theory argues that resources invested in reproduction reduce the resources available for maintaining the body, resulting in senescence and eventual death. The programmed death theory, proposed by Weissman in 1882, suggests that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to free up environmental resources for younger members of the species after reproduction is completed. For example, genes for sex hormones may be necessary for reproduction in early life but contribute to the risk of cancer in old age. Overall, these theories provide insights into the trade-offs and variations in life history traits among different organisms and help us understand the evolutionary processes that shape the development, reproduction, senescence, and death in living beings. The Reproductive-Cell Cycle Theory posits that the hormones that regulate reproduction act in an antagonistic pleiotrophic manner to control aging via cell cycle signaling; promoting growth and development early in life in order to achieve reproduction, but later in life, in a futile attempt to maintain reproduction, become dysregulated and drive senescence. Since the \n\nThe theory of aging and death as programmed phenomena in the context of evolution suggests that aging and death have evolved as a mechanism to remove older members of a species from the population. The concept of programmed death proposes that aging is the result of the nonadaptive consequence of evolutionary \"neglect,\" where evolution has been unable to prevent the random degeneration associated with aging. On the other hand, there are living organisms that experience programmed death immediately after reproduction, such as annual plants and semelparous animals. It is worth noting that some studies in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, have shown that restricting reproduction to later life can lead to increased longevity, suggesting that natural selection can operate on later life traits. - [Reference text has been abridged and paraphrased for conciseness]\n\nThis theory states that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to remove older animals from the population so that environmental resources such as food and water are freed up for younger members of the species.The first evolutionary theory of aging was proposed by Weissman in 1882.Programmed death.Aging is seen as the random degeneration resulting from the inability of evolution to prevent it, i.e., the nonadaptive consequence of evolutionary “neglect.” This conclusion is supported by studies that restricted reproduction to later life in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, thus permitting natural selection to operate on later life traits and leading to an increase in longevity. Conversely, there are some living things that undergo programmed death immediately after reproduction, such as annual plants and semelparous animals (Fig. Some of the major classical evolutionary theories of aging include the following:\n\nNegligible senescence Rapid death postreproduction (semelparous animals, annual plants) Rougheye rockfish Bristlecone pine Pacific salmon Sunflower\n\nFIGURE 94e-4 The typical features of aging (aging phenotype and exponential increase in risk of death) are not universal findings in liv-ing things. This theory states that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to remove older animals from the population so that environmental resources such as food and water are freed up for younger members of the species.This theory was proposed by Medawar in 1952.Natural selection is most powerful for those traits that influence reproduction in early life, and therefore, the ability of evolution to shape our biology declines with age.Germline mutations that are deleterious in later life can accumulate simply because natural selection cannot act to prevent them.Antagonistic pleiotropy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

Arlene and I had a nice job of being able to provide some overall vision and making sure that the papers that were selected in the end met the original call and some of the things we had brainstormed. Obviously, having people from the same institution, I don’t want people to get the impression that I was the one who made the decisions on Corey and Adam’s paper because I wasn’t. The awareness of that is at an all-time high. To not be so focused on providing one of these and understanding that there’s a full range of these types of treatments that we’re going to be able to offer. It seems to be better, at least in the early health services studies. Steven, you have a paper in there entitled Advancing Psychologically Informed Practice for Patients with Persistent Musculoskeletal Pain: Promises, Pitfalls, and Solutions. Let’s talk about the promise first because both Corey and Adam talk about the psychosocial aspects in their paper. This idea of psychologically informed practice has interested a lot of people since 2011 and some of it predates 2011. The promise is as good as we have right now, of a model to manage people with chronic pain or pain conditions because it focuses on incorporating the person’s beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors into the care. In a way that’s constructive, useful, and structured and not quite as focused in thinking that all their problems are related to one single physical impairment. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD), there are about 2.5 million older adults struggling with alcohol or drug addiction. Loneliness, untreated mental health problems, and chronic pain also put them at risk for developing substance abuse issues. According to the Center for Applied Research and Solutions (CARS), which published a report on the elderly and potential prescription drug abuse, people ages 65 years old and older make up one-third of the population receiving prescription medications, although this age group represented only 13 percent of the US population in 2008. Older adults are more vulnerable to prescription drug misuse, not specifically abuse; they do not adhere to their doctors’ recommendations for safe consumption, which is risky among a population that must manage multiple prescriptions. NCADD found that people who lost a spouse or long-term partner, who were over the age of 75, were the most likely to struggle with alcohol abuse problems. While older adults are at greater risk from problem drinking and prescription drugs, they are less likely than the general population to abuse other illicit substances; they are less likely to begin abusing heroin instead of prescription opioids, cocaine, or other illegal substances. About 1 percent of the senior citizen population abuses these illicit drugs, according to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). In 2003, according to AARP, about 28 percent of retired adults had ever abused an illicit drug, like marijuana or LSD, but by 2008, that percentage increased to almost 36 percent. Circumstances around retirement, such as having adult children away from home, loss of a spouse or partner, and the death of friends, are unique circumstances among older adults, which can lead to psychological issues that can trigger addiction or substance abuse. they are more likely to need help with daily life from caregivers, which can affect their self-esteem. They may have financial issues due to retirement subsidies, and seeing people close to them pass away are all issues that can cause depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that 1.6 percent of older adults had thoughts of suicide in the past year; about 25 percent of older adults struggle with some form of mental health problem. Ageism is a severe problem that older adults face, not just in general culture, but among doctors and nurses in the medical field. Caregivers, family members, and medical professionals are more likely to have different standards for happiness, wellness, and quality of life for younger adults than older adults. Some people may believe that they should let their elderly friends and family “enjoy” drinking too much or misusing medications because they have a limited time left. This is a false belief, as intoxicating and addictive drugs shorten lifespan for anyone, at any age, and abuse of alcohol and drugs is likely to be a symptom that something is wrong with the person’s mental health, which contributes to a lower quality of life. The problem of ageism also makes it harder to recognize symptoms of mental illness and addiction in older adults. Physical challenges, memory issues, “crabbiness,” and lack of energy are associated with lower general health among older adults, but they are also symptoms of addiction. If an elderly person’s mental and physical health decline rapidly, it could be a sign of substance abuse, or it could be a sign of an underlying chronic condition. This will help to rule out other conditions, like depression, diabetes, or dementia, which could be affecting the senior citizen instead. While it is important to overcome substance abuse and addiction, older adults must still have access to their prescription medications. As substance abuse is better\n\n Psychologists have examined coping skills in the elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an internal locus of control have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Other factors that may link to well-being and quality of life in the elderly include social relationships (possibly relationships with pets as well as humans), and health. Retirement, a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences. Individuals in different wings in the same retirement home have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment, though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health. Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a moderator variable for the relationship between social support and perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly. Aging has a significant impact on society. People of different ages and gender tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, outlooks on life, and self-perceptions. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence. In different societies, age may be viewed or treated differently. For example, age may be measured starting from conception or from birth, and starting at either age zero or age one. Transitions such as reaching puberty, age of majority, or retirement are often socially significant. The concepts of successful aging and healthy aging refer to both social and physical aspects of the aging process. Like many people over age 65, Kathryn has multiple health conditions, each with different concerns and treatments. These conditions, which doctors term comorbidities because they’re “co-illnesses” alongside cancer, present one of the unique challenges in treating older adults with breast cancer. Breast cancer itself is associated with aging: The chances of being diagnosed get higher as you grow older, and more than half of all people who die of breast cancer are over age 65. For doctors, age is an easy piece of information to get. But age alone isn’t enough to tell how well a person may respond to treatment. You can’t always expect the same result based on age. Along with her migraine medicine , she has Type 2 diabetes and effects on her thinking and memory from treatment. At 79, Rita Rattner, of New Rochelle, New York, is 5 years older than Kathryn and has been in treatment for metastatic hormone receptor -positive breast cancer since she was 74. Though she developed arrhythmia, a condition where the heartbeat is not regular, Rita says she has handled treatments well and still walks 3 miles a day. Arti Hurria, MD*, director of the Center for Cancer and Aging at City of Hope National Medical Center in Los Angeles, says the main concern in treating older adults is fitting the cancer treatment to the individual’s overall health and ability to handle side effects. An important tool to help your doctor get a sense of your total health is a geriatric assessment (geriatrics is the study of aging). The assessment looks at many different parts of an older person’s well-being, from health and physical fitness to thinking and memory to social and practical support. The Cancer and Aging Research Group, an organization Dr. Hurria founded, has a simplified geriatric assessment to make it easier for oncologists to get this information. Their version is shorter and you can complete much of it at home then bring the answers to your doctor, saving time during appointments. Though nearly half of breast cancer diagnoses are in people over 65, older adults make up a much smaller share of most clinical trials, the research used to prove a treatment works. Jeanette has other health issues including an eye condition called wet macular degeneration, but those issues haven’t interacted with cancer treatment until recently, when she lost the ability to tell some colors apart. Dr. Freedman says doctors have to make decisions not knowing if the medicine will work as well in an older person, or if the risk of side effects is different. Getting older adults into clinical trials has been a challenge that researchers have known about for years. As with other issues of aging, what seems to be one problem actually covers several areas. One of the biggest problems in getting older adults in clinical trials is comorbidities. Since older adults are more likely to have comorbidities, they are more likely to be excluded from trials. There are other obstacles less visible than exclusion criteria, Dr. Hurria says, like meeting the needs of older adults who may not be able to travel or who must bring a caretaker with their own concerns to appointments. As for older adults, a study in people with breast cancer found they are just as willing to join a clinical trial as younger people, if their doctors give them the opportunity. She spoke to a family member who teaches medicine, and joined up. The catch is that doctors have to offer clinical trials to older people for them to join. Dr. Hurria says that same study found that doctors are less likely to suggest clinical trials to older adults than to other groups. The doctors said they worried about the effects on older adults who have other health conditions and may be frailer. Dr. Hurria says this is a reasonable concern. That often means more side effects, and for older adults, these can be especially hard if they have other conditions and are already taking medicines for them. She says more clinical trials should be designed specifically for older adults and frailer adults to test treatment combinations that have more manageable side effects. Both Dr. Hurria and Dr. Freedman spoke about including your priorities when making decisions. Ask questions and understand why your doctors do or do not recommend a treatment, Dr. Freedman says. You can start a good conversation by doing the patient sections of the geriatric assessment on the Cancer and Aging Research Group website at mycarg.org, Dr. Hurria says. This could start some important discussions and prompt your doctors to complete the rest of the assessment. If you want help, ask someone you trust to work with you. Though Jeanette is happy with her cancer team’s communication, she has also pressed when something was important for her. “I sought them out based on what was most important to me,” Jeanette says. And taking that step has helped her feel good, and stay positive, through treatment.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

The follow-up time for survival of each cohort was 36 months from admission. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (log rank test) and non-parametric correlation analyses (Spearman's rho), variables associated with survival time with a p-value < 0.05 were entered into a multivariate Cox regression model. It is noteworthy that despite financial constraints, the mortality rate did not change over the study period. Health stability was a strong predictor of mortality, in addition to ADL performance. Considering these variables is thus valuable when deciding on the type of service an elderly person needs. Considering the short survival time from admission, it seems relevant that staff is trained in providing palliative care as much as restorative care. Knowledge about predictors of mortality of nursing home residents is sparse, in particular regarding whether the survival time has been shortening in recent decades due to more restrictive admission criteria. Additionally, knowledge about predictors of mortality is needed to provide appropriate care and ensure that the staff are knowledgeable in the areas of care that are most needed. Several factors have been found to predict mortality at admission to a nursing home. Predictors reported by two studies have been related to physical disability [1, 2], problems with eating [2, 3] and use of medication [1, 3]. Other predictors reported have been infection at admittance , pressure ulcer, bowel incontinence , age, male gender, sleep disturbance, where admitted from, and respiratory disease . For instance, predictors of mortality at admission in relation to predictors of mortality among residents living in a nursing home for more than one year seemingly differ . There is no consensus on how to assess for predictors of mortality and therefore comparison may be difficult. Thus, there is not yet a coherent body of knowledge about factors predicting mortality at admission with sufficiently clear implications for planning and nursing care. The current knowledge base has weaknesses both in terms of the low number of studies, the methods used to identify predictors, and whether there have been changes in mortality over time. However, a short survival time underlines the need for knowledge of palliative care in nursing homes . Furthermore, researchers have pointed out several internal factors that are challenging when delivering palliative care in nursing homes. Knowledge of factors influencing mortality, the average length of survival and residents' health status at admission are critical to managers and health officials involved in nursing home care. The aim of this study was to investigate the time from residents' admission to Icelandic nursing homes to death and the predictive power of demographic variables, health status (health stability, pain, depression and cognitive performance) and functional profile (ADL and social engagement) for 3-year mortality in yearly cohorts from 1996-2006. \"* In Sweden, a ten-year study of 150 middle-aged men found that social isolation was one of the best predictors of mortality, both from all causes and from coronary heart disease. * At the Medical College of Wisconsin, Dr. James Goodwin and colleagues found that unmarried persons with cancer had decreased overall survival, even after adjustment for disease severity and type of treatment. In another study, he found that among 256 healthy elderly adults, individuals with good social support systems tended to have lower blood cholesterol levels and higher indices of immune function. These findings were independent of age, smoking, alcohol intake, and degree of emotional stress. * At Stanford University School of Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel conducted research in which patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomly divided into two groups. One group received the usual medical care, while the other received the usual medical care plus weekly ninety-minute group support meetings for one year. Although he planned the study expecting that there would be no difference in life span between the groups, five years later he found that the patients who attended the weekly group support meetings had _twice_ the survival rate of the control group. * A report published in the journal _Science_ reviewed the mounting evidence that social isolation heightens people's susceptibility to illness. \"In fact, when age is adjusted for, social isolation is as great or greater a mortality risk than smoking.After controlling for the effects of physical health, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, race, life satisfaction and health care, the studies found that those with few or weak social ties were twice as likely to die as those with strong ties.\" Psychologists have examined coping skills in the elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an internal locus of control have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Weaning older patients off inappropriate medications that may harm them more than help them should be a priority for all prescribing clinicians, according to two articles published yesterday in the Medical Journal of Australia. resistance of prescribers to discontinue medication, particularly that prescribed by specialists. “More evidence is needed regarding negative, non-reversible effects of ceasing use of certain classes of medication,” Dr Reeve wrote. Both articles concluded that most of the risks of de-prescribing could be minimised with proper planning. Strong lines of communication between doctor and patient, targeting patients at highest risk of ADEs and drugs most likely to be non-beneficial, and consistency of care from one clinician over an extended period of time were also vital to the success of de-prescribing. Social isolation is still one of the major issues associated with a diagnosis of dementia, according to a new report released today by Alzheimer’s Australia. The study followed 50 adults, aged 65-90 years, during two years. The exercises are part of the recently launched Lifestyle-Integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program, which was informed by a world-first study. The LiFE manuals are the result of research by Professor Clemson and colleagues published in the British Medical Journal. They compared those participating in the LIFE program to a control group doing a gentle ’placebo’ exercise program three times a week, and a third group who did traditional balance and strength exercises three times a week. The researchers found a 31 per cent reduction in the rate of falls for participants in the LiFE program compared with the control group. LiFE participants also showed improvements in static and dynamic balance, ankle strength, and in function and participation in daily life, suggesting that the program improves both fall risk and frailty. A new study is investigating the prevalence of, and clinical associations between, analgesic load, pain and daytime sedation in people with and without dementia living in Australian residential aged care facilities. The research by National Seniors Australia, Health conditions and employment among senior Australians, studied 2,000 people aged over 50 year to investigate the role of ill health in inhibiting workforce participation. People with a musculoskeletal injury (61 per cent) and mental illness (58 per cent) were most likely to report that their illness had prevented them from working or looking for work, while arthritis kept people away from work for the longest period of time.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.
