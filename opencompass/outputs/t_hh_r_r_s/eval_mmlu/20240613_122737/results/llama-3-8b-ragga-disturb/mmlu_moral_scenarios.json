It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility.

For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D. Reference:\n- Deontological Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n\n Consequentialists, in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\" Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions. One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce. ; Deontology, which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with one's moral duty.

It is a personal and subjective aspect of medical ethics that helps healthcare professionals navigate difficult, morally challenging situations. According to the African ethic of social cohesion, which emphasizes communal relationships and entering into community with others, the concept of social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic can be viewed in different ways. While some may argue that social distancing could be seen as a violation of this ethic, others argue that it is not inherently wrong and can even be seen as the right way to commune under certain circumstances. In this perspective, social distancing would not be considered wrong if it is necessary to protect others from serious incapacitation or harm. However, it is important to note that there may be cases in which social distancing, while morally permissible and necessary, may still indicate a lack of good character. This suggests that although social distancing aligns with the principles of communal relationship and protection, it may not be seen as a virtuous act in certain situations. Overall, the African ethic of social cohesion does not strictly dictate the view on social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, whether a particular killing was done in self-defense or in order to facilitate a robbery is probably relevant to whether it is wrong. But whether it happens in Greenland or England, or in the morning or at night, is not relevant. For instance, if it was \n\nConsequentialism, which judges actions based on their consequences.

Supporters of duty-based morality believe that feeding the patient is the right and responsibility of the doctor, regardless of the anticipated outcome. For example, a doctor may support a controlled clinical trial, accepting the potential harm to a few individuals in order to derive overall benefits for a larger population. These three perspectives offer different recommendations for treatment in various ethical dilemmas. For example, the duty-based moralist would always feed the patient, while the goal-based or utilitarian doctor would feed the patient when appropriate in their healthcare setting, based on scientific evidence and justifiable outcomes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

In this instance, Josie was administered a narcotic while suffering acute dehydration. This measure should account for the time between a crisis and upgrade along with a statement indicating the cause of the crisis and resultant upgrade. After much demanding by Sorrel, a medication was administered to Josie to counteract the narcotic analgesia she had been administered. Josie was also allowed to drink, which she did fervently. The Institute of Medicine (2001) published six dimensions of health care: safety, effectiveness, patient-centered, timeliness, efficiency, and equality. In Josie’s case, the care was not delivered efficiently, effectively, safely, or in a patient- or family-centered fashion. As Josie exhibited extreme thirst, her symptoms were dismissed, which does not follow patient-centeredness. Moreso, when the nurse administered the narcotic to Josie despite the pleadings of her mother, it demonstrated a lack of family-centered care, safety (in that, the order should have been double checked), efficacy (further demonstrating overuse of narcotic analgesia), and efficiency, as medication orders were either unclearly written or removed. (2001, July). Many people rely on EMS for problems that even they do not view as emergent, and others just plainly abuse the system. My primary motivations are my sense of community, my ability to reduce suffering, and my ability to raise the standard of care within the system. Maslow (1943) includes some of the earliest accepted work on motivational theory, and more contemporary work is based on the acceptance, rejection or modification of his theories, so I will focus on Maslow to begin. My needs, according to Maslow, are not as important to motivation. Maslow discusses how emergency situations can “obscure the ‘higher’ motivations [and create] a lopsided view of human capacities and human nature” (p. 375), and while my career is focused on responding to emergencies, this may hold true for me. While Maslow’s theory is not wholly accepted motivational schema (Robbins & Judge, 2010), EMS managers, and other public safety managers, would do well to understand this exception to motivational theory. There is a deep-seated belief that the workforce is lazy and will do anything possible to undermine the operation. Other theories, such as goal-setting, equity theory, and expectancy theory, as described in Robbins and Judge (2010), are all lacking in one particular constant: there is no constant in human behavior. There are a number of ways that a single motivational factor might influence a particular person on any particular day. For any theory to always be true in every situation, it would cease to be a theory and become a law. It is the manner of this communication that will tend to fail or succeed, based on both the needs of the manager and the needs of the employee at the moment the message is passed. I have always maintained that the best thing that I have ever done for a patient was to hold their hand as they died; however, there are few scenarios that I can posit where I would ever cause the death of another, and I would never do it in my capacity as a medical professional. Saunders and Smith (2010) describe the use of “semantic ploys” (para. 3) in arguing for physician-assisted suicide and how the court deemed the “issue rests with the legislature, not with the court” (para 4). Two states have laws permitting physician-assisted suicide, Oregon and Washington (Death with Dignity Act, 1997; Death with Dignity\n\n The statement \"If a cake contains sugar then it tastes good\" implies under a monotone consequence relation the statement \"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it tastes good.\" Clearly this doesn't match our own understanding of cakes. By asserting \"If a cake contains sugar then it usually tastes good\" a rational consequence relation allows for a more realistic model of the real world, and certainly it does not automatically follow that \"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\" Equally in the absence of a statement such as \n\n for Sam to kill Alice while he was robbing her, and it was wrong because it was done in order to rob her, then if Brenda kills Charles while robbing him is wrong for the same reason. It is impossible for one such killing to be wrong and another right unless they also differ in one or more relevant circumstances. Of course, there could be additional relevant circumstances; if Charles had previously enslaved Brenda for several years, and she finds an opportunity to escape to freedom but needs his car to do so, and knows that he will pursue and \n\n her if he remains alive, then her killing of Charles may be permissible. And there could be yet further circumstances which change the moral quality of this killing. But whatever the total relevant non-moral facts are (i.e., that Brenda killed Charles during a robbery, and she was not previous enslaved, etc. ), then if the principle of moral supervenience is true, then any other killing where those same non-moral facts are true has the same moral properties as Brenda's killing of Charles. For instance, it is not possible for Brenda's killing of Charles to be right, and Sam's killing of \n\n or a bad person.

It was an emergency Caesarean operation. She was doing well until she had an apneic episode, which is a disorder that causes one to stop breathing briefly. Thereby she suffered loss of oxygen to the brain. By the time she left the hospital, she weighed 2.2kg and she was feeding through a feeding bottle. My husband’s aunt saw my daughter and insisted I take her back for a proper medical checkup. Based on her story, I got in touch with her child’s therapist. Then I read another book about a woman who took her son to a school for children with cerebral palsy in Hungary. This programme was for a month, but it was very impactful. What led to your introduction to the physiotherapist whom you said maltreated your daughter? We also knew that going once a year will not help her condition. Coincidentally, I read about a special needs mum who shared her son’s success story in a church’s magazine. I told my daughter’s therapist that someone recommended Bisola to me. She said I should convince my husband to suspend going to Hungary for two years and dedicate that money to paying Bisola. However, she told me the reason she had not referred Bisola to me earlier was because Bisola refused to work with a child with special needs that she had referred to her. She said Bisola didn’t want to work with her because they had earlier had a fallout while working together with a client’s child. By that time, I had worked with several therapists and I knew that when one had more than one therapist working with a child, there was bound to be some form of misunderstanding. I spoke with my speech therapist, who also mentioned she also had a fallout when he and Bisola worked together with a client’s child. She would educate us about feeding, nurturing and overall wellbeing. Were there any time before the CCTV footage discovery in 2016 that you felt something was not right with how she was handling your daughter? Before we made any decision about Nimmy, we would ask for Bisola’s opinion. Early in 2016, I started noticing that my daughter was withdrawn, she stopped smiling. I was told by her caregiver that she was not responding in school and she had stopped attempting to answer questions. We had to read her body language to understand her needs. Bisola used to have therapy sessions with my daughter in her school. In June 2016, Nimmy’s proprietress at Supreme House Montessori School requested that my husband and I come for a meeting in the school. When we got to the school, she told us that Bisola had manhandled our daughter. At the back of my mind, I felt it was all exaggerated, but when I watched the CCTV footage, I was sad; I didn’t know how to express my feelings. We watched an hour session where Bisola tortured our daughter. It was heart-breaking to see my daughter treated by a health worker in such a barbaric act. Her physiotherapist slapped her three times; the third time with her cell phone. She left her head hanging upside for five minutes. She twisted my daughter’s hands several times; at a point she sat on her hands, at another point she tied her hands behind her head. I watched as my daughter fell from her chair while her neck was stuck in between the space at the vertical back rest and the flat wood used for sitting down. I watched on as this lady typed on her phone 90 per cent of the time, only taking some time off to torture my daughter. She took out time to take her selfie, up to five times. What were the thoughts going through your mind after you saw the CCTV footage and what did you do? I have to say this, a special needs mum is a broken woman. There is nothing that tears a woman apart than seeing her child helpless and considered challenged and there is little that she can do. On a daily basis, it takes away one’s energy, self-esteem and, if one is not careful, one’s sanity. I kept asking myself, what if the proprietress was not at her desk and her eyes did not go to the TV at that time? I asked the nanny that follows my daughter to school why Bisola was alone with Nimmy. She said Bisola asked her to step out of the room that my daughter was not cooperating because the nanny was there. My husband and I took Nimmy to see Prof. Afolabi Lesi, a paediatric neurologist at the University of Lagos. He told us he was worried about the number of times she hit her head, but it was too late for an MRI. Bisola was due to travel for her Mandela Washington programme two days later, but I did not know her house address and I knew that because she had a valid US Visa, if I had alerted her at that time, she would run. We kept quiet and allowed her to finish her programme and come back to the country. The truth was we\n\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- When she was 20-years-old, Natalie Pedri of Great Kills was conducting a self assessment she learned in nursing class. \"I was just entering my senior year of nursing school. She was the one who taught me the self assessment skills,\" Pedri added. \"I really couldn't do the clinicals because your immune system is depressed and you can't really be around sick people. And her battle with cancer didn't stop Pedri from obtaining her Bachelor of Science degree in nursing. While she was first inspired to become a nurse while volunteering in Staten Island University Hospital when she was in high school at St. Joseph-By-The-Sea, her diagnoses reaffirmed her career choice. \"I was treated on the pediatric floor. When Pedri was worried about school and losing her hair, Kelley assured her that the university would be there for her and that every hair that fell out meant the chemo was working and was killing the cancer cells. She learned \"what the book doesn't teach\" about how to be with patients. Last fall Pedri spoke at the New York Stock Exchange about her journey with cancer, providing hope for others at \"Shave 4 a Cure\" to benefit the Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation. Pedri received the Positivity and Perseverance Award in nursing at the School of Nursing and Public Health Convocation and Pinning May 18. It saved my life; it could save yours. uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending health care reform. The major reason nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of working conditions. With the high turnover rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff. Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the real problem is \"nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation.\" The operative has a degree of control over the timing of these two latter tasks- and throughout the shift would try and balance the timing so roving bobbins did not all run out together, producing a smoother and less stressful work flow. Ellen complained to her mother that she couldn't do this and couldn't 'keep all her ends up'. Ellen responded to the pressures by absconding, Mary responding by thinking Ellen was a bad child. Mary always returned Ellen to the mill where she would be punished. Mary sought the overseer to help her to discipline her child. The problem is e. that during pregnancy a woman has restrictions on what she can eat to get the adequate amounts for her and baby. As her tummy grew, her fear of birth also grew, but she found comfort in the fact that she would get an epidural in labor and she would have a painless labor and delivery. Many said “get it as soon as you get to the hospital”, and others said “don’t be a hero, just get it as soon as the contractions start hurting”. Suzy did not take a childbirth class. All of her friends discouraged taking classes. They took a class at the hospital and didn’t learn anything. Suzy believed with all of her heart they were right, so the only thing she focused on was preparing the nursery while she read some information on line about recovering, and newborn care. Her doctor ordered some blood tests and mentioned she might have to be induced. She anxiously waited for the call, and it came shortly after lunch the next day. The doctor confirmed his suspicions and told her that she would need to come in to the hospital for an induction the following morning. Suzy was still a bit confused. Suzy felt queasy and light headed. “Can we just schedule a cesarean instead?” Suzy was just as terrified of a cesarean as she was of giving birth naturally. “No, Suzy, I’m afraid that isn’t the best option. Suzy was irritated. “Don’t worry”, her doctor replied, “we’ll get you through it, I’ll see you in the morning\". Suzy stayed up late that night reading as much as she could about her condition. She fell asleep in bed with her laptop open and before she knew it the alarm clock was going off and it was time to head to the hospital. She couldn’t remember half of what she read about how to cope with the pain, and the things she did remember couldn’t be used because of her limitations of movement. She was strapped to a monitor that could only reach a few feet. She screamed, she cried, she withered in pain. Her husband cried in the corner, helpless and defeated. She begged for a cesarean, and after several hours, her doctor agreed that a cesarean would take place later that evening. In the end, Suzy had a healthy baby, but the memory of her birth left her feeling deeply depressed and symptoms of post traumatic stress syndrome was rearing it’s ugly head. This was Suzy’s situation. In a way, Suzy was a little more fortunate than some moms - she had some advance warning. That’s not the case for everyone. Each hospital and/or anesthesiologist has their own comfort level on when an epidural can and cannot be used.

Education systems around the world treat this topic differently, both directly through official policies and indirectly through cultural views on mental health and well-being. These curriculums are in place to effectively identify mental health disorders and treat it using therapy, medication, or other tools of alleviation. Prevalence of mental health issues in adolescents According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 46% of American adolescents aged 13–18 will suffer from some form of mental disorder. The most common types of disorders among adolescents as reported by the NIMH is anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and others), with a lifetime prevalence of about 25% in youth aged 13–18 and 6% of those cases being categorized as severe. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. There are an average of over 3,470 attempts by students in grades 9–12. Effects on academics and school life Mental disorders can lead to many academic problems, such as poor attendance, difficulties with academic performance, poor social integration, trouble adjusting to school, problems with behavior regulation, and attention and concentration issues. High school students who screen positive for psychosocial dysfunction report three times as many absent and tardy days as students who do not identify dysfunction, and students with high levels of psychosocial stress are much more likely to view themselves as academically incompetent. Anxiety Students with anxiety disorders are statistically less likely to attend college than those without, and those with social phobias are twice as likely to fail a grade or not finish high school as students who have never had the condition. Students may suffer from social anxiety, preventing them from going out and creating new relationships with new people or any social reaction one might come across. Depression In 2020, approximately 13% of youth aged 12 to 17 years old have had one major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year, with an overwhelming 70% left untreated. They also suggested that half of these students were failing or near-failing at the time of their deaths. In fact, students who perceive their academic performance as \"failing\" are three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who perceive their performance to be acceptable. These students can also struggle with time management and organization. Based on the drugs' function as a possible cognitive enhancer, common reasons of misuses by college students include better academic performance, feelings of euphoria, alertness and arousal, peer pressure, and weight loss. Middle school malaise Middle school malaise occurs in children during the transition from elementary school to middle school when they begin encountering many significant biological, psychological and environmental changes. These factors contribute to significant falling grades especially in the first year, and the poorer grades can lead to a continuing decline of motivation and self-confidence. Compared to elementary school where teachers are usually more task-oriented as simple goal of teaching and for children to learn, middle school values more of children's performance and the goal turns to become achieving a certain grade. Such a goal change might relate to negative effects on children's perception such as lower self-esteem and achievement loss. Studies also identified a developmental mismatch that as children are developing more cognitive ability neurologically, the increased constraints and discipline in middle school actually provide fewer opportunities for children's decision-making with lower cognitive involvement. Besides being more competitive, the middle school environment is also more complex and impersonal than elementary school with social life posing another significant challenge for children during the transition. The APA also points out that, currently, many psychologists believe children who think their intelligence can change over time importantly adjust better than those who think their intelligence is fixed during the transition. Policies in public schools United States Concerning U.S. state policies as of 2020, three states have approved mandatory mental health curriculums. In July 2018, New York and Virginia passed legislation that made mental health instruction mandatory in public education. New York has made it mandatory for students from Kindergarten to 12th grade to undergo\n\n signatures, and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions. While public support for strengthening gun laws rose 15 percent compared to a similar poll in 2011, there had been \"little change in attitudes about some longstanding proposals, including the outlawing of assault rifles.\" A law requiring background checks for all gun-show sales was favored by 92 percent of Americans and a law banning the sale and possession of high-capacity magazines (defined by the poll as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds) was supported by 62 percent of Americans. A record-high 74 percent opposed a ban on handguns and 51 percent opposed banning assault weapons. According to the Huffington Post, the Okay Public School Board of Education has instituted a policy of allowing teachers to have guns in their schools. Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.\" Superintendent Charles McMahan was quoted as saying that, \"No specific incident caused us to pass this policy. ...With everything that is going on in the world, we've heard that you may possibly see more attacks from \n\n also asserts that \"the safety of guns is less regulated than virtually any other commodity\". Overall, he remarks, \"We should no longer accept our high levels of lethal violence as an inevitable by-product of a free American society.\" He specifically criticizes the work of academic researchers John Lott, Jr. and Gary Kleck, both of which have published criminological studies finding no reason to think that the spread of guns leads to more crime. Hemenway argues as well that the correct interpretation of the Second Amendment is that \"rights should be determined and disputes resolved not through private judgment of each individual backed by private force \n\nCHICAGO -- Rambunctious third-graders filled a classroom in Seattle on a crisp autumn day. One of the students dropped his backpack, and horror ensued. That student had brought a parent's gun to school and was carrying it in his backpack. When the bag fell to the floor, the impact caused the gun to fire, sending a bullet straight into another student's abdomen, said Dr. Thomas Weiser, a trauma surgeon at Stanford University Medical Center. When the student arrived at the hospital, awake and alert with a bullet hole oozing blood just below her heart, she had a jarring expression of confusion in her brown eyes, Weiser said. Doctors also emphasize that there are methods available to safely secure and store firearms, away from children, and they recommend that parents employ those methods when keeping guns in the home. As for unintentional firearm injuries, Weiser said, the third-grade girl he treated was not the only accidental gunshot wound he saw in a child. Another such injury involved a boy around 9 who was given a handgun for his birthday. For suicides, which were calculated only for children 10 and older in the study, the researchers found that incidents were widely dispersed across the country. \"Just having access to a gun in a situation where you're upset with what's going on at school or with your friends, or your own internal emotional state, it unfortunately can lead to suicide. It's very important for parents to be aware of that, particularly if they have guns in the home.\" \"This is a very encouraging trend. \"Preventing such injuries and ensuring that all children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments remains one of our most important priorities.\" Fowler pointed to a collection of strategies that the CDC has developed to help states and communities build effective programs, policies and practices around violence prevention. Dr. Stephen Hargarten, professor and chairman of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, likened gun violence in America to a disease. \"The psychosocial components are related to the circumstances of these events, of the domestic violence disputes that result in children getting injured or killed, the psychological issues surrounding the transitions of thinking or feeling suicidal and ending their life,\" Hargarten said. \"Then the social aspects of this are related to the environmental circumstances,\" he said. \"And the social constructs of companies that make these products that are available to children, that can be used very easily by children, and so it really is a complex disease.\" \"That would have an impact in the home -- where, again, properly secure it -- but even if the child or young adult does find the gun, they can't use it because they're not authorized to access the gun,\" Hargarten said. Being mindful of who is nearby when a gun is being handled in the home can also play a role in injury prevention, said Wesson, the pediatric surgeon in Texas.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\" According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions. One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce. In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality. It also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about it.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

Each of these actions involves the potential deprivation of something valuable to a person or entity. For example, murder and abortion both involve the taking of a human life, which is generally considered to be of significant value. On the other hand, contraception and greenhouse gas emissions may impact the potential for future lives or the overall well-being of living beings. Secondly, the intentions and motivations behind these actions should be taken into account. The moral implications of an action can depend on the intention or purpose behind it. For instance, if an action is performed with the intention of causing harm or disregarding the well-being of others, it may be viewed as more morally problematic compared to actions taken with good intentions or for the greater good. Thirdly, the consequences and impact of these actions on individuals, society, and the environment need to be considered. Actions like murder and abortion usually have direct and immediate negative consequences for individuals involved, as they result in the loss of life or the potential for life. Conversely, issues like contraception and greenhouse gas emissions may have broader consequences, affecting the well-being of individuals, future generations, and the environment as a whole. It is also important to recognize that not all deprivation is necessarily wrongful or morally equivalent. The specific circumstances and context surrounding each action should be taken into account when assessing their moral implications. Additionally, the existence and discernibility of individuals impacted by these actions should not be limited to only those currently living. The moral duties and considerations may extend to non-discernible or non-existent people as well. In conclusion, when determining the moral implications of actions such as murder, abortion, contraception, greenhouse gas emissions, and the deprivation of non-discernible and non-existent people, factors such as the nature and value of life, intentions and motivations, consequences and impact, and the broader ethical context should all be carefully considered. It is important to approach each issue independently and recognize that they may have different moral implications and considerations. This principle states that if an action is directly undertaken for a moral reason and has an unintended, unavoidable, and negative effect, it may still be considered morally permissible. In the case of medical procedures, such as in the example of an ectopic pregnancy, where the embryo becomes lodged in the fallopian tube and poses a threat to the life of the woman, the Church may find it morally permissible to remove the affected section of the fallopian tube, which ultimately leads to the death of the embryo. According to the principle of double effect, there are certain conditions that must be met for the action to be considered morally permissible. in the scenarios, Cushman showed that the agent's belief and desire regarding a harmful action significantly influenced judgments of wrongness, permissibility, punishment, and blame. In one of his scenarios, a CEO of a corporation hears about a new \n\nThe main focus of deontological ethics is on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, rather than the consequences of those actions. Deontologists believe that ethical rules bind individuals to their duty or obligation. This approach emphasizes the importance of following moral principles and fulfilling one's obligations, regardless of the outcomes or consequences. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility. Teleological theories also consider the end goal or purpose of an action in assessing its morality. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D. Ross proposed a more flexible deontological theory where the consequences can sometimes override certain duties. Overall, deontological ethics focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves and emphasizes fulfilling one's duty or obligation, while consequentialist and teleological ethical theories consider the outcomes and purposes of actions in determining their morality. Reference:\n- Deontological Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n\nIn regards to the incident surrounding the death of Josie King (Josie King Foundation, 2002), there have been many great improvements in the delivery of care at Johns Hopkins (Niedowski, 2003; Zimmerman, 2004). Second, I would consider measuring processes that might have contributed to the death of Josie King. Josie King’s story (Josie King Foundation, 2002; Niedowski, 2003; Zimmerman, 2004) is heartbreaking, but the events told herein empowered Sorrel King, Josie’s mother, to take on a mission responsible for numerous patient care recommendations that have enhanced the safety of pediatric patients throughout the country. Josie was also allowed to drink, which she did fervently. The Institute of Medicine (2001) published six dimensions of health care: safety, effectiveness, patient-centered, timeliness, efficiency, and equality. In Josie’s case, the care was not delivered efficiently, effectively, safely, or in a patient- or family-centered fashion. Moreso, when the nurse administered the narcotic to Josie despite the pleadings of her mother, it demonstrated a lack of family-centered care, safety (in that, the order should have been double checked), efficacy (further demonstrating overuse of narcotic analgesia), and efficiency, as medication orders were either unclearly written or removed. (2001, July). Many people rely on EMS for problems that even they do not view as emergent, and others just plainly abuse the system. My primary motivations are my sense of community, my ability to reduce suffering, and my ability to raise the standard of care within the system. Maslow discusses how emergency situations can “obscure the ‘higher’ motivations [and create] a lopsided view of human capacities and human nature” (p. 375), and while my career is focused on responding to emergencies, this may hold true for me. While Maslow’s theory is not wholly accepted motivational schema (Robbins & Judge, 2010), EMS managers, and other public safety managers, would do well to understand this exception to motivational theory. There is a deep-seated belief that the workforce is lazy and will do anything possible to undermine the operation. Other theories, such as goal-setting, equity theory, and expectancy theory, as described in Robbins and Judge (2010), are all lacking in one particular constant: there is no constant in human behavior. It is the manner of this communication that will tend to fail or succeed, based on both the needs of the manager and the needs of the employee at the moment the message is passed. I have always maintained that the best thing that I have ever done for a patient was to hold their hand as they died; however, there are few scenarios that I can posit where I would ever cause the death of another, and I would never do it in my capacity as a medical professional. 3) in arguing for physician-assisted suicide and how the court deemed the “issue rests with the legislature, not with the court” (para 4).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

One example is the use of app-based well-being interventions, such as the HOW (Healthier Outcomes at Work) program, which was co-created and evaluated in the United Kingdom [reference text]. These types of interventions aim to improve mental health and well-being through mobile applications that provide various resources and tools. Another example is the use of digital learning platforms to mitigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers [reference text]. For instance, an innovative self-confidence webinar intervention has been evaluated for depression [reference text]. MoodGYM, for example, is an online self-help program that has been found acceptable by users [reference text]. These interventions typically involve guided meditation practices delivered through online platforms. Email-based interventions can also be effective in promoting well-being. There are several examples of digital interventions for mental health and well-being. One example is the use of smartphone apps to reduce depressive symptoms. Another example is web-based mindfulness interventions, which aim to improve mental well-being through practices like meditation and stress reduction techniques. Furthermore, there are interventions specifically designed for certain populations. For example, a study focused on healthcare workers developed a digital learning program to mitigate the psychological impact of COVID-19. It's important to note that adherence to these digital interventions can vary among individuals.

In contrast, researchers suspect that the \n\n the pandemic allowed them to appreciate the nursing profession. As the pandemic progressed, nurses developed a sense of gratefulness and self-reflection as opposed to the negative emotions during the initial stages of the pandemic. There are several potential benefits to using artificial intelligence for depression, as we'll outline below. Those who develop artificial intelligence based programs work diligently, using extraordinary amounts of data, to create a similar space that allows people to feel connected and understood. In addition to the felt sense of emotional connection, artificial intelligence connects people with needed services who may otherwise not be able to access help. The ability to access and use mental health resources that are designed using artificial intelligence can be a lifeline of hope for people in areas where there is little to no help available. The use of mobile apps and artificial intelligence platforms allows for people to receive mental health services in the safety of their personal living space. Being able to maintain our privacy while talking about difficult things in the comfort of our personal space, and doing all of this at our convenience, can be very appealing. Many of the obstacles that might prevent people from seeking and receiving help for depression are removed, or at least minimized, by artificial intelligence based programs available. However, it is critically important to note that these technology based resources using artificial intelligence are not intended to replace clinical treatment of depression or any other mental health issue. Below are some examples artificial intelligence based technology that can be used to help fight depression. It is designed to offer convenient care to those struggling with depression by mimicking human conversation, offering self-help related guidance and companionship to its users. The program can share with you information and resources, such as videos and exercises, based on what it thinks you are needing at that time. WoeBot can be used anonymously on iPhones and iPads and you can also chat with it through Facebook Messenger. The basis of WoeBot is designed with influence from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapeutic framework that works to help people change their unhelpful thinking and behaviors, ideally leading to improved mood and decision making. As you continue to chat with WoeBot, it collects data through natural language processing (NLP) and uses this information to get to know you better. The collected information allows for the program to more accurately detect and meet your emotional needs at a given time, offering personalized resources, self-help guidance, information and support related to your concerns. Wysa is described on the company site as an artificial intelligence-based, \"emotionally intelligent\" bot that is able to \"help you manage your emotions and thoughts.\" Just like WoeBot, Wysa is designed with influences from CBT to help you challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. As with other AI-based programs, Wysa continues to collect data as you chat in order to more accurately read and meet your behavioral and mental health needs. You can use Wysa anonymously, similar to WoeBot. Another artificial intelligence platform used for mental health care, Tess is described as \"a psychological AI that administers highly personalized psycho-education and health-related reminders on demand.\" The collection of data through consistent messaging allows Tess to determine appropriate responses and offer helpful information and guidance that is relevant to your struggles. It is described as using artificial intelligence to be able to adapt to the user's personal needs and goals. X2AI, the company that developed Tess, states that this program is not intended to replace clinical therapy, but designed to be used as additional support in the treatment process. The interventions of Tess, like the others described so far, are influenced by the framework of cognitive behavioral therapy. Researchers and programmers in the field of artificial intelligence are working diligently to bring those same qualities to technology-based mental health care. Tess, WoeBot, Wysa, and other similar programs are offering accessibility by being available for use 24/7 at little to no cost to the user. Many people value their privacy and, at times, enjoy the anonymity that technology can provide. When considering the sensitive and\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception. In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. For instance, whether a particular killing was done in self-defense or in order to facilitate a robbery is probably relevant to whether it is wrong.

Supporters of duty-based morality believe that feeding the patient is the right and responsibility of the doctor, regardless of the anticipated outcome. In this perspective, the doctor may justify the morbidity or even mortality of a few patients if it has the potential to benefit a majority of patients. For example, a doctor may support a controlled clinical trial, accepting the potential harm to a few individuals in order to derive overall benefits for a larger population. Rights-based morality, which is the dominant contemporary theme and a fundamental principle of medical law, condemns an action if it wrongs someone or violates a patient's right to determine their own destiny. These three perspectives offer different recommendations for treatment in various ethical dilemmas. For example, the duty-based moralist would always feed the patient, while the goal-based or utilitarian doctor would feed the patient when appropriate in their healthcare setting, based on scientific evidence and justifiable outcomes. The rights-based moralist emphasizes the importance of patient autonomy and would act in accordance with the patient's wishes and rights.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

Those who had been spanked also performed worse on IQ studies. “Aversive disciplinary strategies, including all forms of corporal punishment and yelling at or shaming children, are minimally effective in the short-term and not effective in the long-term. With new evidence, researchers link corporal punishment to an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children,” the policy statement asserts. The policy guideline comes at a time of heightened awareness of the long-term brain effects of child abuse and neglect in all its forms. In November, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued its own recommendations for primary care physicians on child abuse prevention, citing evidence of the ill effects of childhood abuse and neglect and finding current preventative efforts insufficient. “Child abuse and neglect, also referred to as child maltreatment—words or actions that cause or fail to protect children from harm, potential harm, or the threat of harm—is associated with negative physical and emotional health outcomes that persist and can lead to serious disorders throughout the life course,” the Task Force said in its statement. Instead of corporal or harsh verbal punishment, the AAP policy emphasizes “positive parenting,” which includes modeling the type of behavior that is expected, preparing for situations that might elicit unruly behavior, and reinforcing good behavior in children. When a rule is broken and the need for stronger discipline arises, the AAP suggests age-appropriate interventions such as redirecting the child’s attention elsewhere (for infants/toddlers) or a time-out period equal to one minute per year of age. Some examples include:\n\n1. Failure to promote appropriate socialization: This can involve isolating the child, not providing opportunities for social interactions or education, involving children in unlawful activities, or not providing adequate stimulation and support for their development. It is important to note that these signs should be observed consistently over time to raise suspicion of emotional abuse or neglect. Overall, it is crucial to carefully observe and assess a child's behavior towards their parent or carer, considering these signs as potential indicators of neglect or physical abuse. at the cost of his morality but continues the work. After finishing the transcript, Belt goes shopping for a gift for Blank. The clerk suggests an “Executioner’s Set,” and Belt clarifies he doesn’t want a toy that’ll harm or kill his Curio.

It is important for parents to express displeasure about specific events without resorting to derogatory statements about the child. Similarly, frequent mild physical punishment, or corporal punishment, can become less effective over time and may increase the risk of child abuse. It teaches children that it is acceptable to use physical force in certain situations, leading to aggressive behavior towards others, including their siblings. Moreover, threats by parents to leave or give up the child can be extremely psychologically damaging. Discipline should focus on teaching children what is expected of them, reinforcing positive behaviors, and setting proper limits for negative behaviors. Parents should understand that their child is inherently good, even if they engage in occasional misbehavior. Overall, it is crucial for parents to adopt positive discipline techniques that promote healthy emotional development, self-esteem, and a sense of security in children. This can include techniques such as positive reinforcement, setting clear boundaries, and using logical consequences rather than resorting to scolding, physical punishment, or threats. Reference:\nThreatening a mild loss of privileges (no video games for 1 week or grounding a teenager) may be appropriate, but the consequence must be enforced if there is a violation.Children of any age may remain fearful and anxious about loss of the parent long after the threat is made; however many children are able to see through empty threats.Parents who set too few reasonable limits may be frustrated by children who cannot control their own behavior. Commonly used techniques to control undesirable behaviors in children include scolding, physical punishment, and threats. These techniques have potential adverse effects on children’s sense of security and self-esteem. It is important to educate parents that they have a good child who does bad things from time to time, so parents do not think and tell the child that he or she is “bad.”\\n\\nFrequent mild physical punishment (corporal punishment) may become less effective over time and tempt the parent to escalate the physical punishment, increasing the risk of child abuse.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

The study authors worry that the acclaimed drama could be giving patients inaccurate expectations for their own outcomes and their family members’ outcomes in an emergency medicine scenario. Also in the current season, one of the main characters, Dr. Miranda Bailey, an African-American woman, suffers a heart attack but is told by multiple white male doctors that her symptoms are stress-related. In 2008, during Season 4, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a study in partnership with the show’s writers that demonstrated how the drama could effectively persuade misinformed viewers. By working with the showrunners to write a character arc that addresses how likely it is for an HIV-positive mother to transmit the disease to an unborn child — not that likely, with proper treatment — and surveying viewers before and after watching the episode, researchers found that the show has the very real potential to clear up misconceptions about health topics.

But whatever the total relevant non-moral facts are (i.e., that Brenda killed Charles during a robbery, and she was not previous enslaved, etc. ), then if the principle of moral supervenience is true, then any other killing where those same non-moral facts are true has the same moral properties as Brenda's killing of Charles. For instance, it is not possible for Brenda's killing of Charles to be right, and Sam's killing of \n\n or a bad person.

In this scenario, a pregnant woman seeks medical counseling regarding potential risks associated with her pregnancy. However, the advisor mistakenly provides incorrect information, leading the woman to decide to undergo an abortion. Later, it is discovered that the information given by the advisor was wrong. The second type involves misinformation about the health of the fetus. Here, the woman seeks advice concerning the health and well-being of her fetus, and decides to have an abortion after being informed that the fetus is deformed or disabled. These cases represent a mirror image of wrongful abortion cases, although they are not exact reflections.

Such is the case with Professor John Gluck, a former primate researcher who conducted lab research decades ago, in the 1960s-1980s, during a time with different standards and regulations compared to contemporary practice. Gluck writes about his own ethical unease which eventually led him to abandon his work with animals and to argue that the existing system for reviewing and conducting animal research should be revised. Gluck appears to think that if others have not arrived at his same conclusion it must be because of their failure to engage in moral reasoning. The results of this ongoing, thoughtful reflection are personal and professional codes of ethics, laws and regulations in the US and other countries, and widespread societal changes in our views and treatment of other animals. Society as a whole considers as morally permissible the regulated and justified use of animals to advance medical knowledge, to improve the well-being of human and nonhuman animals alike, and to understand the health of the environment. As a society we must grapple with and debate these questions and arrive at a democratic decision to such moral disputes. They incorrectly assert that scientists can do as they please in their laboratories or, worse, that scientists, veterinarians and technicians do not truly care about the well-being of their animal subjects. Indeed, Professor Gluck attempted to reinforce such falsehoods about animal research and animal researchers in his op-ed piece. Gluck argues that the US government should convene a national commission to consider the ethical treatment of nonhuman animals in medical research. But even restricting the discussion to nonhuman primates (the topic of Gluck’s essay) it is also the case that nonhuman primates are a small, but important, fraction- generally less than 1%- of captive animals involved in research. The gross majority are licensed zoos, or various entertainment venues for the public. When such inversion of priorities is made evident, one must conclude that it is not those seeking to advance knowledge and human health via carefully regulated work who are at fault in their moral reasoning. Scientists, students, veterinarians, and staff who engage in biomedical and behavioral research with animals do it not because they have failed to consider the moral issues. As the National Institutes of Health convenes this week to examine the science and ethics of research with nonhuman primates, one must remember the important contributions the work has made to the study of child health and development, diabetes and obesity, mental health, transplant tolerance, vaccines, HIV/AIDS, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the development of brain-machine interfaces, among many other areas.

Fact: according to federal regulations that this article claims assures “animal welfare”, a cage for a macaque (pictured above) is required to be a few feet by a few feet, and the animal is required to have “mental stimulation” which at minimum means one toy. Fact: mice are not considered “animals” according to the USDA AWA and therefore not regulated and therefore the set up of the happy mice with nice enrichment to hide, chew on, build a nest (all things very essential for natural mouse behavior) is very rarely seen in research settings. What is the “However…” about here? Is the implication that the commission Gluck imagines would be required to consider the well-being of creatures used in those other ways also? Second, I would consider measuring processes that might have contributed to the death of Josie King. In this instance, Josie was administered a narcotic while suffering acute dehydration. This measure should account for the time between a crisis and upgrade along with a statement indicating the cause of the crisis and resultant upgrade. After much demanding by Sorrel, a medication was administered to Josie to counteract the narcotic analgesia she had been administered. Josie was also allowed to drink, which she did fervently. The Institute of Medicine (2001) published six dimensions of health care: safety, effectiveness, patient-centered, timeliness, efficiency, and equality. In Josie’s case, the care was not delivered efficiently, effectively, safely, or in a patient- or family-centered fashion. As Josie exhibited extreme thirst, her symptoms were dismissed, which does not follow patient-centeredness. Moreso, when the nurse administered the narcotic to Josie despite the pleadings of her mother, it demonstrated a lack of family-centered care, safety (in that, the order should have been double checked), efficacy (further demonstrating overuse of narcotic analgesia), and efficiency, as medication orders were either unclearly written or removed. (2001, July). There are drawbacks, however. Many people rely on EMS for problems that even they do not view as emergent, and others just plainly abuse the system. My primary motivations are my sense of community, my ability to reduce suffering, and my ability to raise the standard of care within the system. Maslow discusses how emergency situations can “obscure the ‘higher’ motivations [and create] a lopsided view of human capacities and human nature” (p. 375), and while my career is focused on responding to emergencies, this may hold true for me. While Maslow’s theory is not wholly accepted motivational schema (Robbins & Judge, 2010), EMS managers, and other public safety managers, would do well to understand this exception to motivational theory. There is a deep-seated belief that the workforce is lazy and will do anything possible to undermine the operation. McGregor highlights this and cautions that it a result of poor management technique, not a cause that is easily rectified by the chosen technique. Other theories, such as goal-setting, equity theory, and expectancy theory, as described in Robbins and Judge (2010), are all lacking in one particular constant: there is no constant in human behavior. There are a number of ways that a single motivational factor might influence a particular person on any particular day. It is the manner of this communication that will tend to fail or succeed, based on both the needs of the manager and the needs of the employee at the moment the message is passed. I have always maintained that the best thing that I have ever done for a patient was to hold their hand as they died; however, there are few scenarios that I can posit where I would ever cause the death of another, and I would never do it in my capacity as a medical professional. Saunders and Smith (2010) describe the use of “semantic ploys” (para. 3) in arguing for physician-assisted suicide and how the court deemed the “issue rests with the legislature, not with the court” (para 4). Not all non-moral predicates are typically thought to be relevant to the application of a moral predicate. For instance, whether a particular killing was done in self-defense or in order to facilitate a robbery is probably relevant to whether it is wrong. But whether it happens in Greenland or England, or in the morning or at night, is not relevant. For instance, if it was \n\nThe three common themes that distinguish different individuals' perspectives on ethical debate in the field of healthcare are duty-based morality, goal-based or utilitarianism, and rights-based morality. Duty-based morality focuses on the intrinsic merits of a medical decision, prioritizing the sanctity of life regardless of the consequences. Supporters of duty-based morality believe that feeding the patient is the right and responsibility of the doctor, regardless of the anticipated outcome. Goal-based or utilitarianism perspective requires healthcare professionals to judge the general aggregate of good based on the consequences of an action rather than the act itself. In this perspective, the doctor may justify the morbidity or even mortality of a few patients if it has the potential to benefit a majority of patients. For example, a doctor may support a controlled clinical trial, accepting the potential harm to a few individuals in order to derive overall benefits for a larger population. Rights-based morality, which is the dominant contemporary theme and a fundamental principle of medical law, condemns an action if it wrongs someone or violates a patient's right to determine their own destiny. Doctors who follow this perspective prioritize respecting patient autonomy and would oppose actions that violate the patient's rights. These three perspectives offer different recommendations for treatment in various ethical dilemmas. For example, the duty-based moralist would always feed the patient, while the goal-based or utilitarian doctor would feed the patient when appropriate in their healthcare setting, based on scientific evidence and justifiable outcomes. The rights-based moralist emphasizes the importance of patient autonomy and would act in accordance with the patient's wishes and rights. In the given scenario, the patient had previously expressed a firm rejection of being placed on a respirator under any circumstances, and this wish was documented in their advance directive. However, there is an ethical dilemma presented when the attending physician and family members arrive slightly delayed and find that the patient has already been intubated and placed on the respirator. They would view both scenarios as allowing the patient to die, and therefore believe that stopping the life-support in this case would be morally justified. On the other hand, there are those who consider the difference between stopping and not starting life-support to be morally important, even when all other circumstances are the same. They may argue that in this specific case, the delay in arrival does not morally justify a refusal by the staff to remove the patient from the respirator. The specific details of each case can introduce complex ethical considerations that require careful evaluation by healthcare professionals, in accordance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D.

One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce. In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality. It also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about it. The main branches of ethics are normative ethics, meta-ethics and applied ethics. The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are:\n\nThe criminal responsibility exception for the insane is a legal principle that recognizes that individuals who are determined to be legally insane at the time of committing a crime may not be held fully responsible for their actions. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. The second is the irresistible impulse test, which considers whether the individual had the ability to control their behavior and prevent themselves from committing the crime due to their mental condition. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.
