We can see how the WHO has observed trends within the system and attempted to bring notice of these trends to light via their annual reports. The World Health Report 2006 highlighted the estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, nurses, midwives, and other health human resources worldwide, calling the situation a \"global health workforce crisis\". The reports above provide us with some perspective of the shifting demands worldwide, including an aging population, growing influence of chronic disease, loss of primary care support and the changing needs related to health care strategy. The foundation of our program is focused on stress, nutrition and your ability to sleep as these three key elements dramatically influence quality of life and overall success in any oncology program. Exhaustion from both treatment and just life management is the number one demand we seek to reduce. From there we seek to make sure you understand your options for everyday living, how to manage these options and make decisions that bring you the most benefit. We use strategic planning to help reduce stress, improve diet and improve sleep and to develop dynamic program modifications as we anticipate progression throughout the care plan. Research over the past decade suggests that conditions like heart disease, joint disorders and digestive disorders are near the top the list of U.S. healthcare costs at $107 billion, $62 billion and $51 billion respectively. If we dig into how chronic diseases affect our daily lives, we see issues such as migraines, which influence the daily lives of approximately 17% of the population at a cost of care and lost productivity estimated as high as $17 billion per year. One in three Americans are said to have at least one of the top 7 chronic diseases, with a current overall economic impact of $1.3 trillion -- of which $1.1 trillion is lost workplace productivity. At the same time our strategy must include a target that can be realistically pursued instead of the current standard of care which suggests that chronic diseases can only be managed. The pursuit of quality of life must be the target of a new standard of care when considering chronic disease. Holistic health care practitioners focus patient care on the unique needs and nature of the person who has an illness rather\n\nNorthShore offers cost-effective, independent medical record review services to both patients and organizations.

Product tampering can severely impact your health and your business. In order to reduce product contamination, it is important to evaluate the complete product lifecycle and identify key break points where tampering can be made possible. Contaminants can be introduced to a product at varying stages—during processing, packaging, storage, distribution and purchase. On a case by case basis, our team can evaluate the risk of poison contamination from tampered products. This evaluation typically involves a visit to your manufacturing site to evaluate, review and identify any operational steps that may lead to tampered goods. We will also work with retail and wholesale stores to determine the cause of tampered products. Our team provides limited risk assessment of poisons to both patients and organizations.

As many of you may know, Skin-Cap was a popular over-the-counter (OTC) spray product that claimed its only active ingredient was zinc pyrithione, an ingredient approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OTC products in treating dandruff. The FDA removed it from the consumer market in August 1997 because the FDA determined that it contained a prescription medication that was not listed on the label. Congressional law requires all medications containing prescription ingredients be approved and regulated by the FDA to ensure that consumers are aware of the benefits and side effects of the drugs. Cheminova, the Spanish manufacturer of Skin-Cap, did not disclose that its product contained a prescription ingredient nor did the company submit an application to the FDA for the product's approval for sale in the U.S. More than 100 Skin-Cap users told the NPF that the product caused severe adverse reactions, and several dermatologists reported similar experiences in some of their Skin-Cap patients, who in some cases required hospitalization. Many of them also felt that Skin-Cap worked better than the available clobetasol propionate products (including prescription brand Temovate). These people said they had not observed any problems in using Skin-Cap. Because of the overwhelming interest in this issue, both from people who liked Skin-Cap and wanted it back, and from people who were concerned about its side effects, the NPF decided to investigate the composition of Skin-Cap and what might be necessary to bring it back to the consumer market. We would like to share with you the results of that investigation -- what we did and what we learned. An overview is presented in the letter below and the details are provided in the accompanying questions and answers. That's why we initiated our Skin-Cap investigation more than two years ago, to learn what might be done to get someone to bring it back to the market, and, toward that end, to possibly identify any additional unlisted ingredients. We formulated a strategy to address this very complicated issue as effectively as we could with the limited resources we had available. As a result of our research, we believe that clobetasol propionate was the primary reason for Skin-Cap's effectiveness. We brought this issue to two companies that seriously considered the product, and one may be pursuing testing at this time. We appeal to Cheminova to disclose the full list of Skin-Cap ingredients and to go through the established legal channels to seek approval of the product and re-introduction to the U.S. market. An FDA representative has advised us the agency is willing to review an application for approval of a Skin-Cap-type product. If the company continues to show no interest in pursuing legal channels of approval, someone else would have to conduct an expensive full-scale analysis of Skin-Cap to identify all of the ingredients. However, we hope that in reading this article you will understand the issues with which we have struggled and the limitations we have faced in conducting this investigation. If you have any further questions, or would like copies of our test results, please call us at (503) 244-7404. You may ask for Corrine Kail at extension 16, or e-mail us at questions@npfusa.org. What would be required to bring a Skin-Cap product back to the U.S. market? The most obvious way to get Skin-Cap back on the U.S. market would be for Cheminova to submit the product to the FDA for approval, which would involve clinical trials to demonstrate that it works and that it is safe. In lieu of that, another pharmaceutical company could try to bring a similar product to market, but this would require knowledge of the product's exact ingredients. As no one other than Cheminova knows exactly what is in Skin-Cap, the product would have to be reverse engineered to identify all of its ingredients. The independent laboratory that assisted us with our Skin-Cap testing said that to reverse engineer the product and figure out exactly what was in it would require an investment of at least one year and several hundred thousand dollars -- money the NPF does not have. Even if the product's ingredients could be identified, it would still need to be a prescription medication (due to the clobetasol propionate), and it would require millions of dollars to conduct the necessary clinical trials to prove its safety. Because the testing and development process that is required for prescription products can take 5-7 years, at a minimum expense of $20 million, a company would have to be convinced that the product would be very promising to warrant such an investment. It is clear that because Skin-Cap is such a complicated substance, a company wanting to try to bring a Skin-Cap-type product to the market would face millions of dollars in costs, years of development and a very uncertain outcome. Was it possible to identify additional unlabeled ingredients in Skin-Cap that might help explain why it seemed to work so well for some people, or to learn about any additional safety hazards? What might be done to get someone to bring Skin-Cap back to the market legitimately? We gathered data from Skin-Cap users, members, physicians whose patients used Skin-Cap, and other researchers. We requested all records of the FDA's testing of Skin-Cap, and had those documents analyzed by a chemist at an independent, nonprofit laboratory. We explored the possibility and the costs for someone to reverse engineer Skin-Cap, and we researched the steps that would be required to bring such a product to market legally.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about public relations.
