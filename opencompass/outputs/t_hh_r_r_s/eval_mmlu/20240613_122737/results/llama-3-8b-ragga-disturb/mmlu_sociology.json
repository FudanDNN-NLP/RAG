By ensuring that students were exposed to the concept of evolution from an early age, the Chinese educational system helped to establish a foundational understanding of the theory. Furthermore, the mass media in China played a significant role in disseminating information about evolution. They actively promoted and popularized the theory through various means, such as documentaries, scientific articles, and public discussions. Social and political movements in China also played a part in shaping public acceptance of evolution. Ideological arguments about evolution became entwined with larger societal and political debates, which helped to legitimize and popularize the theory among the Chinese population. However, it is unlikely for other countries to replicate this level of acceptance for several reasons. The specific history and cultural context of China greatly influenced the acceptance of evolution. The interactions among science, education, mass media, social and political movements, and ideological arguments created a unique environment that is difficult to reproduce elsewhere. However, the unique historical and cultural context of China makes it unlikely for other countries to replicate this level of acceptance, as different countries have their own distinct challenges and circumstances.

In America, this type of city is usually found in areas where coal mining was the main industry in the city, and once coal mines were shut down, the city became a ghost city rampant with unemployment and displaced workers.

While urban anthropology is a newly acknowledged field (Prato and Pardo 2013), anthropologists have been conducting work in the area for a long time. For instance, numerous early scholars have attempted to define exactly what the city is and pinpoint the ways in which urbanism sets apart modern city lifestyles from what used to be regarded as the \"primitive society\". It is increasingly acknowledged in urban anthropology that, although there are significant differences in the characteristics and forms of \n\n Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the \"Global city\".

Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: \"The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. An example would be the selective application of drug laws ... against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations\" Academic Noam Chomsky argues that drug laws are currently, and have historically, been used by the state to oppress sections of society it opposes: \"Very commonly substances are criminalized because they're associated with what's called the dangerous classes, poor people, or working people. It is one of the major complications of chronic exposure to cannabis as it includes the effects and elements of cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment that are similar to what appears in schizophrenia and depression. It is characterized by a gradual detachment and disconnect from the outer world due to a loss of emotional reactivity, drives, and aims. Responsiveness to any stimuli is limited, and those affected are unable to experience or anticipate any pleasure except through the use of cannabis. Marijuana amotivational syndrome has been looked at within the context of how motivation-related constructs influence the young adult in the context of \n\n minimal physiological action rather than being a direct cause of the psychological changes seen in users. Additionally, though research has been conducted, it is recognized that there is not enough substantial empirical research to conclude that the use of cannabis leads to amotivational syndrome. Amotivational syndrome still ranks high among the key problems associated with the drug, with researchers having adopted the phrase “amotivational” to describe lethargic cannabis users. The US Department of Health and Human Services also warns that usage in youth may result in amotivational symptoms such as an apathetic \n\n Washington was among many states to criminalize cannabis in the 1920s. The Washington State Legislature passed House Bill 3 in 1923, which defined \"cannabis americana\" and \"cannabis indica\" as narcotic drugs. Possession was punishable by one to 10 years in prison. In western states such as Washington, cannabis prohibition was largely motivated by the drug's association with the growing number of Mexican American immigrants. As racial and anti-immigrant tensions rose, newspapers published sensationalized stories of the drug causing Mexicans to go insane and commit violent crimes. In 1971, the state legislature reduced the crime of possession of 40 grams or less to a misdemeanor, and no longer considered the drug to be an \"opiate\" or \"narcotic.\" However, marijuana remained a Schedule I drug under both the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and Washington's own Controlled Substance Act of 1971, which deem the drug to have a \"high potential for abuse\" and \"no currently accepted medical use.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

This study explores the relationship between social support and unwanted pregnancy among Pakistani women. This cross-sectional study was conducted at four teaching hospitals in Lahore in 2014. A total of 500 pregnant women who visited the hospitals’ obstetrics and gynecology departments were asked to respond to a questionnaire consisting of respondents’ characteristics and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Unwanted pregnancies were more likely to occur among pregnant women from rural areas, with low scores on the SPS ‘reassurance of worth’ sub-scale, no history of contraceptive use, and who already had at least one son than those with no sons. All of these factors increase neonatal care costs, and other costs related to long-term disability in women and babies . In countries such as Pakistan where it is illegal, women resort to untrained midwives and untrained health professionals . They include socioeconomic disparities, lack of social support, the mother’s age, parity and maternal behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption [5, 6]. These risk factors are stable across cultures and found in different regions of the world. Daughters are seen as inferior to sons, and consequently have poor access to healthcare and educational opportunities [2, 8]. This sociocultural difference contributes to honor killings, the bride price, and dowry system, the lower status of female legal testimony, forced marriages, and the denial of a woman’s right to have a career [2, 8]. In contrast, sons are viewed as breadwinners and agents of the continuation of the family name. Perceived social support has also been shown to be a strong predictor of attitudes, practices and knowledge regarding unwanted pregnancies. Support from the family, and society in general, helps a woman adjust to her new social role as a mother . This study explores the factors associated with unintended pregnancies, with a focus on gender disparity, family systems, and societal support among Pakistani women. All pregnant women assessed as having low or lower middle income, who visited the departments for routine antenatal care were included. Participants provided demographic information, family structure and were asked to evaluate the state of their pregnancy, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and perceived levels of social support using the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Perceived social support was assessed with Urdu version of the SPS , originally developed by Weiss . This scale has been cross-culturally validated among the Pakistani population, and has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties . The six provisions as assessed with SPS are: (a) attachment: emotional closeness from which one derives a sense of security; (b) social integration: a sense of belonging to a group of people who share common interests, recreational activities and concerns; (c) reassurance of worth: acknowledgment of one’s competence and skills; (d) reliable alliance: the assurance that one can count on others for assistance under any circumstances; (e) guidance: advice and information; and (f) opportunities to nurture: the sense that others rely upon one for their well-being [13, 14]. Education, background (rural vs urban), household income (low vs high), number of daughters and sons, and scores on Social Provisions Scale were entered as covariates in the regression model. The mean age was 27.41 (5.65), most were from rural areas, from a low socioeconomic class, and had not completed high school. An analysis of HADS scores showed that a high percentage of women suffered from antenatal anxiety (245, 49%) and depression (159, 31.8%). The demographic characteristics of respondents and their mean (SD) SPS scores are presented in Table 1. Our findings related to antenatal anxiety and depression in this sample can be read elsewhere (Additional file 1). Parity among mothers was associated positively with unplanned pregnancies (r = 0.19, p < 0.001) and insignificantly with social support (r = − 0.04, p > 0.05). Women from rural areas had higher odds of having an unplanned pregnancy than their urban counterparts. On the other hand, education level, household income, having daughters, total number of children, attachment, social integration, reliable alliance, and guidance were insignificant predictors (Table 2). Our study found a high prevalence of unwanted pregnancies among Pakistani women who lived in rural areas, scored low on the ‘reassurance of worth’ SPS\n\n Queer anti-urbanism manifests in practice in a variety of ways, which Herring refers to under the umbrella term of \"critical rusticity.\" Some examples include the rural, all-female \"Lesbian Separatist\" communities that consciously spurned \"the city\" in favor of rural alternatives to a subjugated status under metronormative, white-male-centric, upper-middle-class gay culture. Such communities contradicted the gay rural-urban migration narrative, defying the values of metronormativity and replacing them with a new value system that was simultaneously rural and queer. Publications such as Rural Fairie Digest and Country Women countered rural queer erasure, provided alternatives to gay consumer culture through 'how to's' on DIY 'country skills,' and to some extent provided a sense of rural queer community even for those who were geographically isolated. urban) promotes an alternative to metronormativity, where differences in rural queer life and urban queer life are viewed not as deficiencies, but rather as value-neutral differences. The Progressive Era, with its emphasis on factualism and scientific inquiry produced hundreds of community studies, mostly using descriptive statistics to cover issues of poverty, crime, migration, religiosity, education, and public health. The emergence of systematic social science, especially sociology, shifted the center of class studies into sociology departments. The most representative example was the Middletown books by Robert Lynd and Helen Lynd, which gave a microscopic look at class structures in a typical small city (Muncie, Indiana). After 1960 localized studies gave way to national surveys, with special emphasis on the process of social mobility and stratification. A classic theme was trying to see if the middle class was shrinking, or if the opportunities for upward mobility had worsened over time. After 1960 a growing concern with education led to many studies dealing with racial integration, and performance in schools by racial and gender groupings. The disposable income of the American upper class was sharply reduced by high income tax rates during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. During this period corporate executives had relatively modest incomes, lived modestly, and had few servants. now studies following people from Europe to America over their lifetimes. Labor historians have moved from a focus on national labor unions to microscopic studies of the workers in particular industries in particular cities. The consensus has been that the workers had their own political and cultural value system. The political values were based on a producer's ethic, that is the working class was the truly productive sector of society, and expressed a version of republicanism that was similar to the middle class version. This enabled the businessman's party, the Republican party, to enjoy a strong base among Protestant blue collar workers, and prevented the emergence of a strong Socialist movement.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

This can create some confusion for staff who are trying to locate the patient for a procedure, for laboratory tests, or even to bring them their selected meal from the cafeteria. Because these are PC based systems, they allow interoperability with other systems that may need to be accessed to retrieve other essential information needed for care. These systems rely on an RFID tag on the patients’ hospital bracelets and RFID readers that automatically pick up the patient as they reach key locations. But what if there was a way to leverage the same patient tracking system to reduce the anxiety of waiting? An added benefit of a patient tracking system is the ability to push the same data into waiting room environments so that loved ones can keep informed on the status of patients as well. If you’re worried about privacy, you need not be. These systems allow the information to be customized to each screen the data is being sent to. This is given to the family so that they can check the status of their loved one on the screen, without disclosing their names and procedures to the rest of the waiting public. However, one sure fire way to help reduce this anxiety is to provide easy access to the status of each patient. Launch an internet browser, select the proper facility, enter the patient ID and then the patient’s progress is shown on the screen. This assures that each display presents the relevant information to either inform the staff or to comply with HIPPA and protect the privacy of patients. Handled correctly however, the system can reduce the cost of care and provide a value added service that reduces the anxiety of those waiting in the hospital as well.

With the advancement of new technologies, the act of monitoring and watching people online has increased between the years of 2010-2020.The invasion of privacy and recording people without consent leads to people doubting the usage of technologies which are suppose to secure and protect personal information. The storage of data and intrusiveness in digital surveillance effects human behavior. The psychological implications of digital surveillance can cause people to have concern, worry, or fear about feeling monitored all the time. Digital data is stored within security technologies, apps, social media platforms, and other technological devices that can be used in various ways for various reasons. Data collected from people using the internet can be subject to being monitored and viewed by private and public companies, friends, and other known or unknown entities. Electronic monitoring, they argue, saves cash poor state valuable resources while benefitting offenders who can become productive. In addition, proponents of electronic monitoring say the technology can be used to incapacitate violent criminals and reduce recidivism, though studies on the use of electronic monitors to reduce repeat offenses have produced mixed results. **Proponents of the use of electronic monitors to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue the devices: < 1) are more cost-effective for states that can ill afford the high price of brick and mortar prisons and jails. 3) allow individuals to maintain a family life and participate in treatment 4) can avert further victimization of innocent people. 5) ease prison overcrowding, improving the lives of inmates inside carceral institutions. 6) punish offenders without being too harsh 7) improve the lives of individuals who might otherwise languish in prison or jail **Opponents of the use of technology to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue \n\nThe technologies of the digital age can have negative effects on privacy and personal data protection. With unregulated access to information and personal data stored in various nodes of the global network, there is a possibility for these technologies to violate the basic principles of information security and privacy. Unregulated access to information: The digital age allows for easy access to vast amounts of information. However, this also means that personal data can be accessed by unauthorized individuals or organizations, leading to potential privacy breaches. Social computing: The rise of social media platforms and online communities has led to increased sharing of personal information. This can result in privacy risks, as individuals may unknowingly disclose personal details that can be exploited by malicious actors. However, relying on third-party providers to store personal data can present privacy concerns. The interconnected nature of these devices increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information. Moreover, the aggregation of data from multiple sources can lead to re-identification and potential privacy violations. To address these challenges, it is essential to establish robust legislation and regulations for privacy and personal data protection. Organizations should implement security measures to safeguard personal data, such as encryption, authentication, and access controls. Additionally, individuals should be educated about privacy risks and take steps to protect their personal information, such as using strong passwords and reviewing privacy settings on digital platforms.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

It refers to the shared beliefs, customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next. It involves the division of society into various social groups, such as families, communities, and social classes. These are established systems or organizations that serve specific functions and fulfill collective needs. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. The German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society). Gemeinschaft relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society. Max Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Geert Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals. Hofstede insights describes collectivism as: \"Collectivism, represents a preference for a tightly-knit framework in society in which individuals can expect their relatives or members of a particular ingroup to look after them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.\" In the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state. Similarly, classical anarchism is synonymous with \"libertarian socialism\" in their shared commitments to autonomy and freedom, decentralization, opposing hierarchy, and opposing the vanguardism of authoritarian socialism. While there are differences between each, including whether their adherents personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\", each still classifies as anti-authoritarian socialism. Classical anarchism is distinguished from general Marxism by its opposition to centralized or authoritarian organizational structures and \n\n described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human \"social action\"—especially among \"ideal types\", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as \"historical, invariant, or generalisable\" as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\"). These structures may include educational institutions, economic systems, religious organizations, political systems, and legal frameworks. It is through these systems of relations between individuals that societies are formed, sustained, and transformed over time.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

This diversification has led to job creation and increased productivity, which are essential for poverty reduction and economic development. However, it is important to note that while progress has been made, challenges such as inequality and exposure to global economic turbulence remain. This involves ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably, promoting inclusive development, and enacting policies that support substantive structural change. During the Reagan years, despite his claims of scaling back the welfare state and cutting tax rates, the economic well-being of Americans did not improve significantly. Income inequality actually increased during this time, and the rate of poverty at the end of Reagan's term remained the same as in 1980. One factor contributing to the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was the cutbacks in income transfers during the Reagan years. These cutbacks helped increase both poverty and inequality. However, changes in tax policy did have some impact on reducing poverty and increasing inequality. It's important to note that the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was not solely due to policy choices during the Reagan Administration. There were broader social and economic factors at play, such as widening income differences and challenges faced by families in staying out of poverty. Overall, while the standard of living improved to some extent during the Reagan years, there were persistent issues of income inequality and poverty that were not adequately addressed by the policy measures undertaken. ; decline of unions – Unions helped increase wages, benefits and working conditions. ; social norms – Social norms constrained executive pay. There have been two major changes in Social Security disability policy that have contributed to this phenomenon. Additionally, the 1996 welfare reform bill, which required states to reduce welfare numbers, may have provided an incentive for states to reclassify poor individuals as disabled to improve their welfare statistics. It is important to note that poverty and lack of education are also important determinants of who seeks disability, independent of illness status. Individuals with lower levels of education and those living in poverty are more likely to apply for and receive disability income. Overall, the combination of changes in disability policy, economic factors, and the increasing recognition of subjective symptoms has contributed to the rise in Americans applying for and receiving disability income in recent years. Another factor is the increasing flexibility of the labor market. This flexibility has led to changes in work conditions, including higher rates of unemployment, temporary jobs, and part-time contracts for both men and women. They often face higher rates of temporary employment and shorter contracts due to factors such as gender segregation in certain sectors. The rise in the female workforce has also played a role in shaping the dynamics of the productive sector. To address these issues and promote more inclusive work conditions, it is crucial to implement policies that support the reconciliation of labor and family life. This can involve measures aimed at equally distributing household responsibilities between men and women and providing increased access to social services for childcare and elder care.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

With the dawn of the Neolithic, drugs which require a longer time for production followed, mainly narcotic drugs such as alcohol and opium, but also cannabis. However, the use of psychiatric drugs to restore mental health, or at least limit aberrant behaviour, has only been widespread since the 1950s when a number of new classes of drugs were discovered, notably tranquillizers and antidepressants. Following their discovery some of these drugs gained popularity among psychiatrists and general practitioners. Barbiturates were used as hypnotics and as anxiolytics, but the development of the safer benzodiazepines (Lowell Randall and Leo Sternbach, 1957) in the 1960s and 1970s led to billions of doses being consumed annually under tradenames like Mogadon, Valium (diazepam, 1963) or Librium (chlordiazepoxide). Outside of the more popular drugs there was success in the treatment of some of the symptoms of psychosis and depression. It went beyond simple sedation, with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour, and over 100 million patients were treated. Such drugs had a revolutionary role in transforming mental institutions from an almost purely custodial role. But the limited knowledge of brain chemistry means that even more modern compounds cause a range of extrapyramidal side-effects and while effective at controlling acute symptoms are of less value in treating chronic symptoms. Enthusiasm for the first generation of anti-psychotic medications peaked in the late 1960s, but the image of the drugs plummeted in the mid-1970s, as studies emerged showing high rates of tardive dyskinesia, a typically permanent neurological disorder involving involuntary movements, in chronic users. LSD was promoted in the 1950s as a psychiatric cure-all, useful for treating schizophrenia, criminal behavior, sexual deviancy, alcoholism, and a wide variety of other mental ailments. Drug manufacturer Sandoz Laboratories suggested in its literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves, to gain a better subjective understanding of the schizophrenic experience. Many users have reported profound, life-transforming experiences as a result of taking LSD, while others have experienced intensely negative \"bad trips\", and a few have devolved into states of LSD psychosis. While scientific research into the effects and potential uses of LSD was common in the 1950s, it gradually declined as LSD became increasingly associated with spiritual experiences, recreational use, and hippies in the 1960s. Several researchers, most prominently erstwhile Harvard professor Dr. Timothy Leary, dissociated themselves from the mainstream mental health research establishment as its support for LSD research declined and transitioned to roles as spiritual gurus, advocating the use of LSD for personal spiritual growth. Potential theraputic uses of MDMA have been overshadowed by its popularity as a recreational drug and negative public perceptions fostered by anti-drug groups. The United States DEA's scheduling of MDMA as a Schedule 1 drug with no legitimate medical uses (some experts have recommended it be listed instead on Schedule 3, for drugs with potential medical applications) has severely hampered research. Improvements were made but the results were less marked than with anti-psychotic drugs. Soon musicians began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music, just as it was reflected in psychedelic art, literature and film. This trend ran in parallel in both America \n\n that catered to the population of students at nearby Berkeley and the free thinkers that had gravitated to the city. Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backwards tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment \n\n From the second half of the 1950s, Beat Generation writers like William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg wrote about and took drugs, including cannabis and Benzedrine, raising awareness and helping to popularise their use. In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other psychedelics was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler, and, according to Laurence Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

These newer methods are all based on systematic analysis rather than relying on tradition and rule of thumb. Other thinkers, even in Taylor's own time, also proposed considering the individual worker's needs, not just the needs of the process. Critics said that in Taylorism, \"the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the \n\n  Managerial finance is the branch of management that concerns itself with the managerial application of finance techniques and theory, emphasizing the financial aspects of managerial decisions; the assessment is per the managerial perspectives of planning, directing, and controlling. The techniques addressed are drawn in the main from managerial accounting and corporate finance: the former allow management to better understand, and hence act on, financial information relating to profitability and performance; the latter, as above, are about optimizing the overall financial structure, including its impact on working capital. When all businesses were small, almost all were managed by the proprietor. Management and business leadership as a profession arose during the industrial revolution with the advent of businesses much too large to be managed by a single entrepreneur. Frederick Winslow Taylor developed the scientific theory of management which he published in the journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1895. Scientific Management \n\n When the owner of a traditional business decides to resign and transition the ownership of the firm into a workers' cooperative, they often provide initial financial investment. However, this typically is not a sustainable form of capital investment and cooperatives often use it to begin business and then transition to depend on other forms of finance. Third, a transition group or the selling owner must organize the new managerial structure, business practices, and ownership policies.

Perhaps the most influential effort to compensate reproductive labor was the International Wages for Housework Campaign, an organization launched in Italy in \n\n subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay \"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex\", in which she coins the phrase \"sex/gender system\" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process. More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions as a result of gaining access to productive labor. Eisenstein defines the term 'capitalist patriarchy' as \"descriptive of the 'mutually reinforcing dialectical relationship between capitalist class structure and hierarchical sexual structuring.\" She believes: \"The recognition of women as a sexual class lays the subversive quality of feminism for liberalism because liberalism is premised upon women's exclusion from public life on this very class basis. Many Marxist feminist scholars, in the vein of an analyzing modes of oppression at the site of production, note the effect that housework has on women in a capitalist system. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Many of his proposals, like privatizating social services or making everyone hold a second job in the caring economy tending to the old, the young, the sick, the poor or the desperate (no, family members don't count), are ill thought-out. Still, he offers an incisive critique of social and economic discontents, one that turns traditional Marxist formulations on their heads (we... are, in large numbers, petty-bourgeois now.) This alternative would reshape production and politics, would refuse to see familiar forms of market economy, representative democracy and free civil society as necessary or canonical, would reject the contrast between market-oriented and command-economy solutions as a focus of ideological contests, would focus more on equality and inclusion within a setting of economic growth and technological innovation, than on increasing equality by redistribution through tax-and-transfer.

The left alternative offers a chance for European countries to reinvent and reinvigorate social democracy, which has gradually been stripped of programs that represented democracy's most ambitious hopes of fostering individual freedom, prosperity, and dignity. Unger sees this alternative as applicable across a broad range of richer and poorer societies, thus making possible a \"universalizing heresy\" that can oppose the universalizing orthodoxy promulgated by the rich Western countries on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Reasons cited for this controversy include the subjectivity of diagnosis, the use of diagnosis and treatment for social and political control including detaining citizens and treating them without consent, and the side effects of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics and historical procedures like lobotomy and other forms of psychosurgery or insulin shock therapy. There are a number of groups who are either critical towards psychiatry or entirely hostile to the field. Background Since the 1960s there have been challenges to the concept of mental illness. Sociologists Erving Goffman and Thomas Scheff said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; behavioural psychologists challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; gay rights activists criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 2013, Allen Frances said that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz, 1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \"psychotechnology\" (Chorover, 1973). Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.

Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or \n\n Labour's progressive social and cultural policies, which encouraged biculturalism and the growth of Māori culture, may have caused a backlash amongst working class Pakeha, who had traditionally supported Labour. This shift, along with the appeal the government's policies had for many middle class intellectuals, helped to change the culture of both parties, in Labour's case permanently. Under Muldoon, National had much more working class support than previously or since. The third Labour government's policies attracted a large university-educated liberal contingent to Labour, transforming the party from its working class, trade union roots. This shift in party culture explains how the fourth Labour government's policies differed so dramatically from those of its predecessors.

Some of the key features of society include its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. It involves the division of society into various social groups, such as families, communities, and social classes. Finally, institutions play a vital role in society. These are established systems or organizations that serve specific functions and fulfill collective needs. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. Institutions provide a framework for social interaction and governance, helping to maintain order and stability within society. In summary, society is characterized by its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. These characteristics intertwine to shape the fabric of society and influence the behavior and interactions of individuals within it. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the age of majority), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Sociology is a social science that focuses on society, human social behaviour, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life. While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Traditional focuses of sociology include \n\n  A social network is a social structure composed of individuals (or organizations) called \"nodes\", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from \n\nSociety can be understood as a complex web of relationships and interactions between individuals. It encompasses the collective organization of people who share common interests, values, and norms. It includes various social structures, institutions, and systems that shape human behavior and influence the way people live and interact with one another. Society also involves the establishment of social norms, which are shared expectations and behaviors that guide individuals' conduct and facilitate social order. These structures may include educational institutions, economic systems, religious organizations, political systems, and legal frameworks. They provide the framework through which individuals operate and contribute to the functioning of society as a whole. The study of society is a multidisciplinary field, drawing insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences to understand the complexity and dynamics of human interactions in a societal context. In summary, society encompasses the intricate network of relationships, social structures, institutions, and cultural factors that shape human behavior and interactions. It is through these systems of relations between individuals that societies are formed, sustained, and transformed over time.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

According to the study, employees who engage in surface acting at work tend to experience work-related exhaustion. This exhaustion acts as a mediating factor, meaning it partially explains the relationship between surface acting at work and at home. In other words, surface acting at work can drain employees' energetic resources, leading to increased levels of exhaustion. Furthermore, the study also found that surface acting at home can impact both the individual and their partner's satisfaction with the relationship. This relationship satisfaction is influenced by the individual's emotional energy, which is reduced as a result of surface acting at home. Recognizing the potential impact on employees' energetic resources and relationship satisfaction, organizations can work towards creating a supportive and authentic work environment that acknowledges and addresses employees' emotional needs. According to a study on mass-retail employees, proactive personality emerged as a protective factor against conflicts with clients, especially among employees experiencing high levels of emotional dissonance. They actively take steps to manage their emotions and engage in adaptive strategies to handle emotional demands effectively. In customer-facing roles, where there is a direct relationship with clients, emotional demands play a crucial role. Emotional dissonance, which refers to the internal experience of mismatched emotions, was found to be associated with more hostile customer relations. Identifying resources that enable the management of emotional demands is crucial in developing suitable adaptive strategies for individuals in customer-facing roles. found that expressions of positive mood by the leader improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.

They are required to establish a relationship of affectivity with their patients, providing not only physical care but also emotional support. To cope with the emotional challenges and fatigue associated with oncological care, healthcare professionals need to actively seek strategies that enable them to maintain their well-being. This may involve engaging in self-care practices, seeking support from colleagues or support groups, and regularly taking time off to rest and recharge. Additionally, organizations can play a vital role in promoting job satisfaction by implementing measures to support the emotional well-being of their employees, such as providing access to counseling services or organizing regular debriefing sessions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

In a society with high social mobility, individuals have a greater chance of moving up the social ladder, often through factors such as education, skill acquisition, and economic opportunities. On the other hand, low social mobility suggests that the chances of moving up or down the social scale are limited. For example, access to quality education plays a crucial role in upward social mobility as it equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to secure higher-paying jobs. Conversely, limited educational opportunities can hinder social mobility. Furthermore, income inequality can impact social mobility. Social barriers, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status, can also hinder social mobility. These barriers create systemic disadvantages for certain groups and limit their upward mobility. By addressing barriers and providing equal opportunities for education and economic advancement, societies can strive to increase social mobility and reduce disparities. It is a measure of the degree to which people can improve their social standing and access better opportunities in terms of education, income, and occupation. In societies with high levels of social mobility, individuals have a greater chance of upward mobility, meaning they can move from a lower socioeconomic status to a higher one. Social mobility can have a significant impact on equality and social justice within a society. Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies. Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the \n\nThe term commonly used to describe movement in socio-economic level is \"social mobility.\" Socio-economic mobility is an essential aspect of society as it reflects opportunities for advancement, equality, and the overall functioning of social systems. It can be influenced by various factors, including education, occupation, income, social networks, and structural factors like economic policies, discrimination, and social inequalities. By addressing barriers and improving opportunities for social mobility, societies can aim to create a more equitable and just environment for individuals to pursue their aspirations and improve their socio-economic status. One key factor that can influence social mobility is education. In some societies, there may be more rigid social structures and barriers to upward mobility, while in others, there may be a greater emphasis on meritocracy and equal opportunities. It is important to note that social mobility is a complex process influenced by a combination of factors. Addressing disparities in education, promoting economic equality, fostering social networks, and challenging barriers to upward mobility are some ways societies can work towards creating a more socially mobile environment for individuals.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Weber introduced the personality charisma sense when he applied charisma to designate a form of authority. One of the fundamental axioms of neoclassical economics, the law of diminishing marginal utility, followed from the highlighting of Weber-Fechner's law in psychophysics, which highlights that the growth of subjectively perceived intensity of recurrent stimuli with the same physical intensity is always decreasing. So, his \n\n Philosopher John Rawls accepted the reality of Weber's two kinds of rationality. In two works, A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, and Justice as Fairness, published in 2002, he claimed to have identified one such pattern, valued both for its intrinsic legitimacy and its instrumental efficiency. He relabeled social action “institutions” to identify rational patterns of socially prescribed behavior. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization. Weber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. For example, democratic systems \n\n take for granted.””  But he accepted the traditional proposition that instrumental rationality is incomplete because value-free. Weber's \"instrumental rationality\" and Rawls's \"the rational\" became actors' \"causally expected utility\"—satisfaction with workmanlike behavior—and \"evidentially expected utility\"—satisfaction with predicted utility after successful instrumental action. Weber's \"value rationality\" and Rawls's “the reasonable” became actors' \"symbolic utility\"—satisfaction with behavior that, in itself, symbolizes universal justice.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Depending on the tradition, these organizations may connect local churches to larger church traditions, ordain and defrock clergy, define terms of membership and exercise church discipline, and have organizations for cooperative ministry such as educational institutions and missionary societies. The word church may also be used for other religious communities, although for non-Christian communities the term is sometimes considered archaic or even offensive, while some other non-Christian communities themselves use the word to refer to their community or house of worship. In Catholic ecclesiology, a church is an assembly of the faithful, hierarchically ordered, both in the entire world (the Catholic Church), or in a certain territory (a particular church). More specifically, it is the local bishop, with his priests and deacons gathered around and assisting him in his office of teaching, sanctifying and governing (Mt.

That Theosophy should not be labeled a religion is a claim that has been maintained by Theosophical organizations, who instead regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \"essential truth\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. As a result, Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus. Scholars of religion who have studied Theosophy have characterized it as a religion. Established Christianity in the United States was experiencing challenges in the second half of the nineteenth century, a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, high rates of immigration, and the growing understanding of evolutionary theory which challenged traditional Christian accounts of history. Various new religious communities were established in different parts of the country, among them the Free Religious Association, New Thought, Christian Science, and Spiritualism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

About 186,000 free blacks and newly freed slaves fought for the Union in the Army and Navy, thereby validating their claims to full citizenship. The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a severe negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death. After liberation, many of the Freedmen remained on the same plantation. Others fled or crowded into refugee camps operated by the Freedmen's Bureau. The Bureau provided food, housing, clothing, medical care, church services, some schooling, legal support, and arranged for labor contracts. He did not personally manage the plantations, a task entrusted to (white) overseers. Being frequently absent, Quitman was unaware of slave resistance and did not plan for slave revolts. \"Neither he nor his family entertained second thoughts about the propriety or morality of their holding blacks in bondage.\" He \"genuinely believed that owner-slave relations were harmonious. ...The Quitmans lived to the very eve of the Civil War virtually oblivious of the dangers of slave rebellion and believing, as Quitman put it, that Southern society was 'based upon a more solid foundation' than Northern society.\" In the early stages of the American Civil War, the Union had no established policy on people escaping from slavery. Many enslaved people left their plantations heading for Union lines, but in the early stages of the war, fugitives from slavery were often returned by Union forces to their masters. He confiscated enslaved people as contraband of war and set them free, with the justification that the loss of labour would also damage the Confederacy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.
