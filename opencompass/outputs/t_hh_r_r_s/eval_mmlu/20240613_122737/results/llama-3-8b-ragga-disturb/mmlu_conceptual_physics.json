Distribution of Horizontal Component (X): As the size of the hopper opening (d) increases, the distribution function of the horizontal component (X) of the arch vector changes from a steplike function to a smooth function. This suggests that the horizontal displacement of the arch becomes more continuous and less discrete as the hopper opening size increases. Distribution of Vertical Component (Y): In contrast to the horizontal component, the distribution function of the vertical component (Y) of the arch vector remains symmetrical and peaked at Y=0 regardless of the hopper opening size. This means that the vertical displacement of the arch is centered around zero, indicating a balanced distribution of upward and downward movements. Mean Values of Components with Respect to n: The horizontal component (X(n)) and the absolute value of the vertical component (|Y(n)|) of the arch vector within each class (based on the number of disks) also exhibit increasing mean values with n. This suggests that as the arches become larger (with more disks), both the horizontal and vertical displacements tend to increase.

The physiological cross-sectional areas (CSAp) of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus intermedius (VI), vastus medialis (VM) and rectus femoris (RF) were obtained, in vivo, from the reconstructed muscle volumes, angles of pennation and distance between tendons of six healthy male volunteers by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MVC developed at the ankle was 746.0 (SD 141.8) N and its tendon component (Ft), given by a mechanical advantage of 0.117 (SD 0.010), was 6.367 (SD 1.113) kN. The stress of each muscle was obtained by dividing these forces for the respective CSAp which was: 6.24 x 10(-3) (SD 2.54 x 10(-3)) m2 for VL, 8.35 x 10(-3) (SD 1.17 x 10(-3)) m2 for VI, 6.80 x 10(-3) (SD 2.66 x 10(-3)) m2 for VM and 6.62 x 10(-3) (SD 1.21 x 10(-3)) m2 for RF. The mean value of stress of VL, VI, VM and RF was 250 (SD 19) kN m-2; this value is in good agreement with data on animal muscle and those on human parallel-fibred muscle.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g. Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy. Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. Again, unlike the effect that low-gravity environments have on weight, buoyancy does not make a portion of an object's weight vanish; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground, which leaves less force (weight) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question (though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition).

For instance, buoyancy's diminishing effect upon one's body weight (a relatively low-density object) is 1⁄860 that of gravity (for pure water it is about 1⁄770 that of gravity).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

This angle represents the threshold at which light rays entering the cornea from the air at a steeper angle will be reflected back into the cornea, rather than bending and continuing through the cornea. The latter ray would be undeviated if sufficiently far from the edge, but Young did not elaborate on that case. Later, in the 1803 Bakerian Lecture, Young ceased to regard inflection as a separate phenomenon, and produced evidence that diffraction fringes inside the shadow of a \n\n obstacle were due to interference: when the light from one side was blocked, the internal fringes disappeared. But Young was alone in such efforts until Fresnel entered the field. Huygens, in his investigation of double refraction, noticed something that he could not explain: when light passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence, the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second, while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second; but when the second crystal is rotated 90° about the incident rays, the \n\n had first to pump 90 litres of petroleum up to a tank at the top and then wind the weight up every two hours.

When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (like the cornea) to a medium with a lower refractive index (like air), it can undergo total internal reflection under certain conditions. When the angle of incidence of light hitting the cornea from the air exceeds 46 degrees, the light is completely reflected back into the cornea rather than being refracted out into the air. This knowledge helps explain phenomena such as the efficient transmission of light through the cornea and the functioning of various imaging techniques.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

In addition, flexible leaflets formed of polymeric, fiber-reinforced, and other synthetic materials have been proposed. Also, the leaflets are designed to fit within the support frame and expand outward in a valve open state without creating a shelf or belly that would restrict flow. The leaflet attachment edge in a relaxed state of the support frame circumscribes a flow volume having a central axis, the flow volume having a maximum flow orifice area perpendicular to the central axis limited by the inflow end of the support frame. A plurality of flexible leaflets attach to the support frame and extending inward toward the axis. Each leaflet has an arcuate cusp edge that conforms to a corresponding support frame cusp and attaches therealong between adjacent commissures, and a free edge that coapts with the free edges of the other leaflets to provide one way flow through the valve. Finally, each commissure of the relaxed support frame angles radially outward so as to provide an outflow orifice area greater than the maximum flow orifice area and induce laminar flow through the valve. The radially outward angle made by each commissure is preferably α=4±3°. A plurality of flexible leaflets attach to the support frame and extend inward toward the axis. Each leaflet has an arcuate cusp edge that conforms to a corresponding support frame cusp and attaches therealong between adjacent commissures, and a free edge that coapts with the free edges of the other leaflets to provide one way flow through the valve.

[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle θ is s⁄r radians.]] In order to measure an angle θ, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle. Conventionally, in mathematics and in the SI, the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless value 1. The angle expressed another angular \n\n In four-dimensional geometry, the rectified 5-cell is a uniform 4-polytope composed of 5 regular tetrahedral and 5 regular octahedral cells. Each edge has one tetrahedron and two octahedra. Each vertex has two tetrahedra and three octahedra. In total it has 30 triangle faces, 30 edges, and 10 vertices. Each vertex is surrounded by 3 octahedra and 2 tetrahedra; the vertex figure is a triangular prism. Topologically, under its highest symmetry, [3,3,3], there is only one geometrical form, containing 5 regular tetrahedra and 5 rectified tetrahedra (which is geometrically the same as a regular octahedron). It is also topologically identical to a tetrahedron-octahedron segmentochoron. Despite having the same number of vertices as cells (10) and the same number of edges as faces (30), the rectified 5-cell is not self-dual because the vertex figure (a uniform triangular prism) is not a dual of the polychoron's cells. In Euclidean geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. Angles formed by two rays lie in the plane that contains the rays. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes. These are called dihedral angles. Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection. Angle is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of a rotation. This measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation. The Reuleaux tetrahedron is the intersection of four balls of radius s centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron with side length s. The spherical surface of the ball centered on each vertex passes through the other three vertices, which also form vertices of the Reuleaux tetrahedron. Thus the center of each ball is on the surfaces of the other three balls. The Reuleaux tetrahedron has the same face structure as a regular tetrahedron, but with curved faces: four vertices, and four curved faces, connected by six circular-arc edges. This shape is defined and named by analogy to the Reuleaux triangle, a two-dimensional curve of constant width; both shapes are named after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German engineer who did pioneering work on ways that machines translate one type of motion into another. One can find repeated claims in the mathematical literature that the Reuleaux tetrahedron is analogously a surface of constant width, but it is not true: the two midpoints of opposite edge arcs are separated by a larger distance,\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

This entire area is still incompletely understood yet under intense research scrutiny. Faraday's law (1831) defines the fundamental relationship between a changing magnetic field and a conductor (any medium that carries electrically charged particles). When a wire is used as an example of a conductor, Faraday's law basically states that any change in the magnetic environment of the coil of wire with time will cause a voltage to be induced in the wire. No matter how the change is produced, a voltage will be generated.Lenz's law states that the polarity of the voltage induced according to Faraday's law is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the applied magnetic field (back EMF, or electromagnetic field).

The turns appear because when H is produced by a current-carrying \n\n Like all dynamos, the Faraday disc converts kinetic energy to electrical energy. This machine can be analysed using Faraday's own law of electromagnetic induction. This law, in its modern form, states that the full-time derivative of the magnetic flux through a closed circuit induces an electromotive force in the circuit, which in turn drives an electric current. The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced. Conversely, a changing external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to Faraday's law of induction. The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times. 1) the magnetic field B changes (e.g. spinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field), ; 4) any combination of the above  Faraday's law of induction makes use of the magnetic flux ΦB through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Therefore, when the frequency of light increases, the energy of the corresponding photon also increases. This relationship can be explained using the equation E = hν, where E represents the energy of a photon and h is Planck's constant. According to this equation, the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. Consequently, higher frequency light (e.g., blue or violet light) carries photons with greater energy, while lower frequency light (e.g., red or infrared light) carries photons with lesser energy. For instance, violet light with a wavelength of around 400 nm has a higher frequency compared to red light with a wavelength of about 680 nm. As a result, the photons in violet light possess higher energy than those in red light. At 400 nm (violet light), the energy of a mole of photons can be computed using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s), c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength in meters. By performing this calculation, you will find the energy of a mole of photons at 400 nm. In summary, the frequency of light directly determines the energy of a photon. An increase in frequency leads to higher energy photons, while a decrease in frequency results in lower energy photons. This relationship is described by the equation E = hν, where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of light. However, because short-wavelength photons carry more energy per photon, the maximum amount of photosynthesis per incident unit of energy is at a longer wavelength, around 650 nm (deep red). The results were optically visible, where the BIPS in gels turned from a colorless appearance to a brown or pink color after repeatedly being exposed to a high energy UV pump beam. High energy photons cause a transformation in the BIPS molecule making the molecule change its structure. The excited state originates from the interaction between a photon and the quantum system. Photons carry energy that is determined by the wavelengths of the light that carries the photons. On the other hand, a lower efficiency means that a significant portion of absorbed light energy may be dissipated as heat or lost as fluorescence, resulting in reduced ATP and NADPH production. Each photon carries an amount of energy given by the equation E = hv, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant (6.6 × 10^(-37) kJ sec/photon), and v is the frequency in sec^(-1). To exemplify, assuming monochromatic light of wavelength 680 nm, the energy of a mole of photons can be calculated. Higher efficiency allows for a greater conversion of light energy into chemical energy, leading to increased production of ATP and NADPH, whereas lower efficiency results in a lower yield of these energy-rich molecules.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. On the other hand, general relativity, presented by Einstein in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational forces. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It is important to note that while \"relativity\" primarily refers to these two theories by Einstein, there is also Galilean relativity, which predates them. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. References:\n- The theory of relativity , or simply relativity, refers specifically to two theories of Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. - John Archibald Wheeler Also, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences. Note how the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates, changing the instantaneous inertial frame of reference. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

This circuit allows the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode, completing the electrical circuit. This isolation is used to protect against electric shock, to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected.

Inner shell fluorescence: Inner shell fluorescence occurs when high-energy X-rays or electrons ionize the inner shells of atoms, causing the outer-shell electrons to transition to lower energy levels. These transitions result in the emission of characteristic X-ray lines. The relative importance of these processes and their contribution to the overall emission in NGC 1068's X-ray spectrum depend on the conditions present in the gas. As with all ionized gases, xenon flashtubes emit light in various spectral lines. The spectrum emitted by flashtubes is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type.

After Bohr's use of Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the emission and absorption spectra of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. Every chemical element has absorption lines at particular wavelengths, which correspond to the differences between the energy levels of its atomic orbitals. When light passes through a gas or liquid containing these elements, certain wavelengths are absorbed, resulting in dark lines or bands in the spectrum. By comparing these absorption lines with known patterns for different elements, scientists can determine which elements are present in a star or gaseous object.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

It is said that surface tension (and viscosity) are significant for waves up to about 7 cm in wavelength. Therefore, the characteristics of wind waves are determined by the coupling processes between the boundary layers of both the atmosphere and ocean. A proper description of the physical mechanisms that cause the growth of wind waves and is in accordance with observations has yet to be completed. A necessary condition for wind waves to grow is a minimum wind speed of 0.05 m/s. As a result, the momentum flux (the rate of momentum transfer per unit area and unit time) generates a current. These surface currents are able to transport energy (e.g. The different processes described here are depicted in the sketches shown in figures 1.1 till 1.4. Interactions between wind, wind waves and currents are an essential part of the world ocean dynamics. Eventually, the wind waves also influence the wind field leading to a complex interaction between wind and water whereof the research for \n\nA waveform is a graphic representation of a wave, typically plotted against time. It is a visual depiction of the characteristic wave that shows how the wave changes over time. The waveform can have several characteristics, including amplitude, frequency, wavelength, and phase. Amplitude refers to the maximum displacement or height of the wave. It represents the strength or intensity of the wave. In a waveform, the amplitude is represented along the vertical axis. Frequency refers to the number of complete cycles of the wave that occur in a given time period. It is measured in hertz (Hz) and represents the rate at which the wave oscillates. In a waveform, the wavelength can be seen as the distance between repeating patterns. Phase is often represented in degrees or radians. Graphically, these characteristics are represented by plotting the waveform on a graph. The waveform is drawn by connecting points that correspond to the value of the wave at specific points in time. By analyzing the shape of the waveform, we can derive valuable information about the characteristics of the wave, such as its frequency, amplitude, and phase.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Lung shielding is facilitated to reduce the risk of pulmonary toxicity. Eight arc fields and five additional fixed beams are applied to the patient in supine and prone position respectively. The dose distributions were measured in a solid water phantom and in an Alderson phantom. From 1995 to 2013 at our department different schemes have been applied using a sweeping beam technique as described by Müller . Lung shielding should be facilitated to reduce the pulmonary toxicity [2, 11] as it was possible with the former technique. Abandoning of the gravity oriented accessory was a precondition to enable the calculation of the dose distribution with a commercial RTPS in clinical routine . Although the application of a commercial RTPS is still quite uncommon in TBI with Linacs, as the technical conditions cannot be modelled for many of the applied techniques, single cases have been reported earlier [12–15]. Two linacs of type Elekta Synergy™ with Agility™ head (Elekta Ltd., Crawley, UK) and photon energies of 6 and 15 MV and electron energies of 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 MeV were used for this study. The photon beam energy chosen for TBI is 6 MV as rather common . For the compensation of the effects of inverse square variation of the fluence with distance, additional fields are required in the cranial and caudal direction, partially with wedge, the toe directed to the more distant areas. The parameters of these distance compensating fields are given in Table 1. The electron applicator 25 × 25 cm2 is equipped with individually shaped apertures and is applied in source skin distance of 110 cm. A solid phantom of water equivalent material (RW3, PTW Freiburg, Germany) was composed of slabs of 1 cm to cuboids of 30 cm width, 90 cm length, and 11–29 cm height, thus fulfilling minimum dimension requirements [20, 21]. Measurements in the phantom were performed using a Unidos dosimeter (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) with an ionization chamber (IC) M23332, a Roos chamber and Gafchromic™ EBT3 films (Ashland Inc., Covington, KY, USA). For in-vivo dosimetry a set of diode detectors (Isorad-p 6-12 MV, Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA), suitable for TBI dosimetry , in combination with a Multidos electrometer and Multisoft software (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) has been calibrated against the Unidos dosimeter in the phantom of 21 cm of RW3 material in the TBI irradiation geometry. Although calculations on the supine study neglect changes in the body geometry induced by the prone positioning, it is more descriptive to have the complete calculations in one study. The MU are adjusted for the actually delivered eight arcs. To overcome this restriction, the patient outline\n\n As another example from physics, consider a parallel-plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another. One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the \"charge\" of a gas in a cylinder, with the resulting mechanical force exerted on a piston. To find the force, compute the potential energy, and then apply the definition of force as the gradient of the potential energy function. The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C(x) and charge Q is  The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now Q is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same \"pull\" between a capacitor's plates. from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging. This ambiguity in the anode and cathode designation causes confusion in battery engineering, as is necessary to have the anode and cathode associated with unique physical components. The common convention is to name the electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge as the anode or the negative (-) electrode and the electrode that absorbs the electrons as the cathode or the positive (+). electrode. Naming the physical electrodes as positive (+) or negative \n\n The typical example is of the two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum, placed a few nanometers apart. In a classical description, the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them. When this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons which constitute the field, and generate a net force – either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a \n\nThe classical Gouy-Chapman theory, which assumes a uniform dielectric constant in the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, cannot accurately calculate the double-layer interactions between two plates with hairy surfaces. This theory only considers the steric effect, which is a short-range interaction that occurs when the chains on different particles interpenetrate each other. However, in the case of colloidal particles with hairy surfaces, the extended chains constrain the orientation of water molecules near the surface, resulting in a difference in the dielectric constant compared to the bulk. This difference in dielectric constant affects the distributions of ion concentrations and the gradient of the electric field. To account for this limitation, a model that considers the difference in dielectric constants in the hairy region and outside that region is proposed. In summary, the limitations of using the classical Gouy-Chapman theory in calculating double-layer interactions between two plates with hairy surfaces stem from its inability to account for the non-uniform dielectric constant caused by the extended chains and the ion specificity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

About 26% of the incoming solar energy is reflected back to space by the atmosphere and clouds, and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and warms it. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the \n\n Earth constantly absorbs energy from sunlight and emits thermal radiation as infrared light. In the long run, Earth radiates the same amount of energy per second as it absorbs, because the amount of thermal radiation emitted depends upon temperature: If Earth absorbs more energy per second than it radiates, Earth heats up and the thermal radiation will increase, until balance is restored; if Earth absorbs less energy than it radiates, it cools down and the thermal radiation will decrease, again until balance is restored. Atmospheric CO2 absorbs some of the energy radiated by the ground, but it emits itself thermal radiation: For example, in some wavelengths \n\n Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds. Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments on board the Terra and \n\nThe greenhouse effect refers to the process in which the atmosphere of a planet, including Earth, traps and re-emits infrared radiation, resulting in the warming of the planet's surface. To understand how the greenhouse effect impacts Earth's average surface temperature, it is important to consider its absence. However, due to the presence of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), the average surface temperature is about 14 °C (57 °F). These greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth, allowing sunlight to pass through but trapping some of the heat radiated from the surface. However, human activities have led to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This enhanced greenhouse effect has contributed to global warming, which is characterized by a recent increase in Earth's lower atmospheric temperatures. In addition to Earth, other planets like Mars and Venus also experience their own versions of the greenhouse effect. However, their atmospheres differ significantly from ours due to variations in composition and concentration of gases.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

According to Ohm's law, the voltage (V) across a resistor is equal to the current (I) flowing through it multiplied by its resistance (R). The slope of this line (ΔV/ΔI) represents the input resistance of the cell (Rin). This relationship aligns with Ohm's law for current flowing through a resistor, where the input resistance determines the extent of membrane potential change in response to the current. In an electric circuit, the relationship between voltage, current, resistance, and power is governed by Ohm's Law. According to Ohm's Law, voltage (V) is equal to the current (I) multiplied by the resistance (R). It represents the amount of force or pressure that pushes the electric charge through the circuit. It is the rate at which electrons pass through a specific point in a circuit. It determines how much current will flow in a circuit for a given voltage. Higher resistance restricts the flow of electrons, while lower resistance allows more current to flow. Power, measured in watts (W), represents the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or produced in a circuit. Therefore, in summary, the relationship between voltage, current, resistance, and power in an electric circuit is described by Ohm's Law, which states that voltage is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance. width4 = 187  The resistance between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (I–V) curve (characteristic curve), giving the current }}\n\n Resistors above about 1 ohm in value can be measured using a variety of techniques, such as an ohmmeter or by using a Wheatstone bridge. To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. To measure such resistances requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances.

A catch-up period with a supraphysiological growth velocity generally occurs during the first 6 to 24 months of life in 80 to 90 percent (%) of these children. That means that conversely, approximately 10 to 20% of children do maintain a statural handicap. Final height was defined as the height reached 1 year after height velocity (HV) was less than 2 centimeter/year (cm/year). Height velocity was the change in height since the previous year's measurement. Height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer (or in supine position if the participant's age was less than 3 years) and the measurement was repeated thrice by the same observer. PAHSDS is the distance between the participant's current and target heights, expressed in units of SD of the height distribution of the reference population. Target height standard deviation score (THSDS) was calculated as target height minus mean adult height of the reference population divided by SD of the mean adult height of the reference population.

The term volcanic ash is also often loosely used to refer to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2 mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions, and may also be formed during transport in pyroclastic density currents. Characteristics can be sorted to infer subaqueous eruption or emplacement of silicic pyroclastic deposits. Larger pumice blocks rise for a more extended period of time (minutes to hours) in comparison to smaller pumice fragments because of gases trapped within vesicles and the very fine ash fragments may become entrained into the rising plume of gas and heated water because of the low density and weight. Therefore, subaqueous silicic pyroclastic eruptions may be diminished in the course size fraction as well as the very fine \n\n magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Pyroclastic density currents can also produce ash particles. Within pyroclastic density currents particle abrasion occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within \n\n ocean in pumice rafts. This, combined with the above three other main impacts make sailing in the vicinity of volcanic ash very dangerous for mariners.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

However, a neural mechanism must also exist for the analysis of color brightness because the amount of light absorbed by a visual pigment, as well as the subsequent response of the cell, depends on both the wavelength and the intensity of the light (see\n\nFig. The presence of three kinds decreases the ambiguity in distinguishing colors when all three absorb light, and it ensures that at least two types of cones will absorb most wavelengths of visible light. Green and red are opposed, as are yellow and blue, as well as black and white. Furthermore, a greenish red or a bluish yellow color does not exist.Similarly, neurons excited by blue wavelengths may be inhibited by yellow wavelengths.Neurons with these characteristics are present both in the retina and at higher levels of the visual pathway and seem to serve to increase the ability to see the contrast between opposing colors.A diagram of the basic circuitry of the retina is shown in\n\nFig.8.7 . Red is the color most commonly associated with love, followed at a great distance by pink. It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose, is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine's Day. Both the Greeks and the Hebrews considered red a symbol of love as well as sacrifice. The Roman de la Rose, the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers – giving a single red rose meant \n\n Subtractive coloring uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or \"subtracted\" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye. If the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object. The visual pigments in the cone outer segments contain different opsins, which allow them to absorb light at different wavelengths. The three types of cones have maximum absorption efficiency closer to violet, green, and yellow wavelengths, although they are referred to as blue, green, and red pigments, respectively. For example, if the cones that respond to red and green light are stimulated at the same time, our brain interprets it as yellow. Similarly, a mixture of red and blue light is interpreted as magenta. It's important to note that the amount of light absorbed by each cone and the subsequent response of the cell depend on both the wavelength and the intensity of the light.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Neurons sensitive to interaural level differences (ILDs) are excited by stimulation of one ear and inhibited by stimulation of the other ear, such that the response magnitude of the cell depends on the relative strengths of the two inputs, which in turn, depends on the sound intensities at the ears. However, no such time or level differences exist for sounds originating along the circumference of circular conical slices, where the cone's axis lies along the line between the two ears. Consequently, sound waves originating at any point along a given circumference slant height will have ambiguous perceptual coordinates. Of course, the importance of these ambiguities are vanishingly small for sound sources very close to or very far away from the subject, but it is these intermediate distances that are most important in terms of fitness. These ambiguities can be removed by tilting the head, which can introduce a shift in both the amplitude and phase of sound waves arriving at each ear. As with other sensory stimuli, perceptual disambiguation is also accomplished through integration of multiple sensory inputs, especially visual cues. Moreover, prior knowledge of the location of the sound generating agent will assist in resolving its current location. In this section, to more deeply understand the human auditory mechanism, we will briefly discuss about human ear localization theory. The azimuth of a sound is signaled by the difference in arrival times between the ears, by the relative amplitude of high-frequency sounds (the shadow effect), and by the asymmetrical spectral reflections from various parts of our bodies, including torso, shoulders, and pinnae. The distance cues are the loss of amplitude, the loss of high frequencies, and the ratio of the direct signal to the reverberated signal. Lower frequencies, with longer wavelengths, diffract the sound around the head forcing the brain to focus only on the phasing cues from the source. As shown in the duplex theory figure, since the distances between the acoustic source and ears are different, there are time difference and intensity difference between the sound signals of two ears. We call those kinds of differences as Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) respectively. Simultaneously, human head and ears may have a shadowing effect on high-frequency signals, which will generate IID. Interaural time difference (ITD) – Sound from the right side reaches the right ear earlier than the left ear. The auditory system evaluates interaural time differences from: (a) Phase delays at low frequencies and (b) group delays at high frequencies. Theory and experiments show that ITD relates to the signal frequency f. Suppose the angular position of the acoustic source is θ, the head radius is r and the acoustic velocity is c, the function of ITD is given by:. Interaural intensity difference (IID) or interaural level difference (ILD) – Sound from the right side has a higher level at the right ear than at the left ear, because the head shadows the left ear. These level differences are highly frequency dependent and they increase with increasing frequency. The function of IID is given by: For frequencies below 1000 Hz, mainly ITDs are evaluated (phase delays), for frequencies above 1500 Hz mainly IIDs are evaluated. Between 1000 Hz and 1500\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity the wave travels at in the medium depends on the acoustic properties of the medium, which include its density, elasticity, and compressibility.The energy loss heats the medium.As the magnitude of the wave decreases, the energy is absorbed by the medium.16.1, the sound frequency is shown by the oscillating wave.As shown in Fig.High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) procedures are used to treat cancer patients. Sound is mechanical energy that travels as pressure waves through a medium. That is, the pressure increase and decrease during each ultrasound wave cycle. This is above audible sound that has frequencies of 2–20,000 Hz. As shown in Fig. The magnitude of the velocity the wave travels at in the medium depends on the acoustic properties of the medium, which include its density, elasticity, and compressibility.This is important because ultrasound frequencies can travel reasonable distances in tissue and water, but do not penetrate lung or air cavities.The sound frequency is transmitted in packets, as shown in Fig.16.2.The frequency of the packets is called the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). **Figure 16.1** A sound wave as it interacts with a medium.Notice the magnitude decreases with depth. high enough) not to slow the gas below Mach1. If the gas within a scramjet goes below Mach1 the engine will \"choke\", transitioning to subsonic flow in the combustion chamber. This effect is well known amongst experimenters on scramjets since the waves caused by choking are easily observable. Additionally, the sudden increase in pressure and temperature in the engine can lead to an acceleration of the combustion, leading to the combustion chamber exploding. Second, the heating of the gas by combustion causes the speed of sound in the gas to increase (and the Mach number to decrease) even though the gas is still travelling at the same \n\n At one particular speed resonance will occur between the motion of the man and the plank and the ends of the plank then oscillate with large amplitude. ; When using a microwave oven to cook food, the micro wave travels through the food, causing the water molecules vibrate in the same frequency, which is similar to resonance, so that the food as a whole, gets hot fast. ; Some of the helicopter crashes are caused by resonance too. The eyeballs of the pilot resonate because of excessive pressure in the upper air, making the pilot unable to see overhead power lines. ; Resonance of two identical tune forks See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCocQa2Bcuc\n\nSound localization is a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance. Some cells are more directly connected to one ear than the other, thus they are specific for a particular interaural time difference. Neurons sensitive to interaural level differences (ILDs) are excited by stimulation of one ear and inhibited by stimulation of the other ear, such that the response magnitude of the cell depends on the relative strengths of the two inputs, which in turn, depends on the sound intensities at the ears. However, no such time or level differences exist for sounds originating along the circumference of circular conical slices, where the cone's axis lies along the line between the two ears. Consequently, sound waves originating at any point along a given circumference slant height will have ambiguous perceptual coordinates. Of course, the importance of these ambiguities are vanishingly small for sound sources very close to or very far away from the subject, but it is these intermediate distances that are most important in terms of fitness. These ambiguities can be removed by tilting the head, which can introduce a shift in both the amplitude and phase of sound waves arriving at each ear. As with other sensory stimuli, perceptual disambiguation is also accomplished through integration of multiple sensory inputs, especially visual cues. Moreover, prior knowledge of the location of the sound generating agent will assist in resolving its current location. In this section, to more deeply understand the human auditory mechanism, we will briefly discuss about human ear localization theory. The azimuth of a sound is signaled by the difference in arrival times between the ears, by the relative amplitude of high-frequency sounds (the shadow effect), and by the asymmetrical spectral reflections from various parts of our bodies, including torso, shoulders, and pinnae. The distance cues are the loss of amplitude, the loss of high frequencies, and the ratio of the direct signal to the reverberated signal. Lower frequencies, with longer wavelengths, diffract the sound around the head forcing the brain to focus only on the phasing cues from the source. As shown in the duplex theory figure, since the distances between the acoustic source and ears are different, there are time difference and intensity difference between the sound signals of two ears. We call those kinds of differences as Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) respectively.

How does emphysema affect the respiratory system? In people with emphysema, the lung tissue involved in exchange of gases is impaired or destroyed. Emphysema changes the anatomy of the lung in several important ways. How do bronchitis emphysema and lung cancer affect the respiratory system? Answer: Minute ventilation represents the sum ofexhaled tidal volumes over a period of one minute. Whats the name for respiratory gas volume that allows gas exchange to go on continuously? Why volume of water exerts greater pressure than volume of air? Answer: DENSER MORE PRESSURE PRESSURE PRESSURE LOOK AT SCIENCE TEXT BOOK DONT CHEAT ON WIKIWater has more density than air. What can I do to increase the volume? Answer: Volume in math means the amount of space an object occupies.Volume in music means amplitude, loudness, or sound pressure.Scroll down to related links and look at \"How many decibels (dB) is twice (double, half) or three times as loud?\". The victims lungs are expanded and it fills the chest before full volume of air can be inhaled. When the victim exhales, he is not able to fully do so because of the higher residual volume in his lungs. Which respiratory ailments can respiratory volume tests be used to detect? Which respiratory ailments can respiratory volume test be used to detect? How does emphysema affect tidal volume? Does emphysema increase residual air volume? RV increases due to flow limitation that causes air trapping. Answer: An increase in pressure, a decrease in temperature, and a decrease in the number of moles of gas could all cause a decrease in volume of a gas. What does emphysema do to your respiratory system? Which respiratory air volumes does emphysema affect? Temperature, blood pH, the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, and other local chemical changes all affect the shape of hemoglobin and therefore influence hemoglobin saturation.This is called the **venous reserve** —and it means that under conditions of exercise, when much more oxygen is used, more can be unloaded in the capillaries even before any increase in breathing.Placement of the lungs within the chest\n\n**Residual volume** is what your body will rely on if you've ever been completely winded—it's very difficult to take your first breath afterwards, rather like blowing up a completely empty balloon. Residual volume prevents us from having to inflate a completely empty balloon with every breath! That first breath we each take as a newborn is as hard as this—we have to blow up the lung balloons for the first time. (Consider the barbarity of holding up a newborn human and smacking it to make it cry and take its first breath? **Inspiratory reserve volume** allows us to inhale well beyond our tidal volumes, so we can take in extra air for swimming or other demanding movements. ## Transport of Respiratory Gases by Blood\n\n**Oxygen** is carried bound to hemoglobin in the red blood cells with an additional small amount being dissolved in the plasma. On opening the bottle to atmospheric pressure,  solubility decreases and the gas bubbles are released from the liquid. ; For climbers or people living at high altitude: Concentration of in the blood and tissues is so low that they feel weak and are unable to think properly, a condition called hypoxia. ; In underwater diving: Gas is breathed at the ambient pressure which increases with depth due to the hydrostatic pressure. To avoid this injury the diver must ascend slow enough that the excess dissolved gas is carried away by the blood and released into the lung gas. is required to counter their weight when they are hovering over the ground (when they can often be within one hundred newtons of zero weight), the inertia associated with their appreciable mass of several hundred kilograms or more can knock fully grown men off their feet when the balloon's basket is moving horizontally over the ground. Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. In other words, if the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure will increase, and vice versa. This relationship can be explained by considering the behavior of gas molecules in a closed system. This increased force per unit area is what we perceive as an increase in pressure. Conversely, when the volume of the system increases, there is more space for the gas molecules to spread out. They collide with each other and with the walls of the container less frequently, resulting in a lower force per unit area and therefore a decrease in pressure. Understanding Boyle's law is important in various fields such as medicine because it helps explain phenomena like breathing. When we inhale (increase lung volume), air pressure inside our lungs decreases compared to atmospheric pressure outside. Conversely, when we exhale (decrease lung volume), air pressure inside our lungs increases compared to atmospheric pressure outside, leading to airflow outwards. It provides valuable insights into various natural processes involving gases and has practical applications in fields like medicine.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Birefringence refers to the property of a material to have different refractive indices for different polarization states of light. This effect allows for the manipulation and control of light propagation in the metamaterial. Understanding and mitigating these effects are important for optimizing the performance and stability of the chiral metamaterial. the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated \n\n an analyzer with the appropriate orientation. Light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization (e.g., by passage through a crystal lamina, or by total internal reflection) was described as partly or fully \"depolarized\" because of its behavior in an analyzer. After Fresnel, the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of amplitudes and a fixed difference in phase. By that definition, elliptically or circularly polarized light is fully polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone. In a memoir dated 9 December 1822, Fresnel coined the terms linear polarization (French: polarisation rectiligne) for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180° out of phase, circular polarization for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter-cycle (±90°) out of phase, and elliptical polarization for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference. If these \n\n [[Image:Waveplate.png|thumb|300px| Linearly polarized light entering a half-wave plate can be resolved into two waves, parallel and perpendicular to the optic axis of the waveplate.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.
