Most of these viruses are very common and typically asymptomatic in most human populations studied. Structure and genome Polyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with circular genomes of around 5000 base pairs. The capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres of a protein called VP1, which is capable of self-assembly into a closed icosahedron; each pentamer of VP1 is associated with one molecule of one of the other two capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3. The genome of a typical polyomavirus codes for between 5 and 9 proteins, divided into two transcriptional regions called the early and late regions due to the time during infection in which they are transcribed. Each region is transcribed by the host cell's RNA polymerase II as a single pre-messenger RNA containing multiple genes. Additional genes and other variations on this theme are present in some viruses: for example, rodent polyomaviruses have a third protein called middle tumor antigen in the early region, which is extremely efficient at inducing cellular transformation; SV40 has an additional capsid protein VP4; some examples have an additional regulatory protein called agnoprotein expressed from the late region. Cellular receptors for polyomaviruses are sialic acid residues of glycans, commonly gangliosides. The attachment of polyomaviruses to host cells is mediated by the binding of VP1 to sialylated glycans on the cell surface. In some particular viruses, additional cell-surface interactions occur; for example, the JC virus is believed to require interaction with the 5HT2A receptor and the Merkel cell virus with heparan sulfate. However, in general virus-cell interactions are mediated by commonly occurring molecules on the cell surface, and therefore are likely not a major contributor to individual viruses' observed cell-type tropism. The details of transit to the nucleus are not clear and may vary among individual polyomaviruses. It has been frequently reported that an intact, albeit distorted, virion particle is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell cytoplasm, where the genome is released from the capsid, possibly due to the low calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. The precise mechanism of this dysregulation depends on the virus; for example, SV40 LT can directly bind host cell p53, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. As these interactions begin, the LTs belonging to several polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, present oncogenic potential. Taxonomy The polyomaviruses are members of group I (dsDNA viruses). Formerly, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, which share many structural features but have very different genomic organizations, were classified together in the now-obsolete family Papovaviridae. (The name Papovaviridae derived from three abbreviations: Pa for Papillomavirus, Po for Polyomavirus, and Va for \"vacuolating.\") The polyomaviruses were divided into three major clades (that is, genetically-related groups): the SV40 clade, the avian clade, and the murine polyomavirus clade. A subsequent proposed reclassification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recommended dividing the family of Polyomaviridae into three genera: Genus Orthopolyomavirus (type species SV40) Genus Wukipolyomavirus (type species KI polyomavirus) Genus Avipolyomavirus (type species Avian polyomavirus) The current ICTV classification system recognises six genera and 117 species, of which five could not be assigned a genus. This system retains the distinction between avian and mammalian viruses, grouping the avian subset into the genus Gammapolyomavirus. The six genera are: Alphapolyomavirus Betapolyomavirus Deltapolyomavirus Epsilonpolyomavirus Gammapolyomavirus Zetapolyomavirus The following species are unassigned to a genus: Centropristis striata polyomavirus 1 Rhynchobatus djiddensis polyomavirus 1 Sparus aurata polyomavirus 1 Trematomus bernacchii polyomavirus 1 Trematomus pennellii polyomavirus 1 Description of additional viruses is ongoing.

All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. AIDS epidemic The length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. The law provided exemptions and waivers for applications from small businesses, drugs aimed at orphan diseases, or unmet public health needs. PDUFA II In its 1997 reauthorization of PDUFA, Congress enacted stricter performance goals, required increased transparency in the drug review process, and tried to facilitate better communication between drug makers and patient advocacy groups. When Congress was debating the legislation that implemented PDUFA II Rep. Billy Tauzin, who later became head of PhRMA and one of those leading the call for a further streamlined review process, told a story of how a family friend had to travel to Mexico to obtain drugs that helped him overcome prostate cancer. In testimony before Congress, James Swire, an AIDS activist and health educator who became infected with HIV in 1990, said the FDA has dramatically reduced the time needed to approve life-saving drugs using the money from PDUFA. Swire said, \"I'm here because people really pushed the review process for AIDS and HIV treatments. There still is not a cure, but because of some of the new drugs, a lot of us have been able to get back to work.\" In February 2007 the FDA exempted drugs used in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from user fees in order to reduce the financial burden of developing new AIDS drugs.

AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. PDUFA gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a revenue source, fees paid by pharmaceutical companies seeking the approval of new drugs, to supplement but not replace direct appropriations from Congress. The law provided exemptions and waivers for applications from small businesses, drugs aimed at orphan diseases, or unmet public health needs. PDUFA II In its 1997 reauthorization of PDUFA, Congress enacted stricter performance goals, required increased transparency in the drug review process, and tried to facilitate better communication between drug makers and patient advocacy groups. When Congress was debating the legislation that implemented PDUFA II Rep. Billy Tauzin, who later became head of PhRMA and one of those leading the call for a further streamlined review process, told a story of how a family friend had to travel to Mexico to obtain drugs that helped him overcome prostate cancer. In testimony before Congress, James Swire, an AIDS activist and health educator who became infected with HIV in 1990, said the FDA has dramatically reduced the time needed to approve life-saving drugs using the money from PDUFA. Swire said, \"I'm here because people really pushed the review process for AIDS and HIV treatments. There still is not a cure, but because of some of the new drugs, a lot of us have been able to get back to work.\" In February 2007 the FDA exempted drugs used in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from user fees in order to reduce the financial burden of developing new AIDS drugs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Malaria: Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted through mosquito bites. It leads to major health problems and claims at least a million lives every year. TB claimed approximately 1.4 million lives in 2011. Prevention involves vaccinating infants at high risk and ensuring appropriate treatment to control and prevent the spread of the disease. Lower Respiratory Infections: This category includes pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. Proper hygiene practices, vaccination against pneumonia, and prompt treatment can reduce the mortality rate due to these infections. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Prevention involves controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking, as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle. It is primarily caused by smoking and exposure to pollutants. Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It contributes to millions of deaths annually. Public awareness campaigns, strict enforcement of traffic laws, improving road infrastructure, and advocating safe driving practices are essential to minimize the impact of road traffic injuries. While each of these diseases requires a multifaceted approach, education, public health practices, prevention, and appropriate treatment play crucial roles in minimizing their impact and preventing unnecessary deaths. Preterm birth complications (18%) ; Leading cause of child mortality.jpgonia (16%) ; Interpartum-related events (12%) ; Neonatal sepsis (7%) ; Diarrhea (8%) ; Malaria (5%) ; Malnutrition and Under nutrition The leading causes of death of children under five include:  There is variation of child mortality around the world. Countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode (DTM) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth stage. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa, with Somalia having the highest under-5 mortality rates. 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and \n\n This is close to the global average of 32,796.89 DALYs lost. Disease burden by cause Dividing the diseases in three common groups of communicable diseases, non- communicable disease (NCD) and injuries (also includes violence, suicides, etc. ), a large shift from communicable disease to NCDs can be seen from 1990 to 2017. NCDs has a share of 58.67% of total DALYs lost in 2017 which was only 22.53% in 1990 (refer fig 2) Below is the table showing how the causes of DALYs lost has changed from 1990 to 2019 According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, the eight leading causes of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) in Nepal are: Neonatal disorders (9.97%), Ischaemic Heart Disease (7.55%), COPD (5.35%), Lower respiratory infection (5.15%), \n\nis instructive to look to HIV/AIDS, which in the course of the last three decades has become the world’s leading infectious cause of adult death.Data available through www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/gbd/visualizations/country.Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington (2013).Abbreviation: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.taBLe 2-2 LeadInG Causes of death WorLdWIde, 2010\n\nDeaths Percent of\n\nDeaths Percent of Disease or Injury (Millions) Total Deaths Disease or Injury (Millions) Total Deaths 1 Ischemic heart disease 7.3 13.3 2 Cerebrovascular disease 5.9 11.1 3 COPD 2.9 5.5 4 Lower respiratory infections 2.8 5.3 5 Lung cancer 1.5 2.9 6 HIV/AIDS 1.5 2.8 7 Diarrheal diseases 1.4 2.7 8 Road injury 1.3 2.5 9 Diabetes 1.3 2.4 10 Tuberculosis 1.2 2.3 1 Cerebrovascular disease 4.2 10.5 2 Ischemic heart disease 4.0 10.1 3 COPD 2.4 6.1 4 Lower respiratory infections 2.3 5.9 5 Diarrheal diseases 1.4 3.6 6 HIV/AIDS 1.4 3.4 7 Malaria 1.2 2.9 8 Road injury 1.2 2.9 9 Tuberculosis 1.1 2.9 10 Diabetes 1.0 2.6 1 Ischemic heart disease 1.6 17.9 2 Cerebrovascular disease 0.9 9.9 3 Lung cancer 0.5 5.6 4 Lower respiratory infections 0.4 4.7 5 COPD 0.4 4.5 6 Alzheimer’s and other dementias 0.4 4.0 7 Colon and rectum cancers 0.3 3.3 8 Diabetes 0.2 2.6 9 Other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases 0.2 2.5 10 Chronic kidney disease 0.2 2.0 1 Malaria 1.1 12.7 2 HIV/AIDS 1.0 12.0 3 Lower respiratory infections 0.8 9.3 4 Diarrheal diseases 0.5 6.6 5 Cerebrovascular disease 0.3 4.0 6 Protein-energy malnutrition 0.3 4.0 7 Tuberculosis 0.3 3.6 8 Road injury 0.2 2.8 9 Preterm birth complications 0.2 2.8 10 Meningitis 0.2 2.6 aThe term developing countries refers to lowand middle-income economies.

At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. Signs and symptoms Cause COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission Virology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Pathophysiology The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with\n\nThe typical symptoms of the mumps virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The incubation period of mumps is usually around 19 days, but it can range from 7 to 23 days. Infected individuals can shed the virus from 1 week before to 1 week after symptom onset, with the highest contagiousness occurring 1 to 2 days before the symptoms appear. The mumps virus primarily replicates in the nasal mucosa or upper respiratory mucosal epithelium during the initial stages of infection. The virus can spread to multiple organs, including the salivary glands, testes, pancreas, ovaries, mammary glands, and central nervous system (CNS). The exact mechanism of mumps encephalitis is still unclear, but it is believed to be a secondary process resulting from respiratory spread and parainfectious inflammation. The virus can infect various organs and may cause symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and swelling of the salivary glands. It's important to practice good hygiene and ensure vaccination to prevent the spread of mumps. The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. The common cold is easily transferable because it is an upper respiratory infection caused by rhinovirus, or other viruses. It is more commonly caused by rhinovirus, because there are more than 100 different types of rhinoviruses which all have a human reservoir; meaning they only house their infections within a human host. The pathogenesis (the ability to cause disease) of a rhinovirus occurs after the incubation period which is usually 1-2 days after encountering the virus. The epithelial cells eventually lyse (burst) releasing large numbers of virus particles into your upper respiratory tract (URT). This cycle repeats continuously and the rhinovirus has the ability to infect the overwhelming amounts of epithelial cells present in your pharynx. As cells die, the release of protein signalling molecules called cytokines recruit leukocytes (white-blood cells) to the site of infection. As the battle between the exponential growth of the virus and the human leukocytes occurs, the symptoms of the common cold are experienced. Often you experience these symptoms because your immune system is trying to battle the virus and clear the infection. When a virus infects a cell, it often inactivates the movement of these tiny hair-like projections on cells which prevent pathogens from entering your lower respiratory tract (LRT). When the ciliary motion (mucociliary escalator) is inactivated due to the increasing amount cell death, the strength of your coughs and sneezes are used to push these pathogens up and out of your URT. To prevent catching the virus, it is recommended to avoid people with the cold, wash hands frequently (not use hand sanitizer), and avoid touching your face. Only 1 case of rhinovirus was observed because it is not as harmful to a healthy individual and is often cleared within two weeks. The lower respiratory tract is sterile and infections in the LRT are often more severe than infections in the URT. Influenza and RSV are both viruses affecting the lower respiratory tract and are far more damaging to the host than rhinovirus. Influenza has an incubation period of roughly 2 days before the onset of symptoms. The symptoms are flu-like and worsen over time with lingering cough, fatigue, and weakness. The pathogenesis of influenza is similar to the rhinovirus as they both multiply within epithelial cells and suppress the mucociliary escalator. There are three types of influenza virus; influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. The letters indicate severity based on the protein coat that the influenza virus possesses. Type A is more severe for humans, as compared to type B and C. Influenza is a unique virus, as it has the ability to change. Influenza has a protein coat which surrounds the genetic material found inside the virus. On the protein coat, influenza has glycoprotein spikes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA glycoproteins are antigens which are often recognised by your immune system as pathogenic. The HA and NA glycoproteins mutate frequently as the virus multiplies over time infecting many individuals. The protein antigens found on the virus in the previous year are completely different from the protein antigens found on the seasonal influenza virus currently, thus making you sick every year. This is known as antigenic drift. The treatment of influenza includes some antiviral mediation, only if it is given at an appropriate time and there are also multivalent vaccines. There have been more reported cases for RSV than influenza and rhinoviruses because it is not necessarily more pathogenic but has a different approach as to how it infects its host and the type of symptoms experienced. The pathogenesis of RSV is slightly different from influenza and rhinovirus because although it may also infect epithelium of the respiratory tract, it causes the bronchioles of the lungs to be partially plugged from the dead sloughed cells of the epithelium. Due to the nature of some RSV virus proteins, it can sometimes be fatal for the elderly population that have underlying conditions. Currently, there few effective antiviral medications available for this infection. Many antivirals like ribavirin are only given to people who have contracted severe cases. Doctors will give the premature babies injections of antibodies to RSV so that this vulnerable population develops a passive immunity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

The reliance on formula-feeding may also increase mortality from other causes, which could offset the advantage of reduced mortality from HIV. This means that the baby should receive only breast milk for the first few months of life, without any additional liquids or solids. Another strategy to mitigate the risks is to provide the baby with antiretroviral therapy (ART) while being breast-fed. In cases where complete avoidance of breast-feeding is not possible or recommended, formula-feeding can be a safe alternative for HIV-infected mothers in developing countries. The aforementioned clinical trial conducted in Kenya showed that formula-feeding led to similar rates of diarrhea, pneumonia, and overall mortality as compared to breast-feeding in this population. Additionally, formula-feeding resulted in a higher rate of survival free of HIV infection at 2 years, indicating potential longer-term benefits. It is crucial to provide appropriate education and support to HIV-infected mothers who opt for formula-feeding. Access to clean water and sanitation facilities is essential to minimize the risk of infection in formula-fed babies. To summarize, while complete avoidance of breast-feeding may not always be feasible in developing countries for HIV-infected mothers, there are strategies to mitigate the risks. In cases where formula-feeding is necessary, proper education, access to clean water, and sanitation facilities are vital to ensure a safe alternative to breast-feeding. Breast milk may be from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy Changes in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II The third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. Breast milk The content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast\n\n Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nBreastfeeding, or nursing, is the process by which human breast milk is fed to a child.

There was, however, no standard curriculum and no agreed framework for setting course content. Covering issues from infection control to training in simulation technology- all have been selected for their urgency, usefulness and relevance to the current challenges in NHS reform. From polyclinics to new mental health strategies, projects look at the education and training implications that arise as control moves away from the centre and into local communities. Exploring new ways to encourage patients to be more involved in their care, the focus here is to respond to an increasing need to communicate and engage with patients in a meaningful and participatory way to deliver better health outcomes. Patients, too, have a role to play to ensure they benefit from good healthcare. While introducing new, more efficient medical technologies can involve increased short-term spending, lasting economic gains can be achieved by reduced treatment costs and a more rapid return to normal, productive life for patients. Improved patient outcomes also help the NHS achieve National Service Framework targets and other Department of Health guidelines. But still the adoption rates are surprisingly low, and the NHS still seems to be slow on the uptake and resistant to change, even when the arguments are very strong. The irony is that all of the new technology shown is in fact in use now in England in teaching trusts and could be widely available if only clinicians and managers would be willing to invest time, training and some initial investment in getting these new techniques adopted for the wider benefit of patients across the country. Knowledge sharing often occurred in the past, though there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not it occurs more frequently today. This industry experienced a \"free exchange of information about new techniques and plant designs among firms in an industry\". According to economic historian Robert Allen, the \n\n Acculturation is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed. Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\". This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction. Innovation, i.e. the establishment of a new molecular function, can occur via side-activities of genes and thus proteins this is called Enzyme promiscuity. Since the 1950s, entrepreneurial clustering had followed the Silicon Valley model of suburban corridors with sprawling research centers and campuses. In the early 2000s, European and American cities began to mimic these areas through policy and planning. Some innovation districts have helped cities add jobs, and shift economic focus from traditional industrial-based production to technology-driven services. A wave of academic research is examining these effects.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), contingency management (CM), and the Matrix Model are some of the aftercare interventions found effective in improving retention in treatment, reducing methamphetamine abuse, delaying relapse and encouraging abstinence, improvement in employment status and reduction in use of other drugs among methamphetamine users. Additionally, aftercare interventions have been found effective in reducing HIV risk behavior, psychiatric symptoms of paranoia and depression, and engagement in criminal activities. The relevance of relapse prevention management in methamphetamine recovery is supported by high relapse rate among those trying to quit. Genetic vulnerability has been associated with both methamphetamine addiction (like other chemical addictions) and diabetes mellitus. Avoiding a drug-using peer group or other high-risk situations play an important role while one is trying to quit methamphetamine. Similar low rates of treatment compliance are seen among methamphetamine users as well. Continuing care for methamphetamine users refers to interventions offered beyond the initial phase of treatment with an aim to prevent relapse and encourage drug-free lifestyle. It is based on a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for tackling methamphetamine addiction whereby recovery is sought across multiple domains - spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical. However, the approach has been found to be effective with users of other stimulant drugs such as cocaine and has been reported to hold promise for methamphetamine users as well. Retention and regular attendance in meetings is expected to be a challenge based on experience with similar programs for other stimulant drugs. In spite of lack of a well established pharmacological option, aftercare for methamphetamine users still may require follow-up medical care. Effective management of these health conditions shall warrant follow-up medical care. Furthermore, reduced substance use, criminal activity as well as improvement of mental and physical health among those completing these types of programs has been observed. Contingency management (CM) aims at preventing or reducing drug use by using positive reinforcement in the form of vouchers or other benefits, exchangeable for goods or privileges and cash rewards for drug free behavior. and talk to a member of our treatment\n\nPositive approaches are more effective than punitive approaches for people with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) who misuse drugs because of the underlying neuropsychology of many individuals with ASPD. in 2003 found that people with ASPD who received contingency management (a positive approach involving rewards or incentives for desired behaviors) were more likely to abstain from cocaine use compared to participants without ASPD receiving contingency management or cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as participants with ASPD receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. This suggests that individuals with ASPD and drug misuse issues are more motivated by positive reinforcement and rewards rather than punitive measures. Positive approaches provide incentives and rewards for desired behaviors, which can help motivate individuals with ASPD to change their behavior and engage in healthier habits. By focusing on positive approaches such as contingency management, treatment providers can create an environment that encourages individuals with ASPD and drug misuse problems to make positive changes in their lives.

Risks to the organisation: poor quality is a threat to any organisation. In addition to reducing risks to patients and practitioners, organisations need to reduce their own risks by ensuring high quality employment practice (including locum procedures and reviews of individual and team performance), a safe environment (including estates and privacy), and well designed policies on public involvement. Balancing these risk components may be an ideal that is difficult to achieve in practice. Recent research by Fischer and colleagues at the University of Oxford finds that tensions between 'first order' risks (based on clinical care) and 'second order' risks (based on organisational reputation) can produce unintended contradictions, conflict, and may even precipitate organisational crisis. This is a complex issue because if two people, knowing the risk of transmission, voluntarily agree not to use a condom, they are consenting to an activity that risks the transmission of any sexually transmitted disease. But if one partner is aware of being HIV positive, the other partner should expect a warning or if not, at least a truthful answer to \n\nContingency management is a therapeutic approach that utilizes reinforcement techniques to encourage certain desired behaviors. It involves providing incentives or rewards to individuals who demonstrate specific behaviors, such as abstinence from drugs, reduction in drug misuse, or adherence to interventions that improve physical health outcomes. The main goal of contingency management is to promote positive behavior change and ultimately reduce illicit drug use. There are several concerns regarding contingency management that need to be addressed. One concern is the perception that this intervention may \"reward\" illicit drug use. However, it is important to note that contingency management focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are consistent with recovery and sobriety, rather than rewarding drug use itself. Another concern is whether the effects of contingency management can be maintained in the long term. While some studies have shown short-term effectiveness, there is evidence suggesting that longer-term maintenance of behavior change can be challenging. However, implementing strategies for ongoing support and monitoring can help address this issue and increase the likelihood of sustained positive outcomes. Additionally, there are concerns about potential abuse of the system, as individuals may attempt to cheat their drug tests in order to receive incentives. To mitigate this risk, careful implementation and monitoring protocols should be put in place to ensure accurate testing and prevent manipulation. It's important to consider that while most research on contingency management has been conducted in the United States, there have also been studies conducted in Europe and Australia which provide additional evidence for its effectiveness. In conclusion, contingency management offers a promising approach for addressing concerns related to illicit drug use by utilizing reinforcement techniques. While challenges exist regarding perceptions of rewarding drug use, long-term effects, abuse potential, and generalizability to different healthcare systems, strategies can be implemented to mitigate these concerns. By incorporating evidence-based practices from various studies conducted globally, contingency management can be effectively utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing drug misuse and promoting positive behavior change.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Astroviruses are 28–35 nm diameter, icosahedral viruses that have a characteristic five- or six-pointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle Astroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome Astroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution The Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus Mamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans Members of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised.

Antibodies recognize specific antigens and bind to them, marking them for destruction or neutralization by other components of the immune system. Memory cells are more numerous than the naïve cells present before encountering the antigen and can rapidly respond when reexposed to the same antigen. This memory response is why vaccination aims to stimulate the production of memory cells. They coordinate immune responses and eliminate infected or abnormal cells. Antibodies, produced by B lymphocytes, recognize and target antigens for destruction or neutralization. Cellular immunity protects the body through: Cell-mediated immunity is directed primarily at microbes that survive in phagocytes and microbes that infect non-phagocytic cells. Type 1 immunity is directed primarily at viruses, bacteria, and protozoa and is responsible for activating macrophages, turning them into potent effector cells. different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune response. After an antigen binds to a BCR, the B cell activates to proliferate and differentiate into either \n\n The physiology and immune system of birds resembles that of other animals. The avian immune system is divided into two types of immunity, the innate and adaptive ones. The innate immune system includes physical and chemical barriers, blood proteins and phagocytic cells. In addition, complement serum proteins, which are a part of the innate immune system, work with antibodies to lyse target cell. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, kicks in when the innate system fails to stop invading pathogens. The adaptive response includes targeted recognition of specific molecular features on the surface of the pathogen. It is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. When a foreign substance, also known as an antigen, enters the body, specialized cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognize and capture the antigen. Once the antigens are recognized, these immune cells activate and initiate an immune response tailored to that particular foreign substance. These immune complexes help in neutralizing the foreign substances and targeting them for elimination by other immune cells, such as macrophages. The immune system also has a remarkable ability to remember previous encounters with antigens. This is known as immunological memory. When the body is exposed to the same antigen again, memory T cells and B cells rapidly respond, leading to a quicker and more effective immune response. This memory response is the basis for the effectiveness of vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to create an immunological memory without causing the disease. In summary, the immune system recognizes foreign substances through specialized cells, mounts an immune response tailored to that particular substance, and neutralizes them through the production of antibodies, immune complexes, and the activation of other immune cells. Its ability to remember previous encounters allows for a faster and more efficient response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

There are currently seven drugs approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, including injectable interferon (IFN) α, pegylated interferon (PEG IFN), and various oral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. While clinical trials often focus on short-term outcomes achieved over 1-2 years, these gains have long-term implications in reducing the risk of clinical progression, hepatic decompensation, and death. Although standard IFN is no longer used to treat hepatitis B, it played a significant role historically and provided important insights into antiviral therapy in general.

These viruses are passed through sexual contact; through transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products; through sharing of contaminated needles and syringes among injection drug users; intrapartum or perinatally from mother to infant; or via breast milk. There is a definite, though small, occupational risk of infection for health care workers and laboratory personnel who work with HIV-infected specimens. #### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**\n\nAs of January 1, 2010, an estimated 1,108,611 cumulative cases of AIDS had been diagnosed in the United States; there have been approximately 600,000 deaths due to AIDS.As of January 1, 2010, an estimated 1.1 million HIV-infected persons were living in the United States; approximately 21% of these individuals are unaware that they are infected.An estimated 56,000 individuals are newly infected each year in the United States; this figure has remained stable for at least 15 years (Fig.189-12, p. 1518, in HPIM-18). In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. The death rate of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was around 50 percent. During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak.

Gallo is also a co-founder of biotechnology company Profectus BioSciences, Inc. and co-founder and scientific director of the Global Virus Network (GVN). He earned a BS degree in Biology in 1959 from Providence College and received an MD from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1963. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the discovery of human retroviruses After listening to a talk by biologist David Baltimore and further stimulation from his virologist colleague, Robert Ting, concerning the work of the late Howard Martin Temin, Gallo became interested in the study of retroviruses, and made their study the primary activity of his lab. In 1976, Doris Morgan, a first year post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab, was asked by Gallo to examine culture fluid of activated lymphocytes for the possible production of growth factors. Gallo, Morgan and Frank Ruscetti, another researcher in Gallo's lab, coauthored a paper in Science describing their method. However, cell growth was not demonstrated and the affected cell type was not identified, making the identity of the factor(s) involved unclear and its natural function unknown. This breakthrough also allowed researchers to grow T-cells and study the viruses that affect them, such as human T-cell leukemia virus, or HTLV, the first retrovirus identified in humans, which Bernard Poiesz, another post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab played a key role in its isolation. In 1982, Gallo received the Lasker Award: \"For his pioneering studies that led to the discovery of the first human RNA tumor virus [the old name for retroviruses] and its association with certain leukemias and lymphomas.\" HIV/AIDS research On May 4, 1984, Gallo and his collaborators published a series of four papers in the scientific journal Science demonstrating that a retrovirus they had isolated, called HTLV-III in the belief that the virus was related to the leukemia viruses of Gallo's earlier work, was the cause of AIDS. A French team at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, led by Luc Montagnier, had published a paper in Science in 1983, describing a retrovirus they called LAV (lymphadenopathy associated virus), isolated from a patient at risk for AIDS. Gallo was awarded his second Lasker Award in 1986 for \"determining that the retrovirus now known as HIV-1 is the cause of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\" In 1986, Gallo, Dharam Ablashi, and Syed Zaki Salahuddin discovered human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), later found to cause Roseola infantum, an infantile disease. In 1991, following years of controversy surrounding a 1987 out of court settlement between the National Institutes of Health and France's Pasteur Institute, Gallo admitted the virus he claimed to have discovered in 1984 was in reality a virus sent to him from France the year before, putting an end to a six-year effort by Gallo and his employer, the National Institutes of Health, to claim the AIDS virus as an independent discovery. Gallo and two longtime scientific collaborators, Robert R. Redfield and William A. Blattner, founded the Institute of Human Virology in 1996. Priority and the 2008 Nobel Prize Assignment of priority for the discovery of HIV has been controversial and was a subplot in the 1993 American television film docudrama (and earlier book about the early history of AIDS) And the Band Played On. Investigations by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the HHS ultimately cleared Gallo's group of any wrongdoing and demonstrated that they had numerous isolates of HIV of their own. As part of these investigations, the United States Office of Research Integrity at the National Institutes of Health commissioned Hoffmann–La Roche scientists to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. They concluded that the virus used in Gallo's lab had come from Montagnier's lab; it was a virus from a patient that had\n\nSince 1996, Dr. Robert C. Gallo has been Director of the Institute of Human Virology and Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Gallo and his colleagues then opened and pioneered the field of human retrovirology with the discovery of the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) and along with Japanese investigators showed it was a cause of a particular form of human leukemia. A year later he and his group discovered the second known human retrovirus (HTLV-2). In 1986 he and his co-workers discovered human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), the first new herpes virus found in more than 25 years and the cause of Roseola. it \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal Science on 20 May 1983. A team led by Robert Gallo of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of Science and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab. Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was \n\n Immunodeficiency resembling human AIDS was reported in captive monkeys in the United States beginning in 1983.

There are two major groups of retroviruses that infect humans: the **oncoretroviruses** ( _onco-_ , \"related to a tumor\") and the **lentiviruses** ( _lenti-_ , \"slow\"). There are several other groups of retroviruses that infect animals. Endogenous retrovirus sequences are found throughout the human genome. Like most enveloped viruses, all retroviruses are highly susceptible to factors that affect surface tension and are thus not transmissible through air, dust, or fomites under normal conditions, but instead require intimate contact with the infecting sources, such as bodily fluids, blood, and blood-derived products.

Surveillance systems are generally called upon to provide information regarding when and where health problems are occurring and who is affected. Public health surveillance systems can be passive or active. Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination. Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States. Syndromic surveillance Syndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate disease outbreaks. According to a CDC definition, \"the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials.\" The first indications of disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns. When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue. An early awareness and response to a bioterrorist attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process. A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by Gunther Eysenbach, who began work on such a system in 2004. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modeling from Google search queries have been proposed. Search trends provide indirect data on public health, while the latter two methods provide direct data. Wikipedia has also been used, though it is potentially prone to \"noise\", as it is a popular source of health information whether a user is ill or not. This methodology has also been used by Public Health England in the United Kingdom as one of their syndromic surveillance endpoints. It is the most used social media platform for public health surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance Some conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. The\n\nThe field of epidemiology has evolved significantly over time, building upon the foundational work of pioneers such as Hippocrates, Semmelweis, and John Snow. The specific techniques employed depend on the type of disease being studied, but there are some common approaches that are frequently used. One commonly employed approach is surveillance. This involves systematically collecting data on cases of a particular disease within a defined population or geographical area. Surveillance can be passive, relying on reports from healthcare providers or laboratories, or active, where researchers actively seek out cases through surveys or other means. In these studies, individuals who are initially free from the disease of interest are followed over time to assess their risk of developing the condition. These studies involve comparing individuals with a certain disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls), and examining differences in exposures or characteristics between the two groups. These involve collecting data at a single point in time from individuals within a population or community. They examine associations between exposure levels and health outcomes across different populations or geographical areas. By employing these methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into disease patterns, risk factors, and potential interventions to improve public health. The COVID Symptom Study requires users to give their location. Based on the \n\nPublic health departments at different levels commonly use a variety of surveillance systems to monitor and track public health issues. This helps to detect and control the spread of infectious diseases, such as influenza, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections. Syndromic Surveillance: Syndromic surveillance systems monitor the signs and symptoms of diseases instead of waiting for laboratory confirmation. This can include monitoring emergency department visits, over-the-counter medication sales, or school absenteeism rates to detect outbreaks or public health emergencies. Survey-Based Surveillance: Public health departments may conduct surveys to gather information on various health issues. Environmental Monitoring: Public health departments also monitor environmental factors that impact health, such as air and water quality, food safety, and workplace hazards. This surveillance helps identify and address potential health risks in the community. These surveillance systems, among others, assist public health departments in collecting timely and accurate data to inform decision-making and interventions aimed at protecting and promoting the health of the population. This surveillance system involves a voluntary network of doctors, laboratories, and public health departments. By collecting data on disease rates from this network, sentinel surveillance helps assess the stability or change in the health levels of a population. By focusing on specific diseases or conditions, this type of surveillance allows for targeted monitoring and early detection of potential outbreaks or epidemics. Its focus on targeted monitoring, early detection, and representative sampling contributes to our understanding of disease trends and aids in public health decision-making.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the nervous system. Generally polio affects children under three, but adults can contract it as well. Polio is incurable but it can be easily prevented through immunization. Two types of vaccines are used. The first utilizes a live attenuated (weakened) poliovirus and is administered through oral drops. In countries where the wild poliovirus is still in circulation, this oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used because administering OPV requires minimal training and equipment. The second type of vaccine is an inactivated (killed) polio vaccine that is injected (IPV). The inactivated polio vaccine is used primarily in countries where the wild poliovirus has already been eliminated. However, poor health and malnutrition can slow the rate at which a childâ€™s immune system â€œconvertsâ€� the polio vaccine. It is not harmful to receive multiple doses of polio vaccine during immunization rounds. It is critical to immunize every child, every round; in fact, the more doses a child receives, the more protected he or she is against polio. UNICEF currently procures all the oral polio vaccine for national immunization days â€“ more than 10 billion doses since the campaign began. These vaccines are at work now, battling diseases like polio, measles and maternal & neonatal tetanus and saving hundreds of thousands of young lives in more than 100 poor countries around the world. Monovalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV) for the three types of polioviruses were used extensively in the early days of polio vaccination in the late 1950s and early 1960s, providing extensive experience of these vaccines. With tOPV, protection against all three types of wild poliovirus could be given at the same time, a very important consideration when more than one type of wild poliovirus was circulating. It also recommended the use of mOPV1 in supplementary immunization campaigns for areas where only wild poliovirus type 1 was circulating. The use of mOPV1 in India and Nigeria has shown remarkable progress in curbing type 1 wild polio virus. The other type of monovalent polio vaccine is type 3 vaccine (mOPV3). Poliomyelitis, commonly shortened to polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected fecal matter entering the mouth. The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, multiple doses are required for it to be effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is endemic. In 2018, there were 33 cases of wild polio and 104 cases of vaccine-derived polio. Vaccine-derived polio is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine and that has changed over time and behaves more like the naturally occurring virus. In 2019, there were 175 cases of wild polio and 364 cases of vaccine-derived polio. Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. In the 20th century, it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. Two basic patterns of polio infection are described: a minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system (CNS), sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis, and a major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic. In most people with a normal immune system, a poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. Cause Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a member of the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified – poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3) – each with a slightly different capsid protein. Individuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by immunization via polio vaccine, develop immunity. In immune individuals, IgA antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract and able to block virus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype. A rare condition with a similar presentation, nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis, may result from infections with nonpoliovirus enteroviruses. Transmission Poliomyelitis is highly contagious via the fecal–oral (intestinal source) and the oral–oral (oropharyngeal source) routes. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect virtually the entire human population. Factors that increase the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus does not appear to be affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life. Pathophysiology Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth, infecting the first cells with which it comes in contact – the pharynx and intestinal mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily\n\n In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year.

It is highly infectious and caused by three types of wild polio viruses: type 1, type 2, and type 3. It's important to note that not all individuals infected with the polio virus will experience symptoms. To prevent polio, immunization is crucial. Polio vaccines are available in two forms: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). It helps protect against infection caused by wild (naturally occurring) polio viruses. On the other hand, IPV is an injectable vaccine that contains inactivated (killed) polio viruses and provides immunity against all three types of polio virus. Vaccination is the most effective and reliable method to prevent polio. It not only protects individuals from acquiring the infection but also helps in preventing the transmission of the polio virus within communities. In many parts of the world, widespread vaccination campaigns have successfully eliminated polio transmission. However, it is important to continue immunization efforts to maintain this progress and prevent polio resurgence. It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the contamination of a specific batch of oral polio vaccine in some regions. However, overall, polio vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing polio. Vaccination remains the best preventive measure against polio and continues to be recommended by health authorities worldwide.

Privacy is an important ethical concern when implementing NHDWHs. Informed consent and trust are also critical considerations. Secondary data use is another ethical issue. Sustainability and implementation validity are important ethical considerations as well. Governance and conflict of interest should also be addressed. Any potential conflicts of interest should be identified and addressed to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. Regarding justice, equity, and access, it is essential to consider the potential impact of NHDWHs on marginalized populations or individuals with limited access to healthcare. By considering privacy, informed consent and trust, confidentiality and security, secondary data use, sustainability and implementation validity, risk-benefit ratio, governance and conflict of interest, justice, equity, access, and collaborative partnerships, countries and implementers can make informed decisions and create ethical frameworks to guide the implementation of NHDWHs within LMICs. Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, \"nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning,\" whereby it is \"the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice.\" This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research. And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision. controversial due to their association with eugenics. As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy, history, and sociology. Medical ethics encompasses beneficence, autonomy, and justice as they relate to conflicts such as euthanasia, patient confidentiality, informed consent, and conflicts of interest in healthcare. In addition, medical ethics and culture are interconnected as different cultures implement ethical values differently, sometimes placing more emphasis on family values and downplaying the importance of autonomy. This leads to an increasing need for culturally sensitive physicians and ethical committees in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Increasingly, medical ethics deems such actions to be medical paternalism, and they are discouraged in modern medicine. A hypothetical example demonstrates the increased engagement of a patient operating in a Health 2.0 setting: a patient goes to see their primary care physician with a presenting complaint, having first ensured their own medical record was up to date via the Internet. The treating physician might make a diagnosis or send for tests, the results of \n\nSocial media data can be utilized as a new health \"vital sign\" by monitoring patients' real-time information about their health behaviors and outcomes. Establishing guidelines and protocols: Health systems and clinics can develop guidelines for collecting and analyzing social media data. These guidelines should prioritize patient privacy, consent, and security. Building partnerships: Collaborations between healthcare providers, public health officials, and social media platforms can facilitate the ethical use of social media data. This can enhance their understanding of the data's potential benefits and limitations, as well as ethical considerations. This includes adhering to regulations governing data collection, storage, and sharing, as well as safeguarding patient confidentiality.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Hepatitis B infections, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, are unacceptably high in Indigenous Australians. Interestingly, hepatitis B used to be known as the “Australia Antigen” as it was first discovered in Australian Aboriginal people in the 1960s. Hepatitis B is around ten times more prevalent in Indigenous communities than in the rest of Australia. Of the nearly 240,000 Australians estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B, over 20,000 are thought to be Indigenous people. New infections with hepatitis B remain three times as common in Indigenous people as in non-Indigenous Australians. The chance of developing chronic hepatitis B depends on an individual’s age at the time of infection. Around 90% of those who were exposed as infants develop chronic hepatitis B, but only 5% of those who were exposed as adults will develop chronic infection. Most people living with chronic hepatitis B were infected as young children – often, through mother-to-child transmission at the time of birth. The prevalence of chronic (long-term) hepatitis B in Indigenous Australians varies significantly between regions. The prevalence of hepatitis B and other communicable diseases such as skin infections and influenza in Indigenous communities is intensified by the social, economic, environmental and political situation in which Indigenous Australians find themselves. In some people, chronic hepatitis B can cause severe liver scarring (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. Chronic liver disease contributes significantly to the Indigenous life expectancy gap. In the NT, a range of factors contribute to the unequal burden of liver cancer in Indigenous Australians, but hepatitis B is the most important cause. A safe, effective vaccine for hepatitis B has been provided for all infants in Australia since 2000 – and in the Northern Territory since 1990. As a result, new hepatitis B infections in children born since 2000, as well as those who received adolescent catch-up vaccination from 1998 onwards, have fallen markedly. However, funded hepatitis B vaccine for Indigenous adults is available only in some states and territories. A recent study suggested a funded catch-up vaccination program for Indigenous adults could rapidly eliminate disparity in hepatitis B incidence. Vaccination has no effect for those who already have chronic hepatitis B. It is believed over 90,000 Australians living with hepatitis B have never been diagnosed and are unaware of their infection. Only 15% of those infected are receiving treatment or monitoring for their condition. Unlike hepatitis C, hepatitis B is not yet curable, but current treatments are very well tolerated and effective at preventing liver disease and liver cancer. The profound lack of access to treatment and care among Indigenous people contributes to the disproportionate impact of hepatitis B on this population. Under the management of Miwatj Health, an Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation, a hepatitis specialist visits regularly three to four times per year. Just as importantly, a local healthcare practitioner champions the cause of hepatitis B treatment and elimination. Several other regions in the world with large Indigenous populations and high hepatitis B prevalence, such as Alaska and New Zealand, have developed programs to test most of the population and identify those with hepatitis B infections. Also important is partnering with communities and their health workers to develop new ways of building awareness of hepatitis B as an important health issue. With comprehensive public health initiatives, long-term commitment to funding and policy – including significant workforce development to ensure as many people as possible are tested and appropriately followed up – the impact of hepatitis B on Indigenous communities can be eliminated. In the case of acute hepatitis B infection, treatment is supportive, meaning that it is given with the aim of maintaining comfort, nutrition and fluids but not to cure the disease. People who have chronic hepatitis B infection are recommended to see their doctor or specialist regularly for a check-up. If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may have to take medicines for the rest of your life. Routine immunisation protects your child from hepatitis B, but see a GP if your child has symptoms like jaundice. Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus and occurs worldwide. Hepatitis B vaccines are available and require a series of three doses over six months. Infected hepatitis B virus infants are more likely to develop complications such as chronic infection, cirrhosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). It is unknown whether hepatitis B vaccine protects health-care workers from infection of mutated hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus. Around 350 million people worldwide are chronic infected carriers of the virus. Chronic hepatitis B is a very common infectious disease leading to chronic liver disease, affecting around 350 million people all over the world. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations – infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death, the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (median survival time) in sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. In Japan, chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC ) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. It occurs in the setting of chronic liver inflammation, and is most closely linked to chronic viral hepatitis infection (hepatitis B or C) or exposure to toxins such as alcohol, aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The vast majority of HCC and lowest survival rate after treatment occurs in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, in countries where hepatitis B infection is endemic and many are infected from birth. Why is it recommended that newborn babies be vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) if it is a sexually transmitted disease? Infants are much more at risk for developing chronic hepatitis B than older children and adults. The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood and bodily fluids of an infected person and results in a serious liver disease. There is no cure for hepatitis B. Some of the long-term (chronic) health issues related to this virus are liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer. These long-term health problems are directly related to when a person is first infected. Is hepatitis B transmitted sexually? In addition, the population that people often associate with hep B is IV drug users; but this, too, is a misconception. Half of all parents do not know how their child acquired hepatitis B. The hepatitis B vaccine can protect the infant against the infection if given within 24 hours of exposure to the virus. Acquiring hepatitis B in the first few months of life comes with a high probability that your child will have hepatitis B the rest of his or her life. Why not just screen pregnant women for hepatitis B? Some people (up to 7 out of 10) who have chronic hepatitis B may have few or no symptoms and not appear to be ill and so may not know they are infected. “Hepatitis B is an adult disease, is not highly contagious, is not deadly for most who contract it, and is not in epidemic form in the US (except among high risk groups such as IV drug addicts).” – The National Vaccine Information Center’s argument against infant vaccination. An estimated 200,000 people are newly infected with the virus every year. Of these 200,000 infected, 90% (mostly adults and children over the age of 6) eventually recover and clear the virus, but over 11,000 will have to be hospitalized and over 20,000 (10%) will become chronically (permanently) infected with the virus. Hepatitis B infection kills up to 4,000 Americans every year—that is more deaths than from all other childhood vaccine-preventable diseases combined. People, including children, with hepatitis B have 200 times greater risk of developing liver cancer. 90% of people who contract hepatitis B will clear the virus. In contrast, 90% of infants under the age of 1 who contract hepatitis B will have it for their entire lives, which puts them at high risk for liver cancer, cirrhosis and other liver-related complications. The US is the only country which recommends the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. According to the World Health Organization, as of July 2011, 179 countries vaccinate infants against hepatitis B as part of their recommended childhood vaccination schedules. After several studies showed no correlation between multiple sclerosis and the hepatitis B vaccine, the recommendation was reinstated. Before the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine, over 30,000 children were infected annually. An estimated 1.25 million people are currently chronically infected with the HBV in the US, resulting in up to 4,000 deaths each year from hepatitis B liver disease. Since only 7 out of 10 infected adults show any signs or symptoms, and infected children under age 5 rarely show any symptoms at all, it is obvious how the infected population can easily, and unknowingly, be transmitting the disease to others. Many people believe that young kids in the United States don’t become infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) except through perinatal transmission, when HBV-infected moms pass it to their newborn children. Southeast Asia, China), but in fact the majority of early childhood HBV infections occur among African American and white children. It’s estimated that 33,000 kids (10 years of age and younger) born to moms who are not infected with HBV were infected each year prior to implementation of routine childhood hepatitis B vaccination. In addition, an estimated 12,000 kids born to HBV-infected moms were infected each year before implementation of immunization programs to prevent perinatal HBV infections.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.
