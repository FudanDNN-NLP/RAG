[57] used multiple linear regression to estimate the amount of variance of the SPPB summary score that was accounted for by an alternative method of measurement, self-reported function, adjusting for age and sex. They found that self-reported function alone accounted for 42% of the variance and that adding age and sex to the model accounted for an additional 4%, which illustrates that while the proportion of variance explained by self-reported function was high, there was still a considerable proportion of variance that remained unexplained. With regression, different variances may be observed depending on the assignment of measures to independent and dependent variables. It is often useful to compare the measure being validated to relevant outcomes of interest.Using Cox proportional hazards regression, Guralnik et al. For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis ) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression). First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has \n\n In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and \n\n The earliest form of regression was the method of least squares, which was published by Legendre in 1805, and by Gauss in 1809. The term \"regression\" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards \n\nAccording to the Gauss-Markov theorem, for the least-squares estimator to be the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the coefficients in a linear model, several conditions need to be satisfied. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables should be linear. This means that the model can be expressed as a linear combination of the coefficients and independent variables. It's important to note that while these conditions are necessary for achieving BLUE estimators, they do not require assumptions about normal distribution, independence, or identical distribution of errors. The Gauss-Markov theorem relaxes these assumptions and only requires zero expectation, uncorrelatedness, and equal variances of errors for obtaining BLUE estimators.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

References\n\nExternal links\n\nCerebral white matter\n\nSome intrinsic evaluation tasks that can be used to compare embedding models based on clinician judgment in the field of clinical natural language processing are term pair similarity and cloze task accuracy. Term pair similarity evaluates non-contextual word embeddings (NCWEs) by measuring the similarity between pairs of terms. On the other hand, cloze task accuracy assesses contextual word embeddings (CWEs) by measuring how accurately the model can predict missing words in a given context. In a study titled \"Intrinsic Evaluation of Contextual and Non-contextual Word Embeddings using Radiology Reports,\" researchers developed these intrinsic evaluation tasks using a corpus of radiology reports. They compared embedding models trained on different corpora, such as a custom radiology report corpus, a general corpus, and PubMed and MIMIC-III corpora. The study found that for term pair similarity, embeddings trained on the PubMed and MIMIC-III corpora (P&MC) outperformed other non-contextual word embedding models (NCWEs). Cloze task accuracy, on the other hand, was equivalent for models trained on the custom radiology report corpus (RRC) and the P&MC corpora. Among the NCWE models trained on the RRC, fastText models often performed better than other models in the term pair similarity task. This suggests that P&MC-trained NCWEs and RRC-trained fastText models may be particularly effective for intrinsic evaluation based on clinician judgment. Therefore, by using term pair similarity and cloze task accuracy, researchers can compare embedding models and assess their effectiveness in representing the language used in clinical natural language processing tasks, based on clinician judgment. The proposed methodology for adaptively customizing activation functions in neural networks involves adding a few parameters to traditional activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, and rectified linear unit (ReLU). The effectiveness of this methodology has been verified through theoretical and experimental analysis. In terms of convergence speed, precision, and generalization across different network models, datasets, optimization strategies, and recognition tasks, the proposed methodology has shown promising results. Experimental analysis has been conducted using various network models including AlexNet, VggNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Different datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and COCO have been utilized for evaluation. The methodology has also been tested with different optimization strategies (such as SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and ADAM) and recognition tasks, including classification and detection, further confirming its validity and suitability across various scenarios.

This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification. Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data. Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification. Many machine learning algorithms are designed and applied for microarray classification problem which some of them provided fruitful results but due to the challenges of dealing with microarrays researchers are still working on designing more accurate, robust, and interpretable models for microarray classification. Since microarrays have a large set of features but a small set of samples, feature selection methods are applied on them to eliminate noisy and irrelevant features. Furthermore, feature selection decreases the chance of overfitting and increases the chance of producing more understandable results. Two broad categories of feature selection techniques are filter and wrapper methods . On the other hand, the multivariate filter methods like multiple hypothesis testing models [5, 6] consider the interconnection between features and are slower than univariate approaches. It is important to note that univariate filter methods are usually faster than the multivariate filter methods as they ignore interconnection of genes and the multivariate filter methods are usually faster than wrapper methods as they ignore interactions with the classifier, but wrapper methods and multivariate filter methods consider interconnection of genes and have the chance of finding the best subset that work together in determination of the class label of the given problem. Supervised learning is a process in which the class labels of a set of instances are given and by applying a learning method, we build a classifier which can be used later in determining the class label of new instances. There are different ways of evaluating the performance of a classifier like using a separate test data, cross-validation, bootstrap sampling, and sub-sampling as surveyed and described in [7, 8]. Various classification models have been applied on microarrays like support vector machine (SVM) [11, 12], artificial neural network (ANN) , decision trees [10, 14], k nearest neighbors (KNN) , diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) . SVM in a binary classification problem finds maximum margin classifier among many different classifiers that can separate instances of two classes. The points that lie closest to this max-margin hyperplane are called the support vectors. The hyperplane can be defined using these points alone and the classifier only makes use of these support vectors to classify test samples. In the case that data points are not linearly separable in the input space, one solution is to map the input space into a higher dimensional feature space called kernel space . The reasons of its good performance are its ability in dealing with high dimensional problems, ability in dealing with noisy features, scalability, and its high generalization power. ANN is an interconnected group of nodes that uses a computational model for information processing. It changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network. A decision tree like classification and regression trees (CART) consists of a set of internal nodes and leaf nodes. The internal nodes are associated with a splitting criterion which consists of a splitting attribute and one or more splitting predicates defined on this attribute. The leaf nodes are labelled with a single class label. In the first phase, the growing phase, an overgrown decision tree is built from the training data. The splitting criterion at each internal node is chosen to split the data sets into subsets that have better class separability, thus minimizing the misclassification error. Decision trees have been widely used in microarray studies. They have many advantages that make them a suitable choice for microarray classification like scalability, fast setup, independence of input parameters, and generating rule-based models. Disadvantage of decision trees that appears in high dimensional problems like microarray classification is that they become overfitted easily [10, 14]. In KNN classifier, class label of an unseen instance is determined by a majority voting on the class label of its k nearest neighbors and correlation or Euclidean distance is usually used to calculate distance of two samples. KNN was used for the purpose of microarray classification by Dudoit, Fridlyand, and Speed . The basic idea of LDA is to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space such that the data points are reshaped to maximize the class separability. (2007) compared different methods, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) and Kernel Logistic Regression, for multi-class probabilities in medical decision making. (2014, 2015) developed automated classification systems using machine learning techniques like support vector machines and image processing with a local binary pattern operator. (2003) developed least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) models to predict the malignancy of ovarian tumors. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs \n\nLDC â Classification happens based on the value obtained from the linear combination of the feature values, which are usually provided in the form of vector features. ; k-NN â Classification happens by locating the object in the feature space, and comparing it with the k nearest neighbors (training examples). ; GMM â is a probabilistic model used for representing the existence of subpopulations within the overall population.

We aim to learn discriminant compact features at beginning of our deep convolutional neural network. Key words: breast cancer, biopsy, deep learning, machine learning, VGG16, convolutional neural network. This success has prompted a surge of interest in applying deep convolutional networks (DCN) to medical imaging. Many recent studies have shown the potential of applying such networks to medical imaging, including breast screening mammography; however, without investigating the fundamental differences between medical and natural images and their impact on the design choices and performance of proposed models. For instance, many recent works have either significantly downscaled a whole image or focused on classifying a small region of interest. 2278â2324] is a classifier that takes an image x as input, often with multiple channels corresponding to different colors (e.g., RGB), and outputs the conditional probability distribution over the categories. This is done by a series of nonlinear functions that gradually transform the input pixel-level image. A major property of the deep convolutional network, which distinguishes it from a multi-layer perceptron, is that it heavily relies on convolutional and pooling layers, which make the network invariant to local translation of visual features in the input. Slides from the 1-st and 2-d sources was also divided on 50x50 pixel patches. In situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma (label 1) â 397632 patches. In situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma (label 1) â 79526 patches. We using Keras for model training (currently transfer learning by fine-tuning a modified Vgg16 model). Our model takes as input the pixel values of the individual samples and is trained to predict the probability is this sample from the malignant tumor or from normal tissue. We chose a VGG-16 network to classify the 50Ã50 histology image patches in order to explore the scale and organization features of nuclei and the scale features of the overall structure. Because they do not have complicated high-level semantic information, a 16-layer structure suffices. To leverage contextual information from the cropped images, we added global context to the last convolutional layer of the VGG networks. The input images are passed to two independent branches, our VGG network and a global average pooling layer. The transformed output of the global pooling layer is unpooled to the same shape as that of the feature maps after the last convolutional layer of the VGG network and is then concatenated with the feature maps. These two feature maps are then fused by another 1Ã1 convolutional layer and then passed through three fully-connected (FC) layers for classification. The most informative magnification level is still debatable, so weâve included two possible scales in our work for comparison. The AWS g3 instance has NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs, each with 2048 parallel processing cores and 8 GiB of video memory which enables to run a complicated network structure. The reason that we can do so is because the ImageNet has very large amount of dataset and is trained quite well. We can make full use of the pre-trained model and get the feature based on the ImageNet dataset. where TN(true negative) is the number of non-cancer patches(normal tissue or benign lesions) which have been successfully classified, and FP(false positive) is the number of non-cancer patches which have been wrongly classified as cancer. In the data science competitions(like Kaggle competitions),the competitors were evaluated their results using the log-loss metric. To assess overall classification relevance, we therefore compute the F1-score, too. In this paper, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network architecture for binary classification of breast tissue biopsies that had aimed to learn high-order convolutional features at the initial layers of the model. - Access mode: NationalBreastCancerFoundation.

Computerized medical imaging\n\nThe main difference between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other artificial neural networks is the inclusion of the convolutional part. This inclusion of the convolutional part directly increases the performance of artificial neural networks, particularly in tasks that involve image and video processing. CNNs excel in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data. Additionally, CNNs have fewer parameters compared to fully connected neural networks, making them computationally efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting. This distinct architecture and feature extraction capability contribute to their superior performance in image and video processing tasks. Initialize For some fixed number of iterations, or until some stopping criterion is met: ; For each training example Let Let If The perceptron algorithm is an online learning algorithm that operates by a principle called \"error-driven learning\". It iteratively improves a model by running it on training samples, then updating the model whenever it finds it has made an incorrect classification with respect to a supervised signal. The model learned by the standard perceptron algorithm is a linear binary classifier: a vector of weights w (and optionally an intercept term b , omitted here for simplicity) that is used to classify a sample vector x as class \"one\" or class \"minus one\" according to  where a zero is arbitrarily mapped to one or minus one. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces. Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others.

This paper proposes an intelligent image analysis framework to determine HPV status in digitized samples of oropharyngeal cancer tissue micro-arrays (TMA). We then extract relevant morphological measurements from those regions which are then input into a supervised learning model for the identification of HPV status. We also tested the performance of end-to-end deep learning classification methods to assess HPV status by learning directly from the original ISH processed images, rather than from the handcrafted features extracted from the segmented images. We examined the performance of sequential convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures including three popular image recognition networks (VGG-16, ResNet and Inception V3) in their pre-trained and trained from scratch versions, however their highest classification accuracy was inferior (78%) to the hybrid pipeline presented here.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

The EM algorithm addresses the challenges in estimating the Copas selection model by maximizing the observed likelihood based on the full likelihood. This is necessary because the observed data contain very little information on the latent variable. The EM algorithm iteratively maximizes the likelihood by estimating the latent variable and then updating the parameters based on the expectation of the complete data. The EM algorithm performs well in terms of avoiding the non-convergence problem that can occur when maximizing the observed likelihood under the Copas selection model. While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of the naÃ¯ve algorithm, further increasing the offset makes the error catastrophic. Consider the sample (109 + 4, 109 + 7, 109 + 13, 109 + 16). This is a serious problem with naÃ¯ve algorithm and is due to catastrophic cancellation in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm. We want to compare a model M1 where the probability of success is q = Â½, and another model M2 where q is unknown and we take a prior distribution for q that is uniform on [0,1].

The ABC algorithm, inspired by the behavior of honey bee swarms, is a simple and robust population-based optimization algorithm. The Genetic algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection. The gradient descent algorithm is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the parameters of a model to minimize a cost function. It computes the gradients of the cost function with respect to the parameters and updates the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent. In the study, the ABC algorithm showed better learning performance compared to the gradient descent algorithm. algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples. ; Gradient descent (alternatively, \"steepest descent\" or \"steepest ascent\"): A (slow) method of historical and theoretical interest, which has had renewed interest for finding approximate solutions of enormous problems. ; Subgradient methods: An iterative method for large locally Lipschitz functions using generalized gradients. ; Ellipsoid method: An iterative method for small problems with quasiconvex objective functions and of great theoretical interest, particularly in establishing the polynomial time \n\nInitialize For some fixed number of iterations, or until some stopping criterion is met: ; For each training example Let Let If The perceptron algorithm is an online learning algorithm that operates by a principle called \"error-driven learning\". It iteratively improves a model by running it on training samples, then updating the model whenever it finds it has made an incorrect classification with respect to a supervised signal. The training strategy used in the broad learning system (BLS) differs significantly from the mainstream neural network training strategy based on the gradient descent algorithm. Traditionally, neural networks are trained using the gradient descent algorithm, which involves updating the network's parameters based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to those parameters. This requires going through multiple iterations or epochs to iteratively adjust the parameters in order to minimize the error. In contrast, the BLS training strategy allows for rapid parameter updates without the need for a complete training cycle. It achieves this by utilizing dynamic update algorithms that perform update iterations on existing parameters. By applying pseudoinversion to the weight updating process, BLS can effectively update its parameters without going through a complete training cycle or relying solely on gradient-based optimization.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

This is in contrast to a discrete distribution, where the variable can only take on specific, distinct values. Continuous distributions are characterized by their probability density functions (PDFs), which describe the likelihood of observing different values of the variable. It is symmetrical and bell-shaped, with the majority of the data clustered around the mean. The distribution is defined by two parameters, the mean (Î¼) and the standard deviation (Ï), which determine the location and spread of the data points.

Two predictions derived from the model were tested and confirmed in a second round of experiments. Recent advances in high-throughput genomic technologies and computational methods allow us to formulate and test genetic network models without explicit data on molecular function. The most valid approach is to systematically evaluate the possible hypothetical network models against data and then select the most probable models for experimental validation. The probability of a genetic network model conditioned on the data can be calculated using Bayesian network methods. A Bayesian network is a graphic probabilistic model representing the dependence structure among multiple interacting variables , , . The probabilistic modelling provides a natural treatment for the stochastic aspects of biological processes and noisy measurements . Bayesian networks can be used to integrate prior knowledge and new data to capture and express causal relationships , , . We combined forward genetics and Bayesian network analysis to model the biological pathway of how Ctrq3 or polymorphisms in immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) confer susceptibility and resistance to Chlamydia infection in strains of mice with different genetic backgrounds. Blue lines indicate the likelihood-ratio statistic (LRS) that the phenotype is associated with the genomic locus. The colored lines following the trend of the LRS show the additive effect of the influence of the locus, with red lines indicating that D alleles increase trait values, while green alleles indicate that B alleles increase trait values. Significant (genome-wide adjusted p<0.05) and suggestive (adjusted p<0.63) QTLs are indicated by the solid red and grey lines, respectively.

The novel clinical prediction approach of Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences is created and applied to derive prognostic decision rules in cerebral aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The approach of Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences was applied to data from five trials of Tirilazad for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (3551 patients). Bayesian meta-analyses of observational studies on aSAH prognostic factors gave generalizable posterior distributions of population mean log odd ratios (ORs). Similar trends were noted in Bayesian and linear regression ORs. Significant outcome predictors include normal motor response, cerebral infarction, history of myocardial infarction, cerebral edema, history of diabetes mellitus, fever on day 8, prior subarachnoid hemorrhage, admission angiographic vasospasm, neurological grade, intraventricular hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm size, history of hypertension, vasospasm day, age and mean arterial pressure. Heteroscedasticity was present in the nontransformed dataset. Artificial neural networks found nonlinear relationships with 11 hidden variables in 1 layer, using the multilayer perceptron model. This aSAH prognostic system makes use of existing knowledge, recognizes unknown areas, incorporates one's clinical reasoning, and compensates for uncertainty in prognostication. Three of these include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and bayesian analysis [1â3]. These techniques complement classical or frequentist approaches, such as regression analysis. Artificial neural networks mimic biological neural systems. A signal summation is then sent as a spike of electrical current along an axon, with resultant discharge at the synapse, connecting it to other neurons. Examples of biological neural networks include the human brain and the human retina. Analogous to the biological system, artificial neural networks are made up of a group of input variables which converge on a number of nodes. Nodes are grouped in layers, with interconnection links among themselves. Hidden or latent variables can exist in one or two layers. After processing from different activation functions, output signals are then sent onto output nodes in the network. artificial neural networks assume all or none logic, that is, subjects are regarded as having or not having a diagnosis. Nodes in the neural nets are connected with each other via connection links. Neural networks are intelligent systems that can learn and change behaviour by themselves as they gain experience. In addition, they also take into account unobservable variables that the researcher is not aware of while designing the neural net. Assuming a basic artificial neural network with inputs, hidden or latent variables (in 1 layer), and an outputs, using a multilayer perceptron model as illustrated in Figure 1, output is equal to the summation of input to hidden layer, as well as hidden layer to output layer. Figure 1: Artificial Neural Network with 3 inputs, 2 hidden nodes and 2 outputs. If the activation function is the nonlinear hyperbolic tangent function, then, where hidden unit = hyperbolic tangent function Ã (bias term + sum of (weights from input unit to hidden unit Ã input unit)), and, where output = = bias term + sum of (weights on connection from hidden unit to output unit Ã hidden unit). Bayesian analysis allows the researcher to make use of existing states of knowledge before incorporation of new data. Simply put, it reflects the fact that knowledge is cumulative. Here, existing knowledge is expressed in the form of distributions (such as the normal bell-shaped distribution). The âpriorâ distribution is then combined with its likelihood of occurrence, forming a posterior probability. The end result (or posterior probability) represents a revised or updated belief after taking new data into account. If there is a lack of existing knowledge on the subject of interest, the researcher can still rely on Bayesian techniques. In this case, vague or uninformed prior probabilities are used. In the Bayesian approach to artificial neural networks , the goal is to find the predictive distribution for target values in the new test case/model, given inputs for that case and inputs/targets in training cases. Here, represents the probability of data according to a particular model. It is an integral, representing the summation of all possible parameter values weighted by the strength of belief (as assigned by the researcher) in these parameter values, or The probability of a new case/model given existing cases and associated parameters (, incorporating both weights and biases) is expressed as In general, Bayesian neural networks can be expressed as: Posterior probability density is proportional to product of prior probability density and its associated likelihood. Likelihood, as explained above, is the product of probabilities of data given parameters (weights and biases) as Fuzzy logic is an extension of neural nets, but with the distinct advantage that it can assume functions with any value from 0 to 1, accounting for the entire spectrum of certainty of diagnoses and spectrum of severity of diseases studied. The clinician can also clarify, or defuzzify, the entire process by carrying out crisp control actions, such as adding a cut-off level for prognoses and diagnoses, and trigger thresholds for treatment. By doing so, all actions (verification) in fuzzy logic are accounted for, and optimization is achievable. Thus, fuzzy logic systems are efficient ones. On the other hand, some regard this strength of fuzzy logic as a limitation. Unlike neural nets, where learning is done by the nets themselves as they gain experience from datasets, fuzzy logic systems cannot train themselves. The designer has to derive all action commands (in the form of âif-thenâ rules) manually, which is labour intensive with large datasets. When the degrees of various problems are combined in an equation, however, the resulting calculation may represent a more accurate prediction of the real data and individual patient. Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences can be represented as follows: where defuzz can be max-min, centroid, left of mean, right of mean, or another defuzzification crisp control action rule. We explore novel methods that account for existing states of knowledge (Bayesian meta-analysis and regression), complex nonlinear relationships between independent, latent, and dependent variables (artificial neural networks), and grey zones in prognoses (fuzzy Logic decision rules). Tirilazad aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage database is used to illustrate prognostic decision principles derived from a combination of techniques from multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, fuzzy Logic and bayesian analysis. Glasgow outcome score is a 5-point neurological scale with the following designations: 5: good recoveryânormal life activities despite minor deficits, 4: moderate disabilityâdisabled but independent, 3: severe disabilityâconscious but disabled, 2: persistent vegetative stateâunresponsive and speechless, and 1: death . Centers followed\n\n Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks). Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design. These DAGs can be represented as Bayesian networks. The joint probability distribution induced by the DAGs allows for the factorization of the distribution into conditional probability distributions, which in turn reveal conditional independence relationships among the variables forming a protein-coding unit. The use of high-throughput data in constructing these models helps validate the presence of a large fraction of these conditional independencies. When the sample correlation graph is structurally balanced, it naturally leads to a reduction of correlation and independence upon conditioning. Bayesian network analysis, logistic regression and elastic net were used to quantify the associations between acquisition and carriage of MRSA strains discriminated at 80% and 95% strain similarity thresholds and potentially modifiable resident characteristics including previous antibiotic exposure, comorbidity, medical devices, chronic wounds, functional and cognitive status and recent hospitalizations. The combination of Bayesian network analysis, logistic regression and elastic net can be used to identify associations between acquisition and carriage of MRSA strains and their potential risk factors in the face of scarce data. Previously, we used Markov chain models to predict the steady-state distribution of residents colonized with USA300 and non-USA300 MRSA and to assess the impact of potential risk factors on strain-specific acquisition of MRSA in community nursing homes . Furthermore, while our compartmental and stochastic models assumed that acquisition of one strain was independent from carriage of the other strain, whether this assumption holds in reality is not known. Bayesian networks have become an increasingly common method for modeling complex and uncertain data in many fields, including medicine [26â28]. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution between entities of interest, the number of which can be too large to be modeled successfully using traditional approaches (e.g., regression analysis) [29, 30]. The elastic net (ENET), a new regularization and variable selection method, is another novel approach that gains popularity in modeling scarce data with many predictors . In this study, we sought to use the combination of Bayesian networks, logistic regression and elastic net modeling to identify and quantify the associations between acquisition and carriage of MRSA strains and potentially modifiable resident characteristics in community nursing homes. A Bayesian network approach was used to examine the associations between candidate risk factors and acquisition and carriage of MRSA strains discriminated at the 80% and 95% strain similarity thresholds. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling and elastic net were subsequently applied to quantify the strength of the associations revealed by the network. The methods used to construct the data set employed in this study have been previously described . The static risk factors comprised comorbidity (Comorb), functional status (Func) and cognitive status (Cogn). The subjects with Charlson Comorbidity Index score â¥ 3, Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score < 2 and Minimum Data Set (MDS) Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) score â¥ 5 were classified at a severe level of the corresponding factor, and at a non-severe level otherwise.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Many machine learning algorithms are designed and applied for microarray classification problem which some of them provided fruitful results but due to the challenges of dealing with microarrays researchers are still working on designing more accurate, robust, and interpretable models for microarray classification. Furthermore, feature selection decreases the chance of overfitting and increases the chance of producing more understandable results. A set of top-ranked genes are selected as the output of these feature selection techniques. On the other hand, the multivariate filter methods like multiple hypothesis testing models [5, 6] consider the interconnection between features and are slower than univariate approaches. Supervised learning is a process in which the class labels of a set of instances are given and by applying a learning method, we build a classifier which can be used later in determining the class label of new instances. There are different ways of evaluating the performance of a classifier like using a separate test data, cross-validation, bootstrap sampling, and sub-sampling as surveyed and described in [7, 8]. Various classification models have been applied on microarrays like support vector machine (SVM) [11, 12], artificial neural network (ANN) , decision trees [10, 14], k nearest neighbors (KNN) , diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) . The reasons of its good performance are its ability in dealing with high dimensional problems, ability in dealing with noisy features, scalability, and its high generalization power. The internal nodes are associated with a splitting criterion which consists of a splitting attribute and one or more splitting predicates defined on this attribute. The construction of the decision tree is usually a two-phase process. In the first phase, the growing phase, an overgrown decision tree is built from the training data. The splitting criterion at each internal node is chosen to split the data sets into subsets that have better class separability, thus minimizing the misclassification error. They have many advantages that make them a suitable choice for microarray classification like scalability, fast setup, independence of input parameters, and generating rule-based models. Disadvantage of decision trees that appears in high dimensional problems like microarray classification is that they become overfitted easily [10, 14]. The basic idea of LDA is to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space such that the data points are reshaped to maximize the class separability. The optimal projection of classical LDA is obtained\n\nIndependence of observations â this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis. ; Normality â the distributions of the residuals are normal. ; Equality (or \"homogeneity\") of variances, called homoscedasticity â the variance of data in groups should be the same. We want to compare a model M1 where the probability of success is q = Â½, and another model M2 where q is unknown and we take a prior distribution for q that is uniform on [0,1]. The likelihood can be calculated according to the binomial distribution: (rather than averaging over all possible q). That gives a likelihood ratio of 0.1 and points towards M2. M2 is a more complex model than M1 because it has a free parameter which allows it to model the data more closely. The ability of Bayes factors to take \n\n A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience. Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30. Both the naÃ¯ve algorithm and two-pass algorithm compute these values correctly. Next consider the sample (108 + 4, 108 + 7, 108 + 13, 108 + 16), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample. While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of the naÃ¯ve algorithm, further increasing the offset makes the error catastrophic. Consider the sample (109 + 4, 109 + 7, 109 + 13, 109 + 16). This is a serious problem with naÃ¯ve algorithm and is due to catastrophic cancellation in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

The points that lie closest to this max-margin hyperplane are called the support vectors. The hyperplane can be defined using these points alone and the classifier only makes use of these support vectors to classify test samples. In the case that data points are not linearly separable in the input space, one solution is to map the input space into a higher dimensional feature space called kernel space .

The optimal projection of classical LDA is obtained\n\n Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization. factor of Îµ times the area of P by first finding an Îµ-net of P, counting the proportion of elements in the Îµ-net falling inside the region with respect to the rectangle P, and then multiplying by the area of P. The runtime of the algorithm depends only on Îµ and not P. One straightforward way to compute an Îµ-net with high probability is to take a sufficient number of random points, where the number of random points also depends only on Îµ. For example, in the diagram shown, any rectangle in the unit square containing at most three points in the 1/4-net has an area of at most 3/8 + 1/4 = 5/8. Îµ-nets also provide approximation algorithms for the NP-complete hitting set and set cover problems. points shown in the adjacent diagram is a 1/4-net of P, because any closed filled rectangle intersecting at least 1/4 of the unit square must intersect one of these points. In fact, any (axis-parallel) square, regardless of size, will have a similar 8-point 1/4-net. For any range space with finite VC dimension d, regardless of the choice of P, there exists an Îµ-net of P of size  because the size of this set is independent of P, any set P can be described using a set of fixed size. This facilitates the development of efficient approximation algorithms. For example, suppose we wish to estimate an upper bound on the area of a given region, that falls inside a particular rectangle P. One can estimate this to within an \n\nthe prediction of the silicon nitride (Si_3 N_4) layer thickness in the chemical vapor deposition process (CVD), using multivariate regression methods; ; the prediction of critical dimension in photolithography, using multi-level and regularization approaches; ; the prediction of layer width in etching. Depending on the accuracy of this virtual data, it can be used in modelling for other purposes, such as predicting yield, preventative analysis, etc. Another option to handle missing data is to use imputation techniques on the dataset, but virtual metrology in many cases, can be a more accurate method.
