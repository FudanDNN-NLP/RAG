If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of first-order logic is true for an \n\n In abstract algebra, a field extension L/K is called algebraic if every element of L is algebraic over K, i.e. if every element of L is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K. Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers. By using this assumption, it is proven that for all prime exponents p greater than or equal to 5, Fermat's equation (ap + bp + cp = 0) does not have non-trivial solutions over Q(sqrt(-2)) and Q(sqrt(-7)). In summary, Fermat's Last Theorem can be proven over Q(i) and Q(sqrt(-7)) when a specific conjecture in the Langlands programme is assumed. If a polynomial with rational coefficients is multiplied through by the least common denominator, the resulting polynomial with integer coefficients has the same roots. If its minimal polynomial has degree n, then the algebraic number is said to be of degree n. For example, all rational numbers have degree 1, and an algebraic number of degree 2 is a \n\n an extension field of K, and a ∈ E. If a is algebraic over K, then K(a), the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: K(a) is an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is not true. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice. An extension L/K is algebraic if and only if every sub K-algebra of L is a field.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.

Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group G of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup H of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: 0 + H, which are the even integers, and 1 + H, which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation). For a general subgroup H, it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { aH : a ∈ G }. A subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if the coset equality aN = Na holds for all a ∈ G. A normal subgroup of G is denoted N ◁ G.\n\n If A is a subgroup of G and B is a subgroup of H , then the direct product A × B is a subgroup of G × H . For example, the isomorphic copy of G in G × H is the product G × {1} , where {1} is the trivial subgroup of H . For example, if G is any non-trivial group, then the product G × G has a diagonal subgroup which is not the direct product of two subgroups of G . It is not true in general that every automorphism of G × H has the above form.

The fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that every finitely generated abelian group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.

Given an element &alpha; of E , let J&alpha; be the set of all polynomials f(x) in F[x] such that f(&alpha;) = 0 . The zero polynomial, all of whose coefficients are 0, is in every J&alpha; since 0&alpha;i = 0 for all &alpha; and i . If there are any non-zero polynomials in J&alpha; , then &alpha; is called an algebraic element over \n\n As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement \"every non-constant polynomial p(z) with real coefficients has a complex root\". Let a be the coefficient of zn in p(z) and let F be a splitting field of p(z) over C; in other words, the field F contains C and there are elements z1, z2, ..., zn in F such that  Then the coefficients of qt(z) are symmetric polynomials in the zi with real coefficients. Therefore, they can be expressed as polynomials with real coefficients in the elementary symmetric polynomials, that is, in \n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 4) ; x ≡ 5 (mod 6) 3+4j ≡ 5 (mod 6) 4j ≡ 2 (mod 6) 2j ≡ 1 (mod 3) j ≡ 2 × 1 (mod 3) j ≡ 2 (mod 3) x = 3 + 4(2 + 3k) x = 11 + 12k Consider the simple set of simultaneous congruences Now, for x ≡ 3 (mod 4) to be true, x = 3 + 4j for some integer j. After multiplying both sides with the inverse, we obtain: or For the above to be true: j = 2 + 3k for some integer k. Now substitute back into 3 + 4j and we obtain Expand: to obtain the solution x ≡ 11 (mod 12)\n\n [[image:Non solvable quintic.svg|right|thumb|For the polynomial , the lone real root is algebraic, but not expressible in terms of radicals. Van der Waerden cites the polynomial . Neither does it have linear factors modulo 2 or 3. It is known that a Galois group modulo a prime is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Galois group over the rationals.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.
