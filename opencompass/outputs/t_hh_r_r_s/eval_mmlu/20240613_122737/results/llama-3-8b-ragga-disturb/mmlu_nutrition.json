The rising rate of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is now one of the most grave public health challenges facing the US. However, underlying causes for this increase are unclear. This literature studies several of the factors that place low-income children at risk for developing obesity; psychological, environmental, and biological. The findings indicated that participant's weight was most influenced by family lifestyle and school environment factors. Obesity is a critical health problem that is increasing worldwide, and in the United States in particular. In the US, the percentage of children and teens affected by obesity has more than tripled since 1970's ( Irimia R, Gottschling M 2016). According to a survey conducted and published in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, seven states have self-reported obesity rates surpassing 35%, according to new data from the CDC, up from the comparison in 2012 in which all states were lower than 35% (Bridget Kuehn, MSJ, 2018). The concerns about the increasing prevalence of obesity are founded in the association between obesity and adverse health outcomes and increased health expenditures. Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of numerous comorbidities, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, asthma, and gallbladder disease. An alarming fact of this epidemic is that children are increasingly becoming obese. Data collected from the CDC during the years 2015-2016 show that nearly 1 in 5 school age children and young people (6 to 19 years) in the United States has obesity ( Irimia R, Gottschling M 2016). There is a magnitude of factors that lead children to overeat, make innutritious diet choices, and not exercise consistently. Of great concern is that children who are overweight or obese are also more likely to be overweight or obese as adults (Freedman Et Al., 2005; Wang, 2008). With the numerous medical concerns obesity causes, childhood obesity affects children's social and emotional health. Obese adolescents are often bullied and/or teased because they are overweight. The consequences of being an obese child tend to contribute to difficulty in weight management. Obese children shy away the public eye to protect themselves from negative comments and unwanted attention; retreating to safe places, such as their homes (Lobstein, T., Jackson-Leach, R., 2015). Environmental factors that include; low-income, lack of access to healthy food choices, and lack of resources within the confines of the community can definitely contribute to obesity. Low-income children are exposed to disproportionately more marketing and advertising for obesity-promoted products that encourage the consumption of unhealthful foods (fast food, sugar infested beverages) and discourage physical activity (television shows, video games) according to a report issued by the Institute of Medicine (2013). Obese children tend to have less hours of physical activity and spend more time using electronics. This inactive lifestyle combined with high caloric intake contributes to obesity. It is well documented that a large number of children with pediatric obesity have parents and or family who are obese as well. The underlying basis of obesity and eating disorders tend to lie in some grouping of psychosocial, environmental, and genetic attributes. eating disorder, depression, and anxiety) may have more trouble controlling their food intake, obtaining the adequate amount of exercise and maintaining a healthy\n\nThere are several factors that have contributed to the global increase in obesity rates, despite genetic influences playing a role. While genetics can predispose individuals to obesity, they cannot fully explain the significant rise in obesity rates seen worldwide. One factor that has contributed to the increase in obesity rates is changes in dietary patterns. The availability and affordability of high-calorie, processed foods have increased, leading to a higher consumption of unhealthy food choices. This shift towards a more calorie-dense diet, coupled with larger portion sizes and increased snacking, has contributed to excess calorie intake. Another factor is the sedentary lifestyle that many people lead today. Additionally, urbanization and changes in transportation patterns have played a role in the global increase in obesity rates. The complex interplay between genetic factors, environmental influences, cultural norms, socioeconomic status, and individual behaviors all contribute to the global rise in obesity rates. Overall, while genetic influences play a role in obesity, it is clear that shifts in dietary patterns towards high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization, and changes in transportation patterns are major contributors to the global increase in obesity rates. Reference:\n- Rush hour image: https://www.pexels.com/photo/bicycle-bike-cyclist-people-246912/\n\n Studies have shown that obesity has become increasingly prevalent in both people and animals such as pets and laboratory animals. There have been no linkages found between this obesity trend and diet and exercise. According to Professor Robert H. Lustig from the University of California, San Francisco, \"[E]ven those at the lower end of the body mass index (BMI) curve are gaining weight. The theory of environmental obesogens proposes a different causal facet to obesity – that lifetime exposure to xenobiotic chemicals may change the body's metabolic system. Chemical obesogens are molecules that do not properly regulate lipid metabolism in the body and could therefore promote \n\nThe contributing factors to the epidemic of diabetes and obesity in the United States can be attributed to several factors. One major factor is the consumption of inflammatory foods. This combination of toxic foods leads to chronic inflammation and ultimately, disease. Additionally, the easy availability and affordability of processed and fast foods play a significant role in the epidemic. These foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars, which contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to these conditions, making them more susceptible even with relatively healthy lifestyle choices. It is important to note that these factors are interrelated and can exacerbate each other. Addressing the epidemic requires a holistic approach that includes promoting a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, and raising awareness about the risks associated with diabetes and obesity. Some factors that contribute to the increasing rates of obesity in South Africa include:\n\n1. Unhealthy Diet: The consumption of processed and fast foods high in calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars has become more prevalent in South Africa. Socioeconomic Factors: Poverty and income inequality play a role in obesity rates. The availability of affordable, nutritious food options can be limited in low-income communities, leading to reliance on cheap, energy-dense foods that contribute to weight gain. Lack of Awareness and Education: Limited knowledge about nutrition and healthy lifestyles may contribute to unhealthy food choices and a lack of exercise. Inadequate access and safety concerns in these spaces may discourage exercise and contribute to obesity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about nutrition.

The reason for this is that a high number of people with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s have a supplement resistant anemia when using supplements and changing their diet not only doesn’t solve the problem but also can do more harm than good. A deficiency of either vitamin B12, folate (vitamin B9) or both due to intestinal malabsorption or autoimmunity are on the top list of causes of anemia in hypothyroid patients. While folate and B12 deficiency produce many similar symptoms the major difference is that the lack of vitamin B12 can cause neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy and balance difficulties due to spinal cord degeneration. Your stomach’s parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid and a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor. An adequate amount of hydrochloric acid and pepcin ensure the release of B12 from foods and the intrinsic factor binds vitamin B12 and enables its active absorption in the intestine. The most common type is when the antibodies are directed against the parietal cells causing them to atrophy, lose their ability to secret hydrochloric acid and produce intrinsic factor. In other forms of pernicious anemia the parietal cells are unaffected but antibodies are produced against the intrinsic factor itself and attach to it, thus preventing it from binding vitamin B12 and impair absorption. In another less common form of pernicious anemia, the antibodies allow vitamin B12 to bind to the intrinsic factor but prevent the absorption of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex by the ileal receptors of the intestine. This is the case with most autoimmune inflammatory bowl diseases such as Crohn’s and celiac disease. Food-cobalamin malabsorption could be also caused by autoimmune and non-autoimmune atrophic gastritis. In the absence of adequate amounts of acid, B12 remains protein-bound and passes throughout the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed. In the atrophic gastritis B12 vitamin couldn’t be extracted from the foods because of hypochlorhydria that occurs due to the damage to the cells of the stomach wall. Other causes of B12 malabsorbtion could include gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, partial or full gastrectomy, use of certain medication such as antacids and metformin, gastric or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), alcohol abuse, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, haptocorrine deficiency and ageing. Impaired B12 absorption through passive diffusion. About 1–5% of free or unbound B12 (crystalline cobalamin) is absorbed along the entire intestine by passive diffusion without the involvement of intrinsic factor. This type of absorption explains the mechanism underlying oral B12 treatment of cobalamin deficiencies with high dose medication and supplements. Malabsorption occurs when iron is poorly absorbed from the food in the small intestine. Many intestinal disorders such as insufficient production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and celiac disease can reduce your body’s ability to absorb and utilize iron. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Certain species of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus are more commonly found in people with abnormal gut flora. These bacteria have the ability to cause inflammation and use nutrients including iron by impairing their absorption. The only treatment modern medicine currently has to offer to patients with anemia is a replacement therapy for missing nutrients. Sprays and injections are used to bypass the digestive tract to reduce digestive symptoms associated with supplements. Methods: injection, B12 tablets or sublingual B12 supplementation, transdermal B12 patch, sublingual B12 spray and nasal spray. Alternative practitioners focus more on a combination approach by using supplements and/or adding more folate, iron- and B12-rich foods to your diet. However, fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C increase absorption of iron from meats and it is a good idea to include them into your diet. The most important factor that determines if your treatment will be successful or is going to fail is to know the exact cause of your anemia and understand the mechanism of B12, iron and folate absorption. If you have a type of B12 anemia when your intrinsic factor is affected you lose the ability\n\nAtrophic gastritis  is a process of chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa of the stomach, leading to a loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria. Type A gastritis primarily affects the body/fundus of the stomach and is more common with pernicious anemia.Type B gastritis primarily affects the antrum, and is more common with H. pylori infection. That said, symptomatic patients are mostly females and signs of atrophic gastritis are those associated with iron deficiency: fatigue, restless legs syndrome, brittle nails, hair loss, impaired immune function, and impaired wound healing. Although, atrophic gastritis impairs iron and vitamin B12 absorption, iron deficiency will be found at a younger age and many years before the development of pernicious anemia. Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) is due to environmental factors, such as diet and H. pylori infection. Patients with EMAG are also at increased risk of gastric carcinoma. The inadequate production of intrinsic factor also leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption and pernicious anemia.

The epidemiologic literature clearly suggests that the increased bioavailability of sex steroids that accompanies increased adiposity is strongly associated with risk of endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancers (Kaaks et al. Overweight women are known to have increased risk of endometrial cancer and breast cancer after menopause due to increased levels of circulating estrogen. Obesity is associated with increased insulin levels, which lead to increases in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activity and, in some individuals, an increased androgen production by the ovaries. Increased adiposity also increases aromatase activity, leading to increased levels of bioavailable oestrogen levels in postmenopausal women. 18.2\n\nEffect of obesity on hormones and endometrial cancer.

FHAD1 showed differential expression in patients diagnosed with endometriosis and obesity. While legislation has been enacted to require a minimum amount of time to pass before workers enter sprayed fields, the lack of legal and political power of many farm workers combined with the fact that enforcing such laws can be difficult, makes exposure to obesogens a possible threat to the livelihood of many farm work\n\n Various hereditary forms of obesity have been traced to defects in hypothalamic signaling (such as the leptin receptor and the MC-4 receptor) or are still awaiting characterization – Prader-Willi syndrome – in addition, decreased response to satiety may promote development of obesity. For example, ghrelin and leptin are released from the stomach and adipose cells, respectively, into the blood stream. Any changes in normal production levels of these two hormones can lead to obesity. Obesity is associated with increased insulin levels, which lead to increases in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activity and, in some individuals, an increased androgen production by the ovaries.

The total daily dose of Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) Injection to be infused depends on daily protein and caloric requirements and on the patient's metabolic and clinical response. After estimating the total daily fluid (water) requirements, the appropriate volume to be infused to meet the daily protein requirement of the patient, can be determined. Vitamins and trace minerals may be added to the amino acid/dextrose solution as needed. The total daily dose of amino acid/dextrose solution to be infused depends on daily protein requirements and on the patient's metabolic and clinical response. The daily determination of nitrogen balance and accurate body weights, corrected for fluid balance, are probably the best means of assessing individual protein requirements. The daily nutrient requirements of an average adult patient, not hypermetabolic, in an acceptable weight range and with restricted physical activity, are about 30 kcal/kg of body weight, 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen and between 2500 and 3000 mL of fluids. Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 calories — 1000 mL of Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose Injection will provide 5.6 grams of nitrogen and 850 calories. The infusion rate of Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) Injection should be 2 mL/min initially and may be gradually increased to deliver the required amounts of amino acids and calories. If nutrient administration falls behind schedule, under no circumstances should an attempt to “catch up” to planned intake be made. The rate of nutrient infusion is governed by the protein requirements and by the patient's glucose tolerance estimated by glucose levels in plasma and urine. In adults, hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the vena cava. A 3.5% amino acid solution is too concentrated for use in pediatric patients less than 1 year old, who generally require a 2.5% amino acid solution. However, older pediatric patients can receive Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) Injection. The suggested amino acid dosage level for children between 4 and 12 years of age is 2 g/kg/day; for 13 to 15 years of age, 1.7 g/kg/day; and for 16 years of age and above, 1.5 g/kg/day. Energy intake may be supplemented with intravenous fat emulsion. Administration of amino acid solution in the presence of impaired renal function may augment an increasing BUN, as does any protein dietary component. Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) Injection contains sodium hydrosulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. Aminosyn II 3.5% in 25% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) Injection is indicated for long-term total parenteral nutrition and whenever it is essential to provide, together with amino acids, adequate amounts of exogenous calories. * The existence of mechanisms for colonic salvage.Thus the intake of nitrogen from breast milk is relatively low, but the infant is able to maintain nitrogen balance by virtue of:\n\n  * The high quality of breast-milk protein (conventionally used as the reference for calculating the amino acid scores of alternative proteins – such as cow's milk or soya – used in infant formulas). * The amount of dietary solute in excess of the need for growth is known as the 'renal solute load' (RSL). * * *\n\nIn contrast, some pathways important to the metabolism of protein are less mature in the young infant, particularly if preterm. These apparent metabolic constraints possibly reflect the observation that the young infant is strongly anabolic and in health has little need to ­dispose of excessive amino acid. Thus the intake of nitrogen from breast milk is relatively low, but the infant is able to maintain nitrogen balance by virtue of:\n\n  * The high quality of breast-milk protein (conventionally used as the reference for calculating the amino acid scores of alternative proteins – such as cow's milk or soya – used in infant formulas). (The observation of a high level of non-protein nitrogen has caused some to observe that it is not appropriate to express the protein content of breast milk by applying the conventional factor of 6.25 to nitrogen measured using the Kjeldahl technique.A factor of 5.18 probably reflects more closely the nutritional protein content.) When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins, other biomolecules, or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are \n\nIn contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12).Humans must consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day because an equivalent amount of amino acids is oxidized or used for the synthesis of nonprotein compounds. The term nitrogen balance is a measure of the difference between protein intake and nitrogen loss (see Section 5 in Chapter 35). 34.10 Protein and amino acid content and turnover in a healthy adult. ### 4.2 Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids\n\nHumans cannot synthesize His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, or Val; therefore, these amino acids are called essential (or indispensable) amino acids. For growing children, this list has to be expanded; they must consume Arg because they commonly do not produce enough of it in the urea cycle (see Section 2.5 in Chapter 35) and Cys because they do not make enough of it from methionine (see Sections 4.1 and  in Chapter 36). Gln, Tyr, Gly, Pro, and ornithine are conditionally essential amino acids; that is, they are essential in certain disease conditions. For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12). In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For people who eat mostly a vegan diet, methionine is usually the limiting essential amino acid.Adults should consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day.For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum intake of 0.75 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day; this protein should have a good balance of amino acids. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is indicated for the nutritional support of infants (including those of low birth weight) and young children requiring TPN via either central or peripheral infusion routes. Parenteral nutrition with Aminosyn-PF 10% is indicated to prevent nitrogen and weight loss or treat negative nitrogen balance in infants and young children where (1) the alimentary tract by the oral gastrostomy, or jejunostomy route, cannot or should not be used or adequate protein intake is not feasible by these routes; (2) gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired; or (3) protein requirements are substantially increased as with extensive burns. Dosage, route of administration, and concomitant infusion of non-protein calories are dependent on various factors, such as nutritional and metabolic status of the patient, anticipated duration of parenteral nutrition support, and vein tolerance. For moderately catabolic or depleted patients in whom the central venous route is not indicated, diluted amino acid solutions mixed with 5 to 10% dextrose solutions may be infused by peripheral vein, supplemented, if desired, with fat emulsion. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, is an amino acid injection-pediatric formula not intended for direct infusion. The total daily dose of the solution depends on the daily protein requirements and on the patient's metabolic and clinical response. The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn-PF 10% is up to 2.5 g amino acid/kg/day for infants up to 10 kg. For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids/day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1.0 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg. Initial amino acid dosage levels of 1.0 g/kg/day may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 g/kg/day to approximate desired intake levels. Nonprotein calories should constitute approximately 100 to 130 kcal/kg/day. Part of the nonprotein caloric requirement may be provided as lipid emulsion administered concurrently to provide up to 60% of daily calories at a dose not to exceed 4 g fat/kg/day. Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged (more than 5 days) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid for infants, especially preterm infants with potentially immature enzyme pathways. Therefore, addition of a cysteine supplement to the TPN admixture is recommended. The intake of cysteine by the preterm infant ingesting maternal milk is approximately 78 mg/kg/day. The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn-PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP). Daily administration of intravenous vitamin supplements including a complete complement of fat and water-soluble vitamins is required. Bicarbonate should not be administered during infusion of the nutritional solution unless deemed absolutely necessary. Hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava. In addition to meeting protein needs, the rate of administration, particularly during the first few days of therapy, is governed by the patient's glucose tolerance. Daily intake of amino acids and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of glucose levels in blood and urine. The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture. Aminosyn -PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is supplied as a Pharmacy Bulk Package in 1000 mL flexible plastic containers List 4179. Local reactions consisting of erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids particularly if other substances, such as antibiotics, are also administered through the same site. FREQUENT EVALUATION AND LABORATORY DETERMINATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR PROPER MONITORING OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION. Studies should include blood sugar, serum proteins, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, hemogram, carbon dioxide content, serum osmolalities, blood cultures, and blood ammonia levels. It is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants. Conservative doses of amino acids should be given, dictated by the nutritional status of the patient. Should symptoms of hyperammonemia develop, amino acid dosage levels should be reduced and titrated against serum ammonia levels. The effect of infusion of amino acids, without dextrose, upon carbohydrate metabolism of children is not known at this time. It is essential to provide adequate exogenous dextrose calories concurrently with amino acids. Administration of amino acids without carbohydrates may result in the accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood. Correction of this ketonemia may be achieved by the administration of carbohydrate. The use of fat emulsion to provide 4 — 10% of total caloric intake as linoleic acid may prevent EFAD. Peripheral administration of Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) requires appropriate dilution and provision of adequate calories.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about nutrition.
