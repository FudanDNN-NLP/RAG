At the UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the French Republic, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There have been two seat changes since then, although these have not been reflected in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, as it has not been accordingly amended:  Additionally, France reformed its provisional government into the French Fourth Republic in 1946 and later into the French Fifth Republic in 1958, both under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle. France maintained its seat as there was no change \n\n  The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five sovereign states to whom the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The permanent members were all allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are also all states with nuclear weapons (though only the United States had developed nuclear weapons prior to the formation of the United Nations). The remaining 10 members of the council are elected by the General Assembly, giving a total of 15 UN member states. All five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any \"substantive\" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support. Most of the leading candidates for permanent membership are regularly elected onto the Security Council by their respective groups. In 2013, the P5 and G4 members of the UN Security Council accounted for eight of the world's ten largest defence budgets, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about us foreign policy.

The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of Marxism–Leninism, planned economy and a one-party state whilst the United States promoted the ideologies of liberal democracy and the free market in a capitalist market economy. This was reflected in the Warsaw Pact and NATO military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and the United States had generally been considered the two superpowers of the Cold War era; with the collapse of the Soviet Union, some began to label the United States as a \"hyperpower\". Political scientist Francis Fukuyama speculated that humanity had reached the \"end of history\" in that liberal, capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union and other Communist governments led to conflicts in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa. The United States countered with its own propaganda, describing its own society as free and the Soviet Union's as unfree. Realists, who concern themselves primarily with power politics, have generally blamed the Cold War on an aggressive, expansionist Soviet empire. Because realists believe that Arbenz was a Soviet puppet, they view his overthrow as the necessary rollback of communism in the Western Hemisphere. Revisionists, who place the majority of the blame for the Cold War on the United States, emphasize how Washington sought to expand overseas markets and promote foreign investment, especially in the Third World. Revisionists allege that because the State Department came to the rescue of the UFCO, the U.S. intervention in Guatemala represents a prime example of economic imperialism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about us foreign policy.

In summary, the sociopolitical climate during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency created a synergy of highly conducive historical circumstances and individual exceptionality that contributed to the emergence and early success of Carl Rogers' client-centered therapy. The deep societal distress of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt's leadership style, the values promoted by the New Deal, and the recognition of the importance of mental health during wartime all played significant roles in establishing an environment favorable for the expression of Rogers' therapy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declares the \"Good Neighbor policy\", US opposition to armed intervention in inter-American affairs. ; 1935 – Neutrality Act of 1935; when war breaks out prohibits all arms shipments (allowing shipment of oil, steel, chemicals); US citizens can travel on belligerent ships only at their own risk ; 1936 – Neutrality Act of 1936; no loans to belligerents ; 1936 – Spanish Civil War; US neutral; American Catholics support Nationalist forces; left-wing elements support Republican forces ; 1937 – \n\n By late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" for Britain and other countries. Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain, and China. As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible \n\n preserve his political capital for his domestic agenda. In 1936, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, though they never coordinated their strategies. Roosevelt saw the threat that these rising powers posed, but focused instead on reviving the U.S. economy during the early part of his presidency. Hitler and other world leaders, meanwhile, believed that the U.S. would be reluctant to intervene in world affairs. They saw the U.S. withdrawal from Latin America, the Neutrality Acts, and the 1934 Tydings–McDuffie Act, which promised independence to the Philippines after \n\nDuring both the Great Depression and World War II, Franklin Roosevelt garnered popular support due to a variety of factors. Firstly, his leadership style and communication skills played a crucial role in winning the public's confidence. Roosevelt was known for his ability to connect with the American people through his fireside chats, where he explained his policies and reassured citizens during times of crisis. Secondly, Roosevelt's implementation of various economic recovery programs, such as the New Deal, helped alleviate the hardships faced by the American people during the Great Depression. His administration's efforts in creating war industries, implementing rationing, and promoting patriotism fostered a sense of solidarity among citizens. Regarding the role of economic class in shaping support, it is noteworthy that Roosevelt's approval ratings during peacetime were divided along class lines. Overall, Roosevelt's popular support was influenced by his leadership, effective communication, and the tangible impact of his policies in alleviating the hardships of the Great Depression.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about us foreign policy.

Racial demographic disparities in healthcare access are also present in rural areas, with Native Americans living in rural areas in particular receiving inadequate medical care. Proposed solutions to US health care deserts include the enactment of a national single payer health care system; adoption of a public option under the Affordable Care Act (ACA); the approval of higher Medicare reimbursements and tax credits for struggling hospitals; the establishment of strategically placed free-standing emergency centers; the expansion of telehealth and telemedicine to remote areas; and increased incentives to recruit doctors to practice in rural and underserved areas. Rural residents may live on farms, ranches and Indian reservations far from a hospital, forcing residents to take several hours or an entire day off work to drive to a doctor's appointment or follow up care, making rural residents less likely to seek treatment. In addition to the challenges of graying, declining and poverty-stricken populations, as well as the preference of privately insured patients to seek treatment at newer hospitals further away, the report said corporate profit-driven decisions, as opposed to local community needs, shuttered the doors of rural hospitals in underserved areas. Federal health officials predicted in 2019 that the number of rural doctors, half of them over 50 years of age, would decline by 23 percent during the next ten years. A contributing factor to this decline is newly graduated doctors' reluctance to move to rural areas. While doctors originally from rural areas are more likely to return to rural areas to practice, rural Americans are less likely to attend medical school in the first place. Newly graduated doctors have also tended to prefer jobs in hospitals, rather than jobs in family practices that are more common in rural areas. The lack of entertainment or food diversity, fear of prejudice, and reduced financial prospects associated with rural regions have been cited as factors leading to medical students' reluctance to practice in rural regions, as well as the unique difficulties associated with practice rural healthcare. In July, 2019, the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board representing 18 tribal communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, took over the Rapid City's Sioux San Hospital, where, according to government investigators, patients died as a result of misdiagnoses and treatment by staff members not screened for hepatitis and tuberculosis.

One significant factor is the specific institutional arrangements in the United States that fail to effectively redistribute income and have allowed the pressures of globalization to be fully realized. This shift in institutional arrangements over the past two decades has had divergent consequences for those at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic hierarchy. Additionally, the legacy of racism in the United States has played a role in shaping the country's political economy. When leaders in the Democratic party sought to include African Americans in the benefits of Roosevelt's New Deal, support for economic populism waned in the middle and working classes. This resulted in a loss of support for policies that may have helped reduce inequality. Furthermore, the advantage of wealth is further enhanced by a political system in which those with money are better able to have their interests served legislatively than the poor or working classes. This unequal political influence can perpetuate policies that favor the wealthy, exacerbating inequality. It is important to note that while the distribution of income before taxes in the United States may not be more unequal than other nations, after taxes it is considerably less egalitarian. This suggests that the inequitable tax system in the US also contributes to greater inequality compared to other developed nations. In summary, the greater inequality experienced in the United States compared to other developed nations in the context of globalization can be attributed to specific institutional arrangements that fail to redistribute income effectively, a legacy of racism influencing the country's political economy, and a political system that favors the interests of the wealthy. In 1894, a wave of agrarian unrest swept through the cotton and tobacco regions of the South. The most dramatic impact came in North Carolina, where the poor white farmers who comprised the Populist party formed a working coalition with the Republican Party, then largely controlled by blacks in the low country, and poor whites in the mountain districts. They took control of the state legislature in both 1894 and 1896, and the governorship in 1896. The state legislature lowered property requirements, expanding the franchise for the white majority in the state as well as for blacks. In 1895, the Legislature rewarded its black allies with patronage, naming 300 \n\n the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to \"angry old white men\" who would soon be demographically displaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. However, according to the Eurobarometer in 2016 to 2018, over 60% of Europeans between 15 and 24 viewed globalization positively, in stark contrast with older cohorts. A 2018 YouGov poll asked British voters whether leaving the European Union was a good idea in \n\nThe United States has many regions which have been described as medical deserts, regions with inadequate access to one or more kinds of medical services. Although concentrated in rural regions, health care deserts also exist in urban and suburban areas, particularly in Black majority census tracts in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City.

The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States. Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor. As U.S. President, it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the domestic economy ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France — funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on \n\n via loans, which only continued to cripple economies that had been destroyed or left alone during conflict.
