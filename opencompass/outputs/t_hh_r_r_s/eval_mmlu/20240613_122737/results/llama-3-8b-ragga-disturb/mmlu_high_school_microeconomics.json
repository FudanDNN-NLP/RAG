Convergence to Nash equilibrium: It has been proven that if all players adhere to the dynamics, the states of players will reach consensus with high probability, and the joint action profile of players will be absorbed into a Nash equilibrium of the game. This ensures that the dynamics lead to a stable outcome where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy. However, this does not provide any justification for the case when players are individual agents. Later, Aumann and Brandenburger (1995), re-interpreted Nash equilibrium as an equilibrium in beliefs, rather than actions. For instance, in rock paper scissors an equilibrium in beliefs would have each player believing the other was equally likely to play each strategy. This interpretation weakens the descriptive power of Nash equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock in each play of the game, even though over time the probabilities are those of the mixed strategy. This game has no pure-strategy equilibrium, because one player or the other would deviate from any profile of strategies—for example, (Left, Left) is not an equilibrium because the Kicker would deviate to Right and increase his payoff from 0 to 1. If \n\n A large body of work in experimental game theory has documented systematic departures from Nash equilibrium, the cornerstone of classic game theory. The lack of empirical support for Nash equilibrium led Nash himself to return to doing research in pure mathematics. Selten, who shared the 1994 Nobel Prize with Nash, likewise concluded that “game theory is for proving theorems, not for playing games”. M equilibrium is motivated by the desire for an empirically relevant game theory. M equilibrium accomplishes this by replacing the two main assumptions underlying classical game theory, perfect maximization and rational expectations, with the weaker notions of ordinal monotonicity –players' choice probabilities are ranked the same as the expected payoffs based on their beliefs – and ordinal consistency – players' beliefs yield the same ranking of expected payoffs as their choices. M equilibria do not follow from the fixed-points that follow by imposing rational expectations and that have long dominated economics. ; Number of pure strategy Nash equilibria: A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies which represents mutual best responses to the other strategies. In other words, if every player is playing their part of a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change his or her strategy. Considering only situations where players play a single strategy without randomizing (a pure strategy) a game can have any number of Nash equilibria.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

If, in contrast to the previous example, the consumer is inelastic, they will demand the same quantity no matter the price. Because the producer is elastic, the producer is very sensitive to price. Because the consumer is inelastic, the quantity doesn't change much. Because the consumer is inelastic and the producer is elastic, the price changes dramatically. Technically, it displays a negative cross elasticity of demand and that demand for it increases when the price of another good decreases. If A is a complement to B , an increase in the price of A will result in a negative movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift inward; less of each good will be demanded. This is in contrast to a substitute good, whose demand decreases \n\n The following example shows that, when the open graph property does not hold, equilibrium may fail to exist. There is an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas. There are two agents with identical endowments (1,1). They have identical preferences, based on lexicographic ordering: for every vector represents a complete and transitive relation, but it does not have an open graph. Now there are two cases: if the price of bananas is 0, then both agents can afford the bundle (1,2) which is strictly better than their allocation. If the price of bananas is some p > 0 (where the price of apples is normalized to 1), then both agents can afford the bundle (1+p, 0), which is strictly better than their allocation. ; A positive income elasticity of demand is associated with normal goods; an increase in income will lead to a rise in quantity demanded. The most commonly used elasticity in economics, the price elasticity of demand, is almost always negative, but many goods have positive income elasticities, many have negative.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

The emissions fee and cap and trade systems are both incentive-based approaches to solving a negative externality problem. They provide polluters with market incentives by increasing the opportunity cost of polluting, thus forcing them to internalize the externality by making them take the marginal external damages of their production into account. is an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers. Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause. Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality \n\n The negative externalities seem to be the most obvious to confirm, since the driver does not take into account, for example, the negative effects of air pollution on third parties, when they opt to drive their car. externalities are relevant for Pareto efficiency. This inefficiency is particularly relevant in financial economics. When some agents are subject to financial constraints, then changes in their net worth or collateral that result from pecuniary externalities may have first order welfare implications. The consideration of these externalities – particularly the negative ones – is a part of transport economics. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, safety hazards, community severance and congestion. Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a public good.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

They argue that this causes inefficiencies in the market place, such as unnecessarily high prices to consumers for the good or service being supplied. It has been argued that government-imposed price caps might avert this problem. For this reason, firms might jointly raise prices above the equilibrium or competitive level by coordination between themselves. Firms operating in a market of low product differentiation might not coordinate with others, which increases the incentive to cheat the collusion agreement. While monopolies, for example, can be considered a market failure as prices rise and output falls, monopoly creation is not always a strict market phenomena. This may occur because of incentives facing voters, government officials, and government employees, because of actions by special interest groups that can impose costs on the general public, or because social goals other than economic efficiency are being pursued.

When workers are offered higher wages, they are more motivated and satisfied with their job, which can lead to increased productivity. Higher wages can also attract and retain skilled workers, reducing turnover and allowing for a more stable and experienced workforce. In the context of the supply chain network, increasing wages can help address labor shortages by making the job more attractive to potential workers. Furthermore, higher wages can incentivize workers to put in extra effort and be more committed to their work. For example, when workers are paid higher wages, they have more purchasing power, which can stimulate consumer demand for the products being supplied. However, it is important to consider the bounds on wage increases and conduct sensitivity analysis. While paying higher wages can have positive effects, there is a limit to the extent of wage increases that can be sustained by the firms in the supply chain network. In summary, increasing wages in the supply chain network can enhance labor productivity by motivating workers, attracting skilled employees, and reducing turnover. However, careful analysis of wage bounds is necessary to determine the sustainable range of wage increases. This affects both workers and investors (in dominant firms). ; decline of unions – Unions helped increase wages, benefits and working conditions. ; social norms – Social norms constrained executive pay. Economic inequality is also a result of difference in income. Factors that contribute to this gap in wages are things such as level of education, labor market demand and supply, gender differences, growth in technology, and personal abilities. The continued prevalence of \n\nWage taxes can have a significant impact on the competition between firms for highly skilled CEOs in an international labor market. According to a study on the impact of taxes on competition for CEOs, it is shown that wage taxes can greatly influence the outcome of such a competition, especially when marginal tax rates differ across countries. If a country has higher wage tax rates compared to another country, it creates an imbalance in the attractiveness of job offers for highly skilled CEOs. However, the impact of increasing wage tax rates unilaterally can have an ambiguous effect on observed gross compensation levels. It means that while increasing wage taxes may reduce the net compensation for CEOs, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a proportional decrease in the gross compensation offered by firms. In a local labor market for CEOs, where tax rates are consistent within the same country, observed gross fixed salaries are expected to decline as the wage tax rate increases. Understanding the impact of tax differentials and incentives is essential for analyzing the dynamics of this competition and for designing effective compensation strategies for attracting top talent.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

Bioremediation Biofilms can consist of a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and algae which are able to absorb, immobilize, and degrade many common pollutants found in wastewater. By harnessing a natural phenomenon, biofilm-mediated remediation is an environmentally friendly method for environmental cleanup. Heavy metals— such as lead, copper, manganese, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, iron, and nickel—form complexes with negatively charged functional groups in the EPS and become trapped. This includes suspended solids, pathogens, and organic compounds increasingly found in agricultural, industrial, hospital, and household wastewater. In particular, this wastewater has many suspended, colloidal, and dissolved particles including lactose, proteins, and lipids. Moving-bed biofilm reactors In moving-bed biofilm reactors, biofilms grow on small plastic or sponge-based carriers that circulate in the bioreactors using aeration or mechanical stirring. However, this also requires an increase in stirring or aeration and thus an increase in energy usage. Traditionally, algal biofuel production has high operating costs but can be combined with wastewater treatment to be more economical. As microalgae proliferate, they degrade the organic contaminants in the wastewater. For municipal wastewater treatment, these reactors can be vertical, horizontal, flow lane, or rotating. Biofilm consisting of microalgae cells grow on supports made of nylon, polyethylene, cotton, or other materials. There are still challenges with controlling conditions to optimize microalgae growth and potential contamination of wastewater with pathogens. The wastewater may also need to be pretreated by, for example, adding other nutrients like carbon and silicon. It is still unclear the cost of this technology and how it can handle varying conditions of wastewater (e.g. Chemical Production Biofilms are also being considered for producing bulk chemicals using biofilm fermentation, which is a type of biorefinery. Some products such as high fructose corn syrup and the commodity chemical acrylamide are manufactured using immobilized biocatalysts. These factors can make it challenging to use immobilized biocatalysts to produce bulk chemicals and fuels that often have a low market price. Strains of bacteria that are known for producing the chemical of interest are grown on carriers that can be made from a variety of materials. For example, zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on plastic and plastic-composite supports have been investigated for increasing ethanol yield. For some low-value bulk chemicals that do not require sterile conditions, this feature can be taken advantage of by using a mix of microbes which may improve the overall yield. By contrast, excessive biomass growth can also clog bioreactors, leading to downtime for maintenance and a loss in profit. Electrochemically active biofilms Electrically active microorganisms create electrochemically active biofilms (EABs) which have been used in microbial fuel cells to generate an electric current. These fuel cells have also been paired with wastewater treatment by taking advantage of the many biodegradable organic components in wastewater. Researchers have looked at treating dairy, animal carcass, brewery, winery, and domestic wastewater, to name a few, with microbial fuel cells. This technology,\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a thermoplastic polymer that has various common uses. One of the most significant applications of PVC is in the construction industry, where it is used for products such as vinyl siding, window profiles, and plumbing fixtures. PVC is favored in construction due to its low cost and ease of assembly. It has been increasingly replacing traditional materials like wood, concrete, and clay. Apart from construction, PVC is also utilized in other industries. It is commonly found in magnetic stripe cards, gramophone records (commonly known as vinyl records), and pipe systems for water and sewer pipelines. To make PVC softer and more flexible, plasticizers are added to the material. The most widely used plasticizers for PVC are phthalates. This modified form of PVC can then be used in various products such as clothing, upholstery, flexible hoses and tubing, flooring materials, roofing membranes, and electrical cable insulation. It's worth noting that while PVC has widespread use and benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and versatility, there have been concerns about its impact on the environment and human health. However, advancements are being made to address these concerns through the development of alternative materials or improved production processes. Overall, PVC finds extensive use across different industries due to its properties as a thermoplastic polymer. Its ability to be made softer and more flexible with the addition of plasticizers further expands its range of applications in various products. Protected cultivation using greenhouses expanded rapidly over a short period. The Income Increase Program for Farmers and Fishers (IIPFF) was initiated by the Agricultural Ministry of Korea, which resulted in the rapid expansion of plastic film greenhouses in the late 1970s. Protected cultivation was enabled by the development of the oil and steel industries. South Korea is not an oil producing country. As a result, all plastic films were imported until the 1960s. Greenhouse vegetable production in winter became popular in 1970 only after the petrochemical industry began to produce and distribute low cost plastic films. The production of steel coil from POSCO, established in 1973, made it possible to use steel instead of bamboo for \n\n for rapid prototyping, before mass production methods are employed. Volkswagen uses 3D printers on their assembly lines to print tooling, jigs and fixtures. They estimate that 3D printers save 250,000 EURO per year in costs. One report estimates that almost 75% of desktop 3D printers made are used in industry and not by consumers. Military and defense are also incorporating the use of 3D printers. The Royal Netherlands Air Force is using desktop 3D printers at their Woensdrecht Air Force Base to make fixtures and alignment tools. In the United States, the Hill Air Force base is using 3D printed parts in repair of fighter jets. This phenomenon of enhanced resistance can be beneficial in industrial chemical production where microorganisms within biofilms may tolerate higher chemical concentration and act as robust biorefineries for various products.

This includes suspended solids, pathogens, and organic compounds increasingly found in agricultural, industrial, hospital, and household wastewater. In particular, this wastewater has many suspended, colloidal, and dissolved particles including lactose, proteins, and lipids. Moving-bed biofilm reactors In moving-bed biofilm reactors, biofilms grow on small plastic or sponge-based carriers that circulate in the bioreactors using aeration or mechanical stirring. However, this also requires an increase in stirring or aeration and thus an increase in energy usage. Traditionally, algal biofuel production has high operating costs but can be combined with wastewater treatment to be more economical. As microalgae proliferate, they degrade the organic contaminants in the wastewater. For municipal wastewater treatment, these reactors can be vertical, horizontal, flow lane, or rotating. Biofilm consisting of microalgae cells grow on supports made of nylon, polyethylene, cotton, or other materials. There are still challenges with controlling conditions to optimize microalgae growth and potential contamination of wastewater with pathogens. The wastewater may also need to be pretreated by, for example, adding other nutrients like carbon and silicon. It is still unclear the cost of this technology and how it can handle varying conditions of wastewater (e.g. Chemical Production Biofilms are also being considered for producing bulk chemicals using biofilm fermentation, which is a type of biorefinery. Some products such as high fructose corn syrup and the commodity chemical acrylamide are manufactured using immobilized biocatalysts. These factors can make it challenging to use immobilized biocatalysts to produce bulk chemicals and fuels that often have a low market price. Strains of bacteria that are known for producing the chemical of interest are grown on carriers that can be made from a variety of materials. For example, zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on plastic and plastic-composite supports have been investigated for increasing ethanol yield. For some low-value bulk chemicals that do not require sterile conditions, this feature can be taken advantage of by using a mix of microbes which may improve the overall yield. By contrast, excessive biomass growth can also clog bioreactors, leading to downtime for maintenance and a loss in profit. Electrochemically active biofilms Electrically active microorganisms create electrochemically active biofilms (EABs) which have been used in microbial fuel cells to generate an electric current. These fuel cells have also been paired with wastewater treatment by taking advantage of the many biodegradable organic components in wastewater. Researchers have looked at treating dairy, animal carcass, brewery, winery, and domestic wastewater, to name a few, with microbial fuel cells.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

Now when an individual shop applies that new opening hours, though it has to pay more work, it can gain higher sales and thereby more profit.

For example, a firm cannot build an additional factory in the short run, but this restriction does not apply in the long run. Because forecasting introduces complexity, firms typically assume that the long-run costs are based on the technology, information, and prices that the firm faces currently. The long-run cost curve does not try to anticipate changes in the firm, the technology, or the industry. It only reflects how costs would be different if there were no constraints on changing the inputs in the current period. An \n\n Consider the assembly of a car: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If engine installation takes 20 minutes, hood installation takes five minutes, and wheels installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes. In an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When a station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, three cars can be operated on at the same time, each at a different stage of assembly.

It postulates that in a perfectly competitive market, the unit price for a particular good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity.

Several orange juice manufacturers have developed versions of their products that are lower in acid, which might irritate ulcers and colitis less than the regular products. A more detailed example is a simplified efficient market with two wines, an American wine and a German wine. In December, most consumers will put exactly twice as much value on the trendier wine than the non-trendy wine; there is a 50/50 chance that either wine will become the trendy one in December. Thus, the wines are equally likely to trade 1:2 or 2:1 in December. Most consumers care about the nationality only insofar as it influences which wine is trendy.

Analyzing the case of the trendy consumers, who are indifferent to the nationality apart from its trendiness, is more complex. Such a consumer, if in possession of American wine, might fallaciously reason: \"I currently have 1 American wine. If I trade for a German wine, I will have an expected value of 1.25 American wines. Therefore, I will be better off on average if I adopt a strategy to temporarily trade away, as the American loyalist did.\" However, this is similar \n\n German wine and is likewise indifferent to trendiness.

Since a competitive market has many competing firms, a customer can just easily buy widgets from any of the competing firms. Each firm in a competitive market will have buyers for its product as long as the firm charges \n\n A perfectly competitive firm faces a demand curve that is infinitely elastic. The difference between perfect competition and imperfect competition can be observed when the marginal cost curve is horizontal (perfect elasticity). Unlike under perfect competition, when the tax burden will be on consumer, in the case of imperfect competition the supplier and consumer will share the burden. The marginal revenue is positive, but it is lower than the price associated with it because lowering the price will: Samuelson indicates this point on the consumer demand curve is where the price is equal to one over one plus the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand. This rule does not apply to competitive firms \n\n A market with perfect competition is very rare. Producers choose the level of output, at which marginal cost equals marginal revenue. After taxation, the marginal cost curve shifts to the left to reach a new equilibrium characterized by lower quantity and higher price than before (that is given by the downward slope of the demand curve and marginal revenue curve).

Capital formation is essential for productivity enhancement and technological advancement, which are crucial for sustainable economic growth. It allows countries to take advantage of their comparative advantages and access larger markets, leading to increased economic growth. While financial economists use the word investment to refer to the acquisition and holding of potentially income-generating forms of wealth such as stocks and bonds, macroeconomists usually use the word for the sum of fixed investment—the purchasing of a certain amount of newly produced productive equipment, buildings or other productive physical assets per unit of time—and inventory investment—the accumulation of inventories over time. This is one of the major types of expenditure in an economy, the others being consumption expenditure, government expenditure, and expenditure on a country's export goods by people outside the country. Similarly, while financial economists use the word capital to refer to funds used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services, macroeconomists and microeconomists use the term capital to mean productive equipment, buildings or other productive physical assets. As with the term investment, the everyday usage of capital coincides with its use by financial economists.

In spaying, the veterinarian makes an incision in the abdominal wall, removes the uterus and ovaries, then stitches the incision. Neutering benefits include protection from prostatitis and testicular tumors, as well as reduction of undesirable behaviors, including aggression toward other male dogs, desire to roam, urine marking and inappropriate mounting. Spaying benefits can include a lowered risk for mammary tumors, reproductive bleeding, uterine tumors and infection. The American Veterinary Medical Association offers a list of the benefits of spaying and neutering. Neuticles.com offers a detailed description of the product. Most animal shelters and humane societies include spaying or neutering in the adoption fee. But lower cost sometimes means an assembly-line approach is used, so the dog might not get as much attention or recovery time. Spay/USA has a referral service for reduced cost spay and neuter clinics. In rare cases, such as with programs that use veterinary students, spaying and neutering can be free. Because of breed-specific legislation where some local governments require pit bulls be altered, free programs for this breed are becoming more common.

The challenges in smoking cessation and how evidence based strategies could be helpful for aiding Mrs Beecham in smoking cessation would be discussed as well. For a person with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, continuous exposure to smoking in the form of active and passive smoking would result in an enhanced predisposition for cardiovascular events (King et al, 2012). Current research studies show that cigarette smoking would lead to oxidative stress and the oxidative stress would lead cardiovascular events. Smoking is also not just an independent risk factor as attributed to its cardiovascular effects CVD; it also has multiple interactive effects on increasing the risks of Coronary Heart Disease CHD, peripheral arterial disease PAD, aortic aneurysm and also cerebrovascular diseases. These two estimates are what are used to understand the increase in risks occurrence with advancing age. The sudden death risk is higher for current smokers than they are with smokers who are abstaining for a longer time. Even with people who had no history of CVD, it was established in research that smoking alone could be a significant risk factor for sudden death, and in the case of Mrs Beecham, she has both a history of CVD and also smokes (Zuo et al, 2014). Cigarette smokers with a history of CVD are at a higher risk for stroke. The number of cigarettes that were smoked were seen to correspond proportionally to the risk elevations (Shinton & Beevers 1989). When cigarette smokers stopped smoking, within two years, the risk declined. However, she has not stopped smoking completely and unless this is achieved she would still be risk prone. The support staff are usually involved in providing the materials to make the specified menu. This is seen in the recent shift of the company towards developing healthier option. To conclude, when I worked in McDonalds, we were able to deliver the services that was expected and the food produced were uniform. I felt that the company was a market oriented company that falls under the adhocracy model of the Mintzberg framework. From this experience and analysis, I was able to experience the impact of this particular organizational culture. These aspects can help the patient obtain better motivation and to look forward to getting well. It becomes important for him to ensure that there is sufficient care which he takes in order to help his health improve (Russell, 2015). In case of developing a situation analysis, it would help the nurse be better prepared for the situation and conversation. These aspects help develop a strong level of growth among patients with regard to understanding of their situation and being able to deal with it (LoBiondo-Wood & Haber, 2005). Nursing as a profession involves focused empathy. It requires understanding the situation of the patient and helping him take better care of himself. Moreover, there is a need to ensure that the patient is motivated and not depressed at all times in order to provide sustainable treatment and health care (Schultz, 2014). If this does not occur, then it is quite likely that the patient would lose faith and be frustrated soon. Moreover, it is essential that there be an effective level of understanding about the level of illness of the patient which in this case is severe. It becomes essential to explain to the patient the need for taking care of himself, and what would be the all effects of over exertion in case of chronic pain due to spinal stenosis, and degeneration of the left hip (Schultz, 2014). Nurses with formal education are better capable of performing well and ensuring higher accuracy in dealing with patients as well as managing health care issues, and so a qualified and experienced nurse are essential for this case and its resolution (Orem, Taylor & Renpenning, 1995). These factors contribute towards the demand of a product.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

If the average daily usage rate of a material is 50 units and the lead-time is seven days, then: Reorder level = Average daily usage rate x Lead time in days = 50 units per day x 7 days = 350 units When the inventory level reaches 350 units an order should be placed for material.

Under a budget-balanced sharing scheme, however, the team members cannot be incentivized this way. This requires that the team members promise fixed payments to an \"Anti-Sharer\", as demonstrated by Kirstein and Cooter. The article derives conditions under which internal Anti-Sharing induces the team members to spend more effort than a budget-balanced sharing contract. α*P(public)/P(else) = MRS(person1) (1-ɑ)*P(public)/P(else)= MRS(person2) MC(public)/MC(else)=[P(public)/P(else)]=MRT We assume that there are two goods in an economy:the first one is a \"public good\", and the second is \"everything else\". The price of the public good can be assumed to be Ppublic and the price of everything else can be Pelse. So the privately optimal decision is to not rent a panel. If enacted, the policy would cost each household $400 per year. The total damage each household would avoid each year if the policy were enacted—the household's annual benefit from policy enactment—would be 100 x $6 = $600. So the voting mechanism causes each household to internalize the entire $600 yearly benefit to society of purchasing a panel, and the incentive is for households to vote in favor of the socially optimal policy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

In the simple textbook model of a competitive market, prices approximate the cost of production, but this is not necessarily the case when prices are administered. Because of the market share represented by the program, the great majority of physicians choose to take the government’s price rather than leave the program. The principal problem with administered prices arises because someone must set them and that person has an imperfect knowledge of cost. If the regulator sets the price below cost, the service may not be available or, if it is, will have to be cross-subsidized from a profitable service. If the price is set above cost, there may well be excess entry and too many services being offered on too small a scale.Not only do new goods and services appear continually, but physicians often become more skilled at delivering a service that is already available or at developing new tools to deliver that service at a different (and frequently lower) cost.For example, cataract surgery, which took upward of 8 h when first introduced, can now be completed in <30 min. And if firms are constrained by excess supply in the goods market, limiting how much goods they can sell, then their effective demand for labor will be less than their notional demand for labor. The presence of excess demand in one market influences effective demand or supply in another market, which may influence the degree of disequilibrium in the latter market; in turn, the constraints imposed on participants in that market influence their effective demand or supply in the former market. There is an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas. They have identical preferences, based on lexicographic ordering: for every vector represents a complete and transitive relation, but it does not have an open graph. This economy does not have an equilibrium. vaccinations, the market will end up at price Pp and quantity Qp as before, instead of the more efficient price Ps and quantity Qs. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an unfettered market is inefficient since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The issue of external benefits is related to that \n\nAdvertising: the overall demand for detergent is assumed steady.

However, there can be physical assets whose cost during production is fixed but which have a salvage value which can be obtained if there is a shutdown. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC. The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average cost, produce; if the price is between minimum average cost and minimum ANSC, produce; and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down. If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume). Now let the marginal propensity to consume for the construction company be 'c'. Thus, the construction company would spend an amount c×$1 i.e. The rules are equivalent&mdash;if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC (price exceeds average variable cost). Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down, and select the option that produces the greater profit (positive \n\n The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. To find the shutdown point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.
