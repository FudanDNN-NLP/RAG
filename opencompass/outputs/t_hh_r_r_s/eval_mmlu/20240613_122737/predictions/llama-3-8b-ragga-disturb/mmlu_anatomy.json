It is characterized by the abnormal growth of bones in the hands, feet, and head. The name \"acromegaly\" is derived from the Greek words \"acro,\" meaning extremities, and \"megaly,\" meaning enlargement. The abnormal growth of bones in acromegaly primarily affects the hands, feet, and head. This can cause enlargement of the fingers and toes, facial features (such as the nose, jaw, and forehead), and thickening of the skin and soft tissues. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thickened skin, enlarged organs, sleep apnea, and changes in facial appearance. Regular monitoring and management of associated health conditions are important for individuals with acromegaly. One of the common symptoms of acromegaly is the abnormal growth of bones in the hands, feet, and head. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience changes in facial features, such as the protrusion of the brow and lower jaw, enlargement of the nose, and widening of the gap between teeth. It's important to note that while some effects of acromegaly can be reversed with treatment, others may be permanent. The choice of treatment depends on the individual's case and should be discussed with a healthcare professional experienced in the management of acromegaly. And because cells with this mutant form of the Gs protein continue to secrete GH, this could result in the overgrowth of teeth in a patient. Another key syndrome which results in the expression of macrodontia is KBG syndrome. This is a rare congenital genetic syndrome that is characterized by facial dysmorphism, macrodontia of the permanent upper central incisors, and other skeletal abnormalities. Acromegaly is characterized by the gradual enlargement of the hands, feet, jaw, and other facial features. Individuals with acromegaly may experience symptoms such as enlarged hands and feet, facial changes including a protruding jaw and enlarged nose, thickened skin, joint pain, deepened voice, and various other systemic manifestations. The condition can also lead to comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, and colonic polyps. Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder that is primarily associated with excessive growth of hands, feet, and facial features due to the overproduction of growth hormone. While muscle hypertrophy is a well-known characteristic of acromegaly, it is important to note that this condition is also associated with several other symptoms and complications. One significant aspect of acromegaly is the overgrowth of bones, which can lead to joint pain, limited joint mobility, and an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis. Acromegaly is also associated with various metabolic disturbances. In addition to these systemic effects, acromegaly can also impact the respiratory system. The enlargement of the facial bones and soft tissues can lead to obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep due to narrow or blocked airways. In summary, while muscle hypertrophy is a prominent feature of acromegaly, this condition is associated with a wide range of other effects on the body.

Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries consist of a tube lined by endothelial cells with a central lumen. The walls have a unique structure: there are pores between the cells that allow water and soluble substances to exit and after passing through the glomerular basement membrane and between podocyte foot processes, enter the capsule as ultrafiltrate. Lining\n\nCapillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane consisting mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin, and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes: thus, the glomerular basement membrane is sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. It is outside the capillary lumen but surrounded by capillaries. It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein. Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. From there, it flows into the renal tubule—the nephron—which follows a U-shaped path to the collecting ducts, finally exiting into a renal calyx as urine. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole.

About 175 years later, surgeon and anatomist William Bowman elucidated in detail the capillary architecture of the glomerulus and the continuity between its surrounding capsule and the proximal tubule. The basic functional and structural unit of the kidney is nephron, which is mainly composed of four components: the glomerulus, tubules, the collecting duct and peritubular capillaries.

In the case of a spinal cord injury (SCI), the delicate bundle of nerves inside the vertebrae have been damaged. Some of the diseases that can cause injury to the spinal cord include multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, polio, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The majority of people who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of 16 and 30 because of riskier behaviors. What is a “complete” or “incomplete” spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury is called “complete” when testing by the medical team indicates that the patient is unable to make any voluntary movement below the level of the injury. The injury is called “incomplete” when testing demonstrates that the patient is able to make some voluntary movement below the level of injury. What is meant by the “level” of a spinal cord injury? A “quadriplegic” patient has a complete or incomplete injury at the cervical level. “Paraplegic” patients have an injury at or below this level. Below the lumbar region are the 5 sacral vertebrae (which are fused together) and 4 more fused vertebrae that make up the coccyx (tailbone). The most important thing to know is that each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different. Signs and symptoms Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury. An individual with an injury at C1 (the highest cervical vertebra, at the base of the skull) will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator-dependent. A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down. A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs, arms or any of the major function; this is often not the case. Some individuals with tetraplegia can walk and use their hands, as though they did not have a spinal cord injury, while others may use wheelchairs and they can still have function of their arms and mild finger movement; again, that varies on the spinal cord damage. It is common to have movement in limbs, such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands, or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury. Furthermore, the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body; either left or right side may be more affected, depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord. Causes Tetraplegia is caused by damage to the brain or the spinal cord at a high level. Typical causes of this damage are trauma (such as a traffic collision, diving into shallow water, a fall, a sports injury), disease (such as transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or polio), or congenital disorders (such as muscular dystrophy). Tetraplegia is defined in many ways; C1–C4 usually affects arm movement more so than a C5–C7 injury; however, all tetraplegics have or have had some kind of finger dysfunction. So, it is not uncommon to have a tetraplegic with fully functional arms but no nervous control of their fingers and thumbs. It is possible to suffer a broken neck without becoming tetraplegic if the vertebrae are fractured or dislocated but the spinal cord is not damaged. Conversely, it is possible to injure the spinal cord without breaking the spine, for example when a ruptured disc or bone spur on the vertebra protrudes into the spinal column. Diagnosis Classification Spinal cord injuries are classified as complete and incomplete by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification. Complete spinal-cord lesions Pathophysiologically, the spinal cord of the tetraplegic patient can be divided into three segments which can be useful for classifying the injury. Brown-Séquard syndrome: hemisection of the spinal cord. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia it is difficult to assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). On the other hand, it is well known that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful hyperesthesias and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. People with tetraplegia should be examined and informed concerning the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands. Prognosis Delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury has grave consequences for the victim. About 30% of cases of delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living, such as getting dressed, eating and bowel and bladder care. Low-level tetraplegics (C5 to C7) can often live independently. In the case of cerebral palsy, which is caused by damage to the motor cortex either before, during (10%), or after birth, some people with tetraplegia are gradually able to learn to stand or walk through physical therapy. Epidemiology There are an estimated 17,700 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States; the total number of people affected by spinal cord\n\nTetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia, is paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso; paraplegia is similar but does not affect the arms. Signs and symptoms Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury.

The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. People with tetraplegia should be examined and informed concerning the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands. Prognosis Delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury has grave consequences for the victim. About 30% of cases of delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living, such as getting dressed, eating and bowel and bladder care. Low-level tetraplegics (C5 to C7) can often live independently. In the case of cerebral palsy, which is caused by damage to the motor cortex either before, during (10%), or after birth, some people with tetraplegia are gradually able to learn to stand or walk through physical therapy. Epidemiology There are an estimated 17,700 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States; the total number of people affected by spinal cord\n\nTetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia, is paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso; paraplegia is similar but does not affect the arms. Signs and symptoms Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury. An individual with an injury at C1 (the highest cervical vertebra, at the base of the skull) will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator-dependent. A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down. A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs, arms or any of the major function; this is often not the case. Some individuals with tetraplegia can walk and use their hands, as though they did not have a spinal cord injury, while others may use wheelchairs and they can still have function of their arms and mild finger movement; again, that varies on the spinal cord damage. It is common to have movement in limbs, such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands, or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury. Furthermore, the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body; either left or right side may be more affected, depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord. Causes Tetraplegia is caused by damage to the brain or the spinal cord at a high level. Typical causes of this damage are trauma (such as a traffic collision, diving into shallow water, a fall, a sports injury), disease (such as transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or polio), or congenital disorders (such as muscular dystrophy). Tetraplegia is defined in many ways; C1–C4 usually affects arm movement more so than a C5–C7 injury; however, all tetraplegics have or have had some kind of finger dysfunction. So, it is not uncommon to have a tetraplegic with fully functional arms but no nervous control of their fingers and thumbs. It is possible to suffer a broken neck without becoming tetraplegic if the vertebrae are fractured or dislocated but the spinal cord is not damaged. Conversely, it is possible to injure the spinal cord without breaking the spine, for example when a ruptured disc or bone spur on the vertebra protrudes into the spinal column. Diagnosis Classification Spinal cord injuries are classified as complete and incomplete by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification. Complete spinal-cord lesions Pathophysiologically, the spinal cord of the tetraplegic patient can be divided into three segments which can be useful for classifying the injury. Brown-Séquard syndrome: hemisection of the spinal cord. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia it is difficult to assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). On the other hand, it is well known that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful hyperesthesias and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned.

        "context": "Note: Spinal cord injury is very different from injuries such as fractured vertebrae, pinched nerves, spinal stenosis or ruptured disks. In the case of a spinal cord injury (SCI), the delicate bundle of nerves inside the vertebrae have been damaged. Some of the diseases that can cause injury to the spinal cord include multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, polio, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The majority of people who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of 16 and 30 because of riskier behaviors. What is a “complete” or “incomplete” spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury is called “complete” when testing by the medical team indicates that the patient is unable to make any voluntary movement below the level of the injury. The injury is called “incomplete” when testing demonstrates that the patient is able to make some voluntary movement below the level of injury. What is meant by the “level” of a spinal cord injury? A “quadriplegic” patient has a complete or incomplete injury at the cervical level. “Paraplegic” patients have an injury at or below this level. Below the lumbar region are the 5 sacral vertebrae (which are fused together) and 4 more fused vertebrae that make up the coccyx (tailbone). The most important thing to know is that each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different. Signs and symptoms Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso.

The lower edge of the liver can be palpated below the right costal margin when the patient takes a deep breath. Additionally, the gallbladder is also located in this quadrant. Moving to the right lower quadrant, you can find the cecum and appendix. McBurney's point, which is one-third of the way up along a line from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, is a common surface projection of the appendix. Another method involves dividing the abdomen into nine regions using sagittal and transverse planes. The three central regions are the epigastric, umbilical, and pubic regions, while the three regions on each side are the hypochondrium, flank, and groin regions. The pain from the abdominal part of the foregut is referred to the epigastric region, pain from the midgut is referred to the umbilical region, and pain from the hindgut is referred to the pubic region. In humans it consists of the clavicle and scapula; in those species with three bones in the shoulder, it consists of the clavicle, scapula, and coracoid. No anatomical joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection or physiological joint between the two permits great mobility of the shoulder girdle compared to the compact pelvic girdle; because the upper limb is not usually involved in weight bearing, its stability has been sacrificed in exchange for greater mobility. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular. Externally, the most prominent features of the heart are the right appendage (or right auricle), the sulcus terminalis, and the coronary sulcus. The sulcus terminalis, or terminal groove, is a shallow groove that travels from the IVC to the SVC and separates the right appendage from the venous compartment of the right ventricle. At the upper end of sulcus terminalis lies the sinoatrial node. The sinoatrial node receives blood supply from a branch of the right coronary artery or circumflex artery in 55% and 45% of people respectively. Throughout this movement the scapula is rotated around the chest wall so that it moves 15 cm laterally and the glenoid cavity is rotated 40–45° in the horizontal plane. At this position, the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated posteriorly so that the angle at the acromioclavicular joint opens up slightly. At this \n\nThe abdomen can be divided into four quadrants and nine regions. The four abdominal quadrants are determined by a horizontal line and a vertical line that intersect at the umbilicus. On the other hand, the nine abdominal regions are defined as follows:\n\n1. Right hypochondriac region: Situated on the right side of the epigastric region, above the umbilicus, and contains the liver and gallbladder. Umbilical region: Located around the umbilicus or navel and contains the small intestine and transverse colon. Right lumbar region: Situated on the right side of the umbilical region and contains the ascending colon. Left lumbar region: Found on the left side of the umbilical region and contains the descending colon. Hypogastric region: Located in the lower middle part of the abdomen, below the umbilicus, and includes the urinary bladder and reproductive organs. Right iliac region: Situated on the right side of the hypogastric region and contains the cecum and appendix. These divisions are used to help pinpoint specific anatomical features and identify areas of abnormalities or disease processes within the abdomen.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

Moving to the right lower quadrant, you can find the cecum and appendix. McBurney's point, which is one-third of the way up along a line from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, is a common surface projection of the appendix. Another method involves dividing the abdomen into nine regions using sagittal and transverse planes. The three central regions are the epigastric, umbilical, and pubic regions, while the three regions on each side are the hypochondrium, flank, and groin regions. The pain from the abdominal part of the foregut is referred to the epigastric region, pain from the midgut is referred to the umbilical region, and pain from the hindgut is referred to the pubic region. In humans it consists of the clavicle and scapula; in those species with three bones in the shoulder, it consists of the clavicle, scapula, and coracoid. No anatomical joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection or physiological joint between the two permits great mobility of the shoulder girdle compared to the compact pelvic girdle; because the upper limb is not usually involved in weight bearing, its stability has been sacrificed in exchange for greater mobility. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular. Externally, the most prominent features of the heart are the right appendage (or right auricle), the sulcus terminalis, and the coronary sulcus. The sulcus terminalis, or terminal groove, is a shallow groove that travels from the IVC to the SVC and separates the right appendage from the venous compartment of the right ventricle. At the upper end of sulcus terminalis lies the sinoatrial node. The sinoatrial node receives blood supply from a branch of the right coronary artery or circumflex artery in 55% and 45% of people respectively. Throughout this movement the scapula is rotated around the chest wall so that it moves 15 cm laterally and the glenoid cavity is rotated 40–45° in the horizontal plane. At this position, the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated posteriorly so that the angle at the acromioclavicular joint opens up slightly. At this \n\nThe abdomen can be divided into four quadrants and nine regions. The four abdominal quadrants are determined by a horizontal line and a vertical line that intersect at the umbilicus. On the other hand, the nine abdominal regions are defined as follows:\n\n1. Right hypochondriac region: Situated on the right side of the epigastric region, above the umbilicus, and contains the liver and gallbladder. Umbilical region: Located around the umbilicus or navel and contains the small intestine and transverse colon. Right lumbar region: Situated on the right side of the umbilical region and contains the ascending colon. Left lumbar region: Found on the left side of the umbilical region and contains the descending colon. Hypogastric region: Located in the lower middle part of the abdomen, below the umbilicus, and includes the urinary bladder and reproductive organs. Right iliac region: Situated on the right side of the hypogastric region and contains the cecum and appendix. These divisions are used to help pinpoint specific anatomical features and identify areas of abnormalities or disease processes within the abdomen.\n\n"

Additionally, midline epithelial dysfunction (MED) refers to impairment in the surface mucosa of the embryonic shelves, leading to a failure of palatal fusion. In summary, the development of the secondary palate in human embryos begins around the sixth week of pregnancy.

The secondary palate is not only vital for human embryology but also has evolutionary importance in warm-blooded animals. In the fetus, the formation of the calvaria involves a process known as intramembranous ossification.

It is also prone to a variety of medical and dental disorders. It is sometimes considered to be a specialty of dentistry and pathology. ear, nose and throat) in addition to maxillofacial disorders. Diagnosis The key to any diagnosis is thorough medical, dental, social and psychological history as well as assessing certain lifestyle risk factors that may be involved in disease processes. This is followed by a thorough clinical investigation including extra-oral and intra-oral hard and soft tissues. It is sometimes the case that a diagnosis and treatment regime are possible to determine from history and examination, however it is good practice to compile a list of differential diagnoses. There are many types of investigations in diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases, including screening tests, imaging (radiographs, CBCT, CT, MRI, ultrasound) and histopathology (biopsy). Biopsy A biopsy is indicated when the patient's clinical presentation, past history or imaging studies do not allow a definitive diagnosis. Examples of the most common tissues examined by means of a biopsy include oral and sinus mucosa, bone, soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases Oral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction. Some examples include food going up into the nasal cavity during swallowing as the soft palate is not present to close the cavity during the process. Macroglossia Is a rare condition, categorised by tongue enlargement which will eventually create a crenated border in relation to the embrasures between the teeth.

This leads to an increase in the thickness and the length of the stylohyoid process and the ligament. Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5–3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. Acquired Vascular Infective Bacterial (Plaque-induced) gingivitis—A common periodontal (gum) disease is Gingivitis. Periodontal refers to the area the infection affects, which include the teeth, gums, and tissues surrounding the teeth. The condition involves the release of pyrogenic and erythrogenic endotoxins from the immune system. It starts as tonsilitis and pharyngitis before involving the soft palate and the tongue. If not treated, late stages of this condition may include a furred, raw, red tongue. Viral Herpes simplex (infection with herpes simplex virus, or HSV) is very common in the mouth and lips.

It is also prone to a variety of medical and dental disorders. It is sometimes considered to be a specialty of dentistry and pathology. ear, nose and throat) in addition to maxillofacial disorders. Diagnosis The key to any diagnosis is thorough medical, dental, social and psychological history as well as assessing certain lifestyle risk factors that may be involved in disease processes. This is followed by a thorough clinical investigation including extra-oral and intra-oral hard and soft tissues. It is sometimes the case that a diagnosis and treatment regime are possible to determine from history and examination, however it is good practice to compile a list of differential diagnoses. There are many types of investigations in diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases, including screening tests, imaging (radiographs, CBCT, CT, MRI, ultrasound) and histopathology (biopsy). Biopsy A biopsy is indicated when the patient's clinical presentation, past history or imaging studies do not allow a definitive diagnosis. Examples of the most common tissues examined by means of a biopsy include oral and sinus mucosa, bone, soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases Oral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction. Some examples include food going up into the nasal cavity during swallowing as the soft palate is not present to close the cavity during the process. Macroglossia Is a rare condition, categorised by tongue enlargement which will eventually create a crenated border in relation to the embrasures between the teeth.

This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases Oral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction. Some examples include food going up into the nasal cavity during swallowing as the soft palate is not present to close the cavity during the process. Macroglossia Is a rare condition, categorised by tongue enlargement which will eventually create a crenated border in relation to the embrasures between the teeth. Hereditary Cause Vascular malformations Down syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Duchenne muscular dystrophy Neurofibromatosis type Is Acquired Causes Carcinoma Lingual Thyroid Myxedema Amyloidosis Consequences Noisy breaths, obstructs airway if severe Drooling Difficult in eating Lisping speech Open-bite Protruding tongue, may ulcerate and undergo necrosis Treatments For mild cases, surgical treatment is not mandatory but if speech is affected, speech therapy may be useful. Reduction glossectomy may be required for severe cases. Ankyloglossia Stafne defect Torus palatinus Torus mandibularis Eagle syndrome, Is a condition where there is an abnormal ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. This leads to an increase in the thickness and the length of the stylohyoid process and the ligament. Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5–3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. Acquired Vascular Infective Bacterial (Plaque-induced) gingivitis—A common periodontal (gum) disease is Gingivitis. Periodontal refers to the area the infection affects, which include the teeth, gums, and tissues surrounding the teeth. The condition involves the release of pyrogenic and erythrogenic endotoxins from the immune system. It starts as tonsilitis and pharyngitis before involving the soft palate and the tongue. If not treated, late stages of this condition may include a furred, raw, red tongue. Viral Herpes simplex (infection with herpes simplex virus, or HSV) is very common in the mouth and lips.\n\n"

Injury to any one of these structures by infection, trauma or neoplasm can cause temporary or permanent visual dysfunction, and even blindness if not promptly corrected. Damage to the oculomotor nerve can result in an inability to move the eye normally, leading to strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) and double vision (diplopia). The oculomotor nerve also innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which lifts the upper eyelid, and the sphincter pupillae muscle, which constricts the pupil. Therefore, oculomotor nerve palsy can also cause drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis) due to the disruption of these muscles' function. Reference: Oculomotor nerve palsy or oculomotor neuropathy is an eye condition resulting from damage to the third cranial nerve or a branch thereof. The limitations of eye movement resulting from the condition are generally so severe that patients are often unable to maintain normal eye alignment when gazing straight ahead, leading to strabismus and, as a consequence, double vision (diplopia).

It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. This joint is unique in that it is a bilateral joint that functions as one unit. Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints must function together and therefore are not independent of each other. Structure The main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle. Articular disc The unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone. Ligaments There are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function. The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. Other ligaments, called \"oto-mandibular ligaments\", connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint: discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament, malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament. Nerve supply Sensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Pacinian corpuscles are dynamic mechanoreceptors that accelerate movement during reflexes. Golgi tendon organs function as static mechanoreceptors for the protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint. The fibrocartilage that overlays the TMJ condyle is not innervated and is avascular in healthy TMJs. When bone tissue, ligaments, or muscles become inflamed or injured, sensory signals are relayed along small-diameter primary afferent nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Signals are directed through the trigeminal nerve and modulated by neuronal cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint. Development Formation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation.

Development Formation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. ; Posteriorly, the disc attaches superiorly to the temporal bone and inferiorly to the posterior condyle (the posterior attachments are frequently called the bilaminar zone). ; Laterally and medially, the disc attachments blend into the joint capsule near its attachment to the condylar head. The articular disk of the temporomandibular joint is a thin, oval plate made of non-vascular fibrous connective tissue, which is located between the mandible's condyloid process and the cranium's mandibular fossa. Its upper surface is concavo-convex from before \n\n The lateral pterygoid muscle may be involved in temporomandibular joint dysfunction. In anatomy, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are the two joints connecting the jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. This joint is unique in that it is a bilateral joint that functions as one unit. Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints must function together and therefore are not independent of each other. Structure The main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle. Articular disc The unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone. Ligaments There are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function. The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. Other ligaments, called \"oto-mandibular ligaments\", connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint: discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament, malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament. Nerve supply Sensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. These are only sensory innervation. The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Pacinian corpuscles are dynamic mechanoreceptors that accelerate movement during reflexes. Golgi tendon organs function as static mechanoreceptors for the protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint. The fibrocartilage that overlays the TMJ condyle is not innervated and is avascular in healthy TMJs. When bone tissue, ligaments, or muscles become inflamed or injured, sensory signals are relayed along small-diameter primary afferent nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Signals are directed through the trigeminal nerve and modulated by neuronal cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint.
