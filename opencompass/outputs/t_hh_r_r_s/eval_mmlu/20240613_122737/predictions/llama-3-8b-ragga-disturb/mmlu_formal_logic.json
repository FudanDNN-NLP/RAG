Sigmund Freud, now considered the founder of psychoanalysis, first proposed in 1905 that there are both conscious and unconscious aspects to the mind. He developed this theory over the next 20 years, and postulated that unconscious forces deriving from deeply ingrained value systems originating from parents or society (the superego), or instinctive drives (the id), could, together with pressures in one's external life, challenge and cause conflict with the conscious self (the ego). Freud proposed that the healthy child has to progress appropriately through oral, anal, phallic, latent and genital phases in order to mature as a healthy adult, and problems encountered in any of the stages could result in lasting psychological disorder. For example, he proposed that the anal stage was when the toddler ideally achieves a sense of separateness and becomes independent in terms of toilet training. Freud's theories and their rigid distinctions are less accepted nowadays, but his beliefs that the psyche undergoes progressive development throughout childhood, and that unconscious material originating from episodes scattered along the course of that development can persist to lead to mental illness, still very much influence modern psychotherapeutic practice.

These emergencies include severe infections, heart attacks, strokes, toxic ingestions, fractures and major trauma. Our department also has an established Extended Diagnostic and Treatment Unit (EDTU) with various clinical protocols to facilitate and expedite care for our patients. Being affiliated with the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and the MOHH National Residency Program, we are committed to the education of medical students and residents. We continually evaluate our teaching curriculum and have incorporated simulation training and small group discussions to enhance student education. Our Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) at NUH is staffed 24/7 by registered specialists, who work in conjunction with other in-house specialists to provide efficient and quality treatment for all medical and surgical emergencies. The intensified therapy and extended period for diagnostic testing allows illnesses to be accurately assessed and managed at our observational unit. To help you with the management of your symptoms and illness, we have provided some general advice and danger features here on common symptoms and conditions. As an Academic Medical Centre EMD, we are committed to deliver high quality clinical care. The EMD provides emergency care in the NUH tertiary Academic Medical Centre. In addition, it also partners Academy of Medicine, Singapore, in providing training for Diploma in Emergency Medicine for doctors working in Singapore who wish to pursue a non-EM specialist track. The EM Clinical Observer and EM Clinical Fellow programs add to the diversity of training opportunities for doctors interested in the specialty of Emergency Medicine. The department serves as a clinical training site for Phase IV students from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS YLLSoM). The students also experience a short attachment with the paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. For students from Universities with Bilateral Exchange Agreement (BEA) with NUS YLLSoM, you can apply from here. NUH Nursing Department conducts in-house structured American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Specialized Course, namely Advanced Emergency Nursing Course (AENC) and Advanced Medical Nursing Course (AMNC), for our nurses to equip them with higher knowledge and skills to provide quality care for our patients. In addition, NUH EMD provides opportunities to our nurses; enhancing their role/ skills as an emergency nurse to attend courses such as Life Support Course for Nurses, HazMat Course, Burns Course and more. In June 2014, NUH EMD started a work group to create guidelines to care for patients identified for EOL/ Palliative Care. Some barriers to the institution of EOL care in the EMD include the time constraints, historical and cultural attitudes of EMD health care workers, lack of appropriate space and societal expectations of emergency care. The EOL work group organised formal teaching sessions and opportunistic learning at the bedside. The EOL initiative also facilitates the continuity of care from the EMD setting to the ward and in some cases, even to the home setting with terminal discharges. Geriatric Emergency Nursing (GEM) service was started in May 2014 by Nurse Clinicians in the EMD. GEM nurse performs comprehensive geriatric assessment, identify specific care needs and provide appropriate referrals before patient is being discharged from the EMD. This ensures the safe transition of care form tertiary hospital to the community and also decreases the revisit of the elderly patients. GEM nurses are resource persons for staff to provide holistic care for elderly patients at EMD. It is important for parents to communicate with the school nurse and provide the necessary forms signed by their physician to ensure proper care. Furthermore, our school encourages open communication between parents, students, and school staff to create a safe environment. Parents are encouraged to contact the school nurse to discuss their child's specific food allergies and any additional measures that may be needed. Additionally, our school recognizes the significance of food allergies and strives to foster awareness and education within the school community. Ultimately, our school aims to ensure that students with specific food allergies can safely participate in all aspects of their education and school life. This postponed each of the final three science lab projects by one year. The school has three portable electronics carts: one for laptops, one for iPads, and one for Linux netbooks. This enables entire classes \n\n The school's motto is Verbum Sap Sat, short for the Latin Verbum sapienti sat est, meaning \"A Word to the Wise is Sufficient.\" H-B Woodlawn is run on the belief that left with responsibilities, students will learn and get work done. Another tradition is the Teacher/Senior Play, at the beginning of the year, and the Teacher Play, at the end of the year. Since 1971, it has been tradition for the students to interrupt the Head Teacher (now Principal), of not allowing him/her to speak by clapping for roughly five minutes any time the Head Teacher speaks at the school. Before Thanksgiving break, H-B's physical education teachers organize the Turkey Bowl, where the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior classes face off in flag football.

The Department of SURRADIC provides the highest expertise in all areas of teaching, research and clinical practice to Jamaica and the Region. Our emphasis is on the teaching and training of undergraduate and postgraduate medical professionals, in a patient-centred professional practice supported by a research thrust that is geared towards a greater understanding of indigenous health issues and their management. As a department we encourage the development of ideas with wider members of the UWI community and promote academic excellence, provide public service, support innovation in teaching and learning and foster mutually beneficial partnerships. The Department of SURRADIC is a student-centred, research oriented multidisciplinary unit. UHWI and the other affiliated teaching sites will position itself as the center of excellence for local and international patients, providing high quality evidence-based decisions in a compassionate environment that will allow each team member to maximize their potential to the fullest. SURRADIC will engage the public and the wider UWI community in providing the world-class environment whilst allowing the community to benefit from our presence. With over 120 faculty, including four full professors, distributed at the UHWI and 8 additional teaching sites, it is understandably why the Department is one of the largest in the FMS. The Department provides a student-centred environment that is conducive to quality evidence-based teaching and learning with an emphasis on the use of new technologies to improve academic and administrative processes. At the undergraduate level we provide curriculum based learning objectives in all the various fields of surgery, radiology, anaesthesia, intensive care and emergency medicine so that our doctors graduating with the MBBS degree will be safe and competent in diagnosing and treating patients with ailments in these areas. All this is done whilst fostering a closer relationship with our students to ensure that the Department members remain role models and with a strong interest in the welfare of our students. The Department of SURRADIC offers full-time degree courses leading to the awarding of a Doctor of Medicine [DM] degree.

The EM Clinical Observer and EM Clinical Fellow programs add to the diversity of training opportunities for doctors interested in the specialty of Emergency Medicine. The department serves as a clinical training site for Phase IV students from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS YLLSoM). The students also experience a short attachment with the paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. For students from Universities with Bilateral Exchange Agreement (BEA) with NUS YLLSoM, you can apply from here. NUH Nursing Department conducts in-house structured American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Specialized Course, namely Advanced Emergency Nursing Course (AENC) and Advanced Medical Nursing Course (AMNC), for our nurses to equip them with higher knowledge and skills to provide quality care for our patients. In addition, NUH EMD provides opportunities to our nurses; enhancing their role/ skills as an emergency nurse to attend courses such as Life Support Course for Nurses, HazMat Course, Burns Course and more. In June 2014, NUH EMD started a work group to create guidelines to care for patients identified for EOL/ Palliative Care. Some barriers to the institution of EOL care in the EMD include the time constraints, historical and cultural attitudes of EMD health care workers, lack of appropriate space and societal expectations of emergency care. The EOL work group organised formal teaching sessions and opportunistic learning at the bedside. The EOL initiative also facilitates the continuity of care from the EMD setting to the ward and in some cases, even to the home setting with terminal discharges. Geriatric Emergency Nursing (GEM) service was started in May 2014 by Nurse Clinicians in the EMD. GEM nurse performs comprehensive geriatric assessment, identify specific care needs and provide appropriate referrals before patient is being discharged from the EMD. This ensures the safe transition of care form tertiary hospital to the community and also decreases the revisit of the elderly patients. GEM nurses are resource persons for staff to provide holistic care for elderly patients at EMD. It is important for parents to communicate with the school nurse and provide the necessary forms signed by their physician to ensure proper care. Furthermore, our school encourages open communication between parents, students, and school staff to create a safe environment. Parents are encouraged to contact the school nurse to discuss their child's specific food allergies and any additional measures that may be needed. Additionally, our school recognizes the significance of food allergies and strives to foster awareness and education within the school community. Ultimately, our school aims to ensure that students with specific food allergies can safely participate in all aspects of their education and school life. This postponed each of the final three science lab projects by one year. The school has three portable electronics carts: one for laptops, one for iPads, and one for Linux netbooks. This enables entire classes \n\n The school's motto is Verbum Sap Sat, short for the Latin Verbum sapienti sat est, meaning \"A Word to the Wise is Sufficient.\" H-B Woodlawn is run on the belief that left with responsibilities, students will learn and get work done. Another tradition is the Teacher/Senior Play, at the beginning of the year, and the Teacher Play, at the end of the year. Since 1971, it has been tradition for the students to interrupt the Head Teacher (now Principal), of not allowing him/her to speak by clapping for roughly five minutes any time the Head Teacher speaks at the school. Before Thanksgiving break, H-B's physical education teachers organize the Turkey Bowl, where the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior classes face off in flag football. On Halloween, or the nearest \n\nThe Department of Surgery, Radiology, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (SURRADIC) is the largest clinical department in the FMS. The Department of SURRADIC provides the highest expertise in all areas of teaching, research and clinical practice to Jamaica and the Region. Our emphasis is on the teaching and training of undergraduate and postgraduate medical professionals, in a patient-centred professional practice supported by a research thrust that is geared towards a greater understanding of indigenous health issues and their management. As a department we encourage the development of ideas with wider members of the UWI community and promote academic excellence, provide public service, support innovation in teaching and learning and foster mutually beneficial partnerships. The Department of SURRADIC is a student-centred, research oriented multidisciplinary unit. UHWI and the other affiliated teaching sites will position itself as the center of excellence for local and international patients, providing high quality evidence-based decisions in a compassionate environment that will allow each team member to maximize their potential to the fullest. SURRADIC will engage the public and the wider UWI community in providing the world-class environment whilst allowing the community to benefit from our presence. With over 120 faculty, including four full professors, distributed at the UHWI and 8 additional teaching sites, it is understandably why the Department is one of the largest in the FMS. The Department provides a student-centred environment that is conducive to quality evidence-based teaching and learning with an emphasis on the use of new technologies to improve academic and administrative processes. At the undergraduate level we provide curriculum based learning objectives in all the various fields of surgery, radiology, anaesthesia, intensive care and emergency medicine so that our doctors graduating with the MBBS degree will be safe and competent in diagnosing and treating patients with ailments in these areas. All this is done whilst fostering a closer relationship with our students to ensure that the Department members remain role models and with a strong interest in the welfare of our students. The Department of SURRADIC offers full-time degree courses leading to the awarding of a Doctor of Medicine [DM] degree. All programmes aim at providing exit qualifications for graduates to practice independently and at Consultant level.\n\n"

You can find the full text at this link. In May last year we (Simon and I, together with some great colleagues) published a paper in Heart reporting how we derived and externally validated the MACS (Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes) rule for suspected cardiac chest pain. The MACS rule can be used to help you decide where to send a patient who presents to the ED with what could be cardiac chest pain. The MACS rule includes eight variables. The computer will calculate the estimated probability of a major adverse cardiac event within 30 days and will use that to tell you where it thinks you should send the patient. In case reading whole journal articles isn’t your bag, or if you also like to know the story and interpretation behind the work, we also blogged about our initial paper, of course. If you follow those links, you’ll see that Ryan’s critical appraisal of the MACS rule wasn’t entirely positive. So, yes, Ryan was right that (using an ELISA) the MACS rule is unusable. However, it’s a different test to the one we ran originally. If you’ve listened to our troponin podcasts, you’ll know that not all assays are the same – so if this test really is to make the MACS rule ‘useable’ then we need to check that the rule would still perform well if we were to use it in practice. Then, we calculated the diagnostic performance. So, my feeling (as the lead author) is that we actually defined the primary outcome badly. We said that patients with a new coronary stenosis had developed a major adverse cardiac event. However, it would be difficult to suggest that either of these patients ought to have been admitted to hospital in reality. We specifically designed the MACS rule to risk stratify all patients and to identify ‘high risk’ as well as ‘very low risk’ patients. In doing so, we hope that it’ll be able to make the most judicious use of resources. It’s all very well having a decision rule that sends a few patients home early – but if it increases admissions to Coronary Care Units (which are very expensive) then it’ll actually increase healthcare costs overall. That ensures that the MACS rule is definitely ‘useable’ in practice. The next step is to find out what actually happens when we use it in practice. We’ve already started down that road – and we’ve just finished a new study looking at the feasibility of running an RCT of the MACS rule when compared with standard practice. We’re also about to start a new study that will compare the MACS rule against some of the best analysis – like the HEART score and the ED-ACS score.

Premise#n Conclusion This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:  This is the modus ponens rule of propositional logic. Rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables. In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions) to form an infinite set of inference rules. A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called derivations. Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a hypothetical statement: \"if the premises hold, then the conclusion holds.\" \"A is false\" (see classical logic), \"A is true at time t\" (see temporal logic), \"A is necessarily true\" or \"A is possibly true\" (see modal logic), \"the program M has type τ\" (see programming languages and type theory), \"A is achievable from the available resources\" (see linear logic), and many others. To start with, we shall concern ourselves with the simplest two judgments \"A is a proposition\" and \"A is true\", abbreviated as \"A prop\" and \"A true\" respectively. The judgment \"A prop\" defines the structure of valid proofs of A, which in turn defines the structure of propositions. For this reason, the inference rules for this judgment are sometimes known as formation rules. To illustrate, if we have two propositions A and B (that is, the judgments \"A prop\" and \"B prop\" are evident), then we form the compound proposition A and B, written symbolically as \"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about formal logic.

        "context": "This blog post is based on a paper we’ve just had published in the Emergency Medicine Journal entitled: ‘The Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes (MACS) decision rule: validation with a new automated assay for heart-type fatty acid binding protein’. You can find the full text at this link. In May last year we (Simon and I, together with some great colleagues) published a paper in Heart reporting how we derived and externally validated the MACS (Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes) rule for suspected cardiac chest pain. The MACS rule can be used to help you decide where to send a patient who presents to the ED with what could be cardiac chest pain. The MACS rule includes eight variables. The computer will calculate the estimated probability of a major adverse cardiac event within 30 days and will use that to tell you where it thinks you should send the patient. In case reading whole journal articles isn’t your bag, or if you also like to know the story and interpretation behind the work, we also blogged about our initial paper, of course. If you follow those links, you’ll see that Ryan’s critical appraisal of the MACS rule wasn’t entirely positive. So, yes, Ryan was right that (using an ELISA) the MACS rule is unusable. However, it’s a different test to the one we ran originally. If you’ve listened to our troponin podcasts, you’ll know that not all assays are the same – so if this test really is to make the MACS rule ‘useable’ then we need to check that the rule would still perform well if we were to use it in practice. Then, we calculated the diagnostic performance. So, my feeling (as the lead author) is that we actually defined the primary outcome badly. We said that patients with a new coronary stenosis had developed a major adverse cardiac event. However, it would be difficult to suggest that either of these patients ought to have been admitted to hospital in reality. We specifically designed the MACS rule to risk stratify all patients and to identify ‘high risk’ as well as ‘very low risk’ patients. In doing so, we hope that it’ll be able to make the most judicious use of resources. It’s all very well having a decision rule that sends a few patients home early – but if it increases admissions to Coronary Care Units (which are very expensive) then it’ll actually increase healthcare costs overall. That ensures that the MACS rule is definitely ‘useable’ in practice. The next step is to find out what actually happens when we use it in practice. We’ve already started down that road – and we’ve just finished a new study looking at the feasibility of running an RCT of the MACS rule when compared with standard practice. We’re also about to start a new study that will compare the MACS rule against some of the best analysis – like the HEART score and the ED-ACS score.

Premise#n Conclusion This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:  This is the modus ponens rule of propositional logic. Rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables. In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions) to form an infinite set of inference rules. A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called derivations. Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a hypothetical statement: \"if the premises hold, then the conclusion holds.\" \"A is false\" (see classical logic), \"A is true at time t\" (see temporal logic), \"A is necessarily true\" or \"A is possibly true\" (see modal logic), \"the program M has type τ\" (see programming languages and type theory), \"A is achievable from the available resources\" (see linear logic), and many others. To start with, we shall concern ourselves with the simplest two judgments \"A is a proposition\" and \"A is true\", abbreviated as \"A prop\" and \"A true\" respectively. The judgment \"A prop\" defines the structure of valid proofs of A, which in turn defines the structure of propositions. For this reason, the inference rules for this judgment are sometimes known as formation rules. To illustrate, if we have two propositions A and B (that is, the judgments \"A prop\" and \"B prop\" are evident), then we form the compound proposition A and B, written symbolically as \"\n\n"
