Quota sampling, on the other hand, involves selecting participants based on pre-determined quotas, such as selecting a certain number of respondents from each demographic group. However, it is important to consider the potential limitations of quota sampling as well. Probability sampling, when properly implemented, allows researchers to calculate sampling error and make statistical inferences about the target population. Quota sampling, on the other hand, does not provide the same level of statistical rigor. In conclusion, while quota sampling can offer advantages in terms of control over sample composition and cost-effectiveness, it is important to be aware of the potential limitations, such as selection bias and limited statistical inference. Sampling error refers to the variability that arises from using a sample of the population rather than counting every individual. Matching error occurs when individuals or households are incorrectly matched between the census data and the post-enumeration survey (PES). Inaccurate matching can be caused by various factors, such as differences in data collection methods or errors in data entry. These errors can be due to factors like nonresponse bias, coverage errors, or measurement errors. Nonresponse bias occurs when individuals or households selected for the survey do not respond, and this can introduce bias into the estimates. Coverage errors arise from the undercoverage or overcoverage of certain population groups. This is because there may be limited information available about the accuracy of certain components of error, such as the failure of assumptions in the capture-recapture model. In summary, when estimating the accuracy of dual systems estimates, census estimates of population, and estimates of undercount in the census, factors such as sampling error, matching error, and other nonsampling errors are considered. Risk-based auditing is a style of auditing which focuses upon the analysis and management of risk. This then encouraged the audit activity of studying these risks rather than just checking compliance with existing controls. Standards for risk management have included the COSO guidelines and the first international standard, AS/NZS 4360. A traditional audit would focus upon the transactions which would make up financial statements such as the balance sheet. An experiment suggested that managers might respond to risk-based auditing by transferring activity to accounts which are ostensibly low risk. Auditors would need to anticipate such attempts to game the process. It has been suggested in research the tone of an annual report reflects factors that auditors consider in assessing audit risk. It's important to note that sampling error is inherent in any type of statistical analysis that involves taking a sample from a larger population. It arises due to the discrepancies between the characteristics of the sample and the population it represents. The larger the sampling error, the less representative the sample is of the population, and the less accurate our conclusions or inferences will be. To minimize sampling errors, researchers often employ various sampling techniques, such as random sampling or stratified sampling, to ensure that the sample is as representative as possible. Minimizing sampling error is crucial in obtaining accurate and reliable results, and this can be achieved through careful sample selection and increasing the sample size. It is typically caused by the inherent variability in any sampling process. There are several factors that can contribute to sampling errors. One common cause is the random nature of sampling. Another factor that can contribute to sampling errors is the size of the sample. Different sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, or cluster sampling, have their own strengths and weaknesses. If a significant portion of the selected sample does not participate or provide complete information, it can introduce a bias and affect the representativeness of the sample. They may use appropriate sampling techniques, ensure an adequate sample size, and carefully consider the characteristics of the population they are studying. This discrepancy arises due to the random nature of sampling, the size of the sample, the sampling technique used, and potential nonresponse.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional accounting.

Oxygen Biotherapeutics reported net revenue of $514,872 for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $95,159 for the comparable quarter in the previous fiscal year. Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year. Research and development expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $604,574 compared to $488,577 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. For the second quarter ended October 31, 2012, the Company reported a net loss of $1,557,278, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,929,923, or $0.12 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Total net revenue for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $786,968 compared to total revenue of $120,032 for the same period in fiscal year 2012. Total operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $3,145,252 compared to $4,602,337 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses. Research and development expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,241,846 compared to $1,140,538 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $2,785,535 compared to $1,316,687 for the same period in 2011. The increase in interest and other expenses for the period was due primarily to the non-cash interest charges for dividends and fair value adjustments on our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock that was not incurred in the prior year, partially offset by the non-cash interest charges for the accretion of the discount on our notes payable which were not incurred in the current period. The Company reported a net loss of $5,143,819, or $0.17 per share for the six month period ended October 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $5,798,992, or $0.25 per share for the same period in 2011. As of October 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,511,513, compared to $1,879,872 at April 30, 2012. Our company's focus is reflected in our financial results and we remain committed to investing a substantial amount of our resources on development of the programs that will lead us to success and build stockholder value.\" The company has developed a proprietary perfluorocarbon (PFC) therapeutic oxygen carrier called Oxycyte® that is currently in\n\nOn May 3, 2018, there were 115,235,013 shares of common stock outstanding at a par value of $0.001 per share. Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 1998, and our headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. We have prepared the March 31, 2018 balance sheet and statements of comprehensive income and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Our financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of Corcept Therapeutics UK Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary, which we incorporated in the United Kingdom in March 2017. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions each quarter, including those related to revenue recognition, recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, inventory, allowances for doubtful accounts and other accrued liabilities, including our bonus accrual, clinical trial accruals and stock-based compensation. When choosing which assumptions to rely upon when determining the value of a financial instrument, we look first for quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (“Level 1 inputs”). If no Level 1 inputs are available, we consider (i) quoted prices in non-active markets for identical instruments; (ii) active markets for similar instruments; (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the instrument; and (iv) inputs that are not directly observable, but that are corroborated by observable data (“Level 2 inputs”). In the absence of Level 2 inputs, we rely on unobservable inputs, such as our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instrument (“Level 3 inputs”). We consider highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities, primarily U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate notes, asset backed securities and repurchase agreements. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and report them at fair value as “cash equivalents” or “marketable securities” on our balance sheet, with related unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity. We limit our investments to U.S. Treasury obligations and high-grade corporate debt, asset backed securities and repurchase agreements with less than a 36-month maturity at the time of purchase. Because product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained, we record the cost of manufacturing our product candidates as research and development expenses at the time such costs are incurred. We capitalize to inventory manufacturing costs related to Korlym. We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and determine the cost of inventory we sell using the specific identification method, which approximates a first-in, first-out basis. We write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing Korlym, including materials, third-party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs, based on the number of Korlym tablets for which we recognize revenue, as well as costs of stability testing, logistics and distribution. We classify inventory we do not expect to consume within 12 months of the balance sheet date as strategic inventory, a noncurrent asset. Accounting for the Financing Agreement required us to estimate the amount of each future quarterly payment and the accretion of interest expense. To determine our revenue from the sale of Korlym, we (i) identify our contract with each customer; (ii) identify the obligations of Corcept and the customer under the contract; (iii) determine the contracted transaction price; and (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations, which in our case consists of delivering Korlym to the customer; and (v) recognize revenue once Korlym has been delivered, provided we deem it probable that we will collect the payment due to us. To determine net product revenue, we deduct from sales the cost of our patient co-pay assistance program and our estimates of (a) government chargebacks and rebates, (b) discounts provided to our SD for prompt payment and (c) reserves for expected Korlym returns. We then (i) deduct this reserve from revenue in the period to which the rebates relate and (ii) include in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet a current liability of equal amount. The SD recovers such discounts by reducing its payment to us (this reduction is called a “chargeback”). We deduct from our revenue in each period chargebacks claimed by the SD for Korlym we sold to the SD that period. Getting an accounts system up and running often involved countless hours poring over thousands of pages of illegible and inaccurate hand-written accounts in traditional ledger books. This is where the journal entry features came in really useful in order to bypass having to enter thousands of useless historical records, it was possible to reach an agreement with the accountants as to what figures should be given an initial fudge factor in order to artificially balance the software ledgers prior to going live with the new accounts system.

The Company is the Lipid Management Company, a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing complementary, convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants\n\nAs of July 31, 2018, the registrant had 42,026,390 shares of common stock outstanding. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We are expensing costs associated with the manufacture of our lebrikizumab product candidate. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional accounting.

Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year. Research and development expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $604,574 compared to $488,577 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. For the second quarter ended October 31, 2012, the Company reported a net loss of $1,557,278, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,929,923, or $0.12 per share, for the same period in the prior year.

The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses.

Cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing Korlym, including materials, third-party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs, based on the number of Korlym tablets for which we recognize revenue, as well as costs of stability testing, logistics and distribution. We classify inventory we do not expect to consume within 12 months of the balance sheet date as strategic inventory, a noncurrent asset. Accounting for the Financing Agreement required us to estimate the amount of each future quarterly payment and the accretion of interest expense. To determine our revenue from the sale of Korlym, we (i) identify our contract with each customer; (ii) identify the obligations of Corcept and the customer under the contract; (iii) determine the contracted transaction price; and (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations, which in our case consists of delivering Korlym to the customer; and (v) recognize revenue once Korlym has been delivered, provided we deem it probable that we will collect the payment due to us. To determine net product revenue, we deduct from sales the cost of our patient co-pay assistance program and our estimates of (a) government chargebacks and rebates, (b) discounts provided to our SD for prompt payment and (c) reserves for expected Korlym returns. We then (i) deduct this reserve from revenue in the period to which the rebates relate and (ii) include in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet a current liability of equal amount.

At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license.\n\n"
