In some cases, for example, if the mother has epilepsy or diabetes, the risk of stopping a medication may be worse than risks associated with taking the medication while pregnant. In addition to medications and substances, some dietary supplements are important for a healthy pregnancy, however, others may cause harm to the unborn child. Of those who bear children, recreational drug use can have serious consequences to the health of not only the mother, but also the fetus as many medications can cross the placenta and reach the fetus. Some of the consequences on the babies include physical abnormalities, higher risk of stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and others. Medications Some medications can cause harm to the unborn baby, but in some instances the benefits may outweigh the risks to the baby or mother. Medications used to treat diabetes Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy and can accordingly cause high blood sugar that affects the woman and the baby. The safety of these medications vary by class and by strength. There is no established association with teratogenicity or elevated occurrence of birth defects and the usage of acetaminophen at any point during a pregnancy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) Ibuprofen and naproxen have not frequently been studied during pregnancy, but recent studies do not show increased risk of spontaneous abortion within the first six weeks of pregnancy. However, its usage during organogenesis and the third trimester can lead to elevated risk of intrauterine growth retardation and maternal hemorrhage. Evidence is conflicting for carbamazepine regarding any increased risk of congenital physical anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders by intrauterine exposure. Similarly, children exposed to lamotrigine or phenytoin in the womb do not seem to differ in their skills compared to those who were exposed to carbamazepine. Antacids Heartburn is a common symptom of late term pregnancy during which up to 80% of pregnant women have experienced it by the end of their third trimester. Common antacids include aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (Maalox) and calcium carbonate (Tums). Aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, when consumed, do not cross the placenta and are regarded as safe pharmacological options to treat heartburn, since there are no significant association with maldevelopment or injury to fetus. Pregnancy increases the risk of clot formation in women due to elevated levels of certain clotting factors and compounds in the body, and the risk increases even more immediately after birth and remains elevated up to 3 months after delivery. Anticoagulants must be prescribed with caution as these medications can have negative health consequences for the developing baby and need to consider dosing and medication management options. In pregnant women, warfarin is contraindicated and should be avoided as it crosses the placental barrier. Additionally, warfarin is listed as Pregnancy Category D, which means it has a risk of harming the fetus. However, pregnant women taking LMWH may not experience the full anticoagulant effect due to the nature of the medication compared to other anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin) and may be less favorable for users as it is an injectable medication.

Exposure to Harmful Substances (Teratogens): A teratogen is any substance that can cause or increase the chance of a birth defect. Most pregnant women who are exposed to teratogens have newborns without abnormalities. Whether a birth defect occurs depends on when, how much, and how long the pregnant woman was exposed to the teratogen. Exposure to a teratogen most commonly affects the fetal organ that is developing most rapidly at the time of exposure. For example, exposure to a teratogen during the time that certain parts of the brain are developing is more likely to cause a defect in those areas than exposure before or after this critical period. Nutrition: Keeping a fetus healthy requires maintaining a nutritious diet. However, many birth defects are caused by seemingly random and unexplained changes (mutations) in the genes of the child.Infections: Certain infections in pregnant women can cause birth defects.Whether an infection causes a birth defect depends on the age of the fetus.The infections that most often cause birth defects are cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus (fifth disease), rubella (German measles), varicella (chicken* * * pox), toxoplasmosis (which can be transmitted in cat litter), and syphilis.

Anticoagulants must be prescribed with caution as these medications can have negative health consequences for the developing baby and need to consider dosing and medication management options. In pregnant women, warfarin is contraindicated and should be avoided as it crosses the placental barrier. Additionally, warfarin is listed as Pregnancy Category D, which means it has a risk of harming the fetus. However, pregnant women taking LMWH may not experience the full anticoagulant effect due to the nature of the medication compared to other anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin) and may be less favorable for users as it is an injectable medication. UFH is classified as Pregnancy Category C, which means animal studies have shown potential for adverse effects to the fetus; however, there needs to be more studies done to confirm the presence of a risk to the fetus. Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) Direct oral anticoagulants are newer types of anticoagulants that are available as oral medications and are widely used in non-pregnant populations.

Exposure to Harmful Substances (Teratogens): A teratogen is any substance that can cause or increase the chance of a birth defect. Most pregnant women who are exposed to teratogens have newborns without abnormalities. Whether a birth defect occurs depends on when, how much, and how long the pregnant woman was exposed to the teratogen. Exposure to a teratogen most commonly affects the fetal organ that is developing most rapidly at the time of exposure. For example, exposure to a teratogen during the time that certain parts of the brain are developing is more likely to cause a defect in those areas than exposure before or after this critical period. Nutrition: Keeping a fetus healthy requires maintaining a nutritious diet. However, many birth defects are caused by seemingly random and unexplained changes (mutations) in the genes of the child.Infections: Certain infections in pregnant women can cause birth defects.Whether an infection causes a birth defect depends on the age of the fetus.The infections that most often cause birth defects are cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus (fifth disease), rubella (German measles), varicella (chicken* * * pox), toxoplasmosis (which can be transmitted in cat litter), and syphilis.

In this case the client is regressed and helped to recall a ‘past life’. It involves the experience of an altered psychological state allowing the client to be more receptive and responsive to the suggestion of inner experiences. During the therapy a client may recall a true/actual past life or they may construct a confabulation based upon cryptomnesia, or a reconstruction of archetypal images representing an actual event in their life. Either way it is down to the therapist to carefully analyse the evidence and use it to direct the clients subconscious mind into resolving whatever trauma or issue that has lead to the current situation. This is where the therapist gains valuable client details such as contact information and medical details and also identifies the clients need for past life therapy. Usually the presenting issue will fall under one of three headings, a past life traumatic event, a negative act carried out by the client or a commitment/contract made by the client. A preliminary meeting is also a perfect time for the client to gain an insight into past life therapy, ask questions and then decide if it’s right for them. Past life recall can be down to reincarnation, this is where the body dies but the mind continues on and is reborn into another body again and again until the spirit attains complete self-realization and gives up its identification. Once abreaction occurs and there is a discharge of the emotions involved in reliving and recalling the traumatic event the client is free of the repression and all the neurosis caused by it. So during regression it is possible for the client to describe a past life out of a series of primordial images to create a symbolic story giving clues to the true unconscious repressed memories. A therapist must ensure their scripts have the inclusion of synonyms, para phrased suggestions, connective words, time designations and plenty of repetition. The therapist will also never interpret or add to details produced by the client as the clients unconscious mind will latch onto it and fabricate a story with false memories. This involves the therapist redirecting the clients focus of conscious attention and then making suggestions to the subconscious mind to relax. The therapist now gets the client to use visual imagery to help them accept suggestions to enter a deeper level of hypnosis. Once the client has achieved this deeper level they are now ready for therapeutic intervention. The therapist now makes beneficial suggestions which are immediately accepted by the conscious mind. The revisiting of a past life can be done either by the client choosing to re-experience it first hand through the eyes of the past life persona or by third person from the side lines. Therapeutic intervention is designed to get to the root of the presenting problem by aiding the client to ‘relive’ past lives and then identify the event where the trauma or contract occurred. This may involve the client experiencing a traumatic death scene, it is the therapists role to guide them to just before the defining event and through it to the other side. The client needs to go through to a point beyond death in order to commence an evaluation of that life. Once the client has under gone suggestive therapy and experienced their past lives they can be released from their hypnotic state. Before releasing them the therapist double checks that the client has resolved all that needs to be resolved and then closes out of the session by applying the following routine. Remove any and all unwanted suggestions, Inform the client that they will return to the present refreshed, instruct the client to remember what he/she did and inform the client that they will be able to return to this state easily and without effort whenever they feel it appropriate to do so. Past life therapy can be beneficial in many areas: phobias, irrational fears, health problems, removing the fear of death, family and relationship dysfunctions, addictions and disorders. It can help a client to develop their potential and unlock their latent talents, to create a better understanding of others and reveal their life purpose and their reason for reincarnating. Past life therapy creates a sense of knowing and accepting oneself as a spiritual being. It teaches clients that conditions we encounter in our present life are not simply a punishment for ‘bad karma’ or misdeeds in a former life but that we can inflict misery on ourselves as a way of releasing guilt from a past life. In psychotherapy counseling, the therapist guides their client towards uninhibited emotional disclosure. Numerous studies have shown that emotional disclosure strengthens the immune system by increasing the levels of CD4 cells and natural killer cells and improves the health of individuals afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and other conditions. In psychotherapy, also referred to as counseling, psychosocial therapy, therapy or talk therapy, a mental health professional assists a client with personal growth, behavioral issues, or mental health problems. Psychotherapists perform a holistic analysis of their clients' situation and implement coping strategies. Psychotherapy may be short-term or consist of numerous sessions over the course of several years. In this intensive, long-term therapy, counselors help clients examine feelings, events, and memories from the past in order to shed light on present behaviors and emotions. Patients usually attend several weekly psychoanalytical sessions for extended periods of time. In this form of treatment, the psychotherapist helps clients become cognizant of any unconscious influence that past experiences may have on their present lives by way of thoughts, emotions or behaviors. Some techniques employed in this typically brief treatment include analyzing actions and thoughts, confronting behavior and beliefs, resolving conflicts, and re-visiting the past. In cognitive therapy, patients are taught to identify and modify cognitive distortions. This type of psychoanalytical treatment tends to focus more on the present and future than on past conflicts or issues. Psychotherapists often apply this treatment method when working with young children, in that it facilitates emotional expression on the part of the latter who are not cognitively-developed to express themselves verbally. This form of psychotherapy treatment is especially useful in treating individuals afflicted with a chronic and severe mental illness. In creative art therapy, a psychotherapist helps clients communicate their thoughts and emotions through the vehicle of poetry, painting, drawing, drama, dance, music, and other creative arts. This type of psychotherapy enables patients to cope with trauma and symptoms, implement positive changes, and gain a better understanding of themselves. Gestalt practitioners teach mindfulness skills, using a wide variety of methods not limited by the psychotherapeutic model. All Gestalt Practice techniques emphasize experience over analysis. Besides the standard Gestalt exercises that characterized Gestalt therapy, Dick Price widened the approach by incorporating novel techniques from such disciplines as meditation, shamanism, compassion practice and spiritual contemplation. Thus, Gestalt Practice became a personalized form of consciousness exploration beyond the limits of psychotherapy. A partial list of the modalities used in Gestalt Practice includes the following: Gestalt Practice work may involve the reporting of present awareness, and the integration of awareness through intrapsychic dialogue between aspects of personality.

An implicit memory activity developed by Siegel, involving the recalling of a recent pleasant experience e.g. For instance, a client who drinks in response to conflicts with a partner and children might be taught how to communicate more effectively with family members, so that these conflicts can be resolved before they cause anger or anxiety. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, or REBT, was developed by Dr. Albert Ellis of the Ellis Institute in the 1950s. In addition to teaching the client practical ways to resolve problems and cope with stressors, REBT helps the client learn how to regulate emotions in order to achieve a more balanced, realistic outlook. This form of therapy is practiced most successfully by psychologists, therapists, and other mental health practitioners who have studied this approach to treatment on a professional level. The therapist’s attitude is encouraging, collaborative, and non-confrontational. The therapist helps the client envision a better future and develop strategies for achieving it. Although the therapist facilitates and encourages change, it is the client’s role to accept the need for recovery. MI is a very optimistic, present-focused counseling style that has been adopted by many therapists, social workers, and other professionals in the field of substance abuse treatment. Even though one member of the household may be the focus of treatment, all members of the group must be engaged in treatment in order for them to recover. However, it is often difficult for the individual to access these memories or to bring the associated feelings to a satisfactory resolution. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR, is a unique therapy that aims to resolve traumatic memories through rapid movements of the eyes. In a series of sessions, therapists trained in EMDR guide clients through disturbing memories while having clients move their eyes rapidly back and forth under closed eyelids. Since its development by Dr. Francine Shapiro of the Shapiro Institute, EMDR has provided relief from the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric conditions associated with trauma. After a series of sessions, many clients report that these memories are no longer as powerful or vivid, and that they find it easier to relax, to sleep, and to avoid abusing drugs or alcohol. However, this therapy can be valuable for any rehab client who has difficulty overcoming disturbing memories or coping with fear and anxiety. Seeking Safety integrates treatment for substance abuse with therapy for PTSD, so both issues are addressed at the same time, giving the client a sense of continuity and establishing a sense of trust.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional psychology.

        "context": "Past life therapy is a sub modality of hypnotherapy, it is the therapeutic treatment introduced whilst a client is in a state of hypnosis. In this case the client is regressed and helped to recall a ‘past life’. It involves the experience of an altered psychological state allowing the client to be more receptive and responsive to the suggestion of inner experiences. During the therapy a client may recall a true/actual past life or they may construct a confabulation based upon cryptomnesia, or a reconstruction of archetypal images representing an actual event in their life. Either way it is down to the therapist to carefully analyse the evidence and use it to direct the clients subconscious mind into resolving whatever trauma or issue that has lead to the current situation. This is where the therapist gains valuable client details such as contact information and medical details and also identifies the clients need for past life therapy. Usually the presenting issue will fall under one of three headings, a past life traumatic event, a negative act carried out by the client or a commitment/contract made by the client. A preliminary meeting is also a perfect time for the client to gain an insight into past life therapy, ask questions and then decide if it’s right for them. Past life recall can be down to reincarnation, this is where the body dies but the mind continues on and is reborn into another body again and again until the spirit attains complete self-realization and gives up its identification. Once abreaction occurs and there is a discharge of the emotions involved in reliving and recalling the traumatic event the client is free of the repression and all the neurosis caused by it. So during regression it is possible for the client to describe a past life out of a series of primordial images to create a symbolic story giving clues to the true unconscious repressed memories. A therapist must ensure their scripts have the inclusion of synonyms, para phrased suggestions, connective words, time designations and plenty of repetition. The therapist will also never interpret or add to details produced by the client as the clients unconscious mind will latch onto it and fabricate a story with false memories. This involves the therapist redirecting the clients focus of conscious attention and then making suggestions to the subconscious mind to relax. The therapist now gets the client to use visual imagery to help them accept suggestions to enter a deeper level of hypnosis. Once the client has achieved this deeper level they are now ready for therapeutic intervention. The therapist now makes beneficial suggestions which are immediately accepted by the conscious mind. The revisiting of a past life can be done either by the client choosing to re-experience it first hand through the eyes of the past life persona or by third person from the side lines. Therapeutic intervention is designed to get to the root of the presenting problem by aiding the client to ‘relive’ past lives and then identify the event where the trauma or contract occurred. This may involve the client experiencing a traumatic death scene, it is the therapists role to guide them to just before the defining event and through it to the other side. The client needs to go through to a point beyond death in order to commence an evaluation of that life. Once the client has under gone suggestive therapy and experienced their past lives they can be released from their hypnotic state. Before releasing them the therapist double checks that the client has resolved all that needs to be resolved and then closes out of the session by applying the following routine. Remove any and all unwanted suggestions, Inform the client that they will return to the present refreshed, instruct the client to remember what he/she did and inform the client that they will be able to return to this state easily and without effort whenever they feel it appropriate to do so. Past life therapy can be beneficial in many areas: phobias, irrational fears, health problems, removing the fear of death, family and relationship dysfunctions, addictions and disorders. It can help a client to develop their potential and unlock their latent talents, to create a better understanding of others and reveal their life purpose and their reason for reincarnating. Past life therapy creates a sense of knowing and accepting oneself as a spiritual being. It teaches clients that conditions we encounter in our present life are not simply a punishment for ‘bad karma’ or misdeeds in a former life but that we can inflict misery on ourselves as a way of releasing guilt from a past life. In psychotherapy counseling, the therapist guides their client towards uninhibited emotional disclosure. Numerous studies have shown that emotional disclosure strengthens the immune system by increasing the levels of CD4 cells and natural killer cells and improves the health of individuals afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and other conditions. In psychotherapy, also referred to as counseling, psychosocial therapy, therapy or talk therapy, a mental health professional assists a client with personal growth, behavioral issues, or mental health problems. Psychotherapists perform a holistic analysis of their clients' situation and implement coping strategies. Psychotherapy may be short-term or consist of numerous sessions over the course of several years. In this intensive, long-term therapy, counselors help clients examine feelings, events, and memories from the past in order to shed light on present behaviors and emotions. Patients usually attend several weekly psychoanalytical sessions for extended periods of time. In this form of treatment, the psychotherapist helps clients become cognizant of any unconscious influence that past experiences may have on their present lives by way of thoughts, emotions or behaviors. Some techniques employed in this typically brief treatment include analyzing actions and thoughts, confronting behavior and beliefs, resolving conflicts, and re-visiting the past. In cognitive therapy, patients are taught to identify and modify cognitive distortions. This type of psychoanalytical treatment tends to focus more on the present and future than on past conflicts or issues. Psychotherapists often apply this treatment method when working with young children, in that it facilitates emotional expression on the part of the latter who are not cognitively-developed to express themselves verbally. This form of psychotherapy treatment is especially useful in treating individuals afflicted with a chronic and severe mental illness. In creative art therapy, a psychotherapist helps clients communicate their thoughts and emotions through the vehicle of poetry, painting, drawing, drama, dance, music, and other creative arts. This type of psychotherapy enables patients to cope with trauma and symptoms, implement positive changes, and gain a better understanding of themselves. Gestalt practitioners teach mindfulness skills, using a wide variety of methods not limited by the psychotherapeutic model. All Gestalt Practice techniques emphasize experience over analysis. Besides the standard Gestalt exercises that characterized Gestalt therapy, Dick Price widened the approach by incorporating novel techniques from such disciplines as meditation, shamanism, compassion practice and spiritual contemplation. Thus, Gestalt Practice became a personalized form of consciousness exploration beyond the limits of psychotherapy.

Mode of actions Effects on the hippocampus Alcohol acts as a general central nervous system depressant, but it also affects some specific areas of the brain to a greater extent than others. Memory impairment caused by alcohol has been linked to the disruption of hippocampal function—particularly affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission which negatively impacts long-term potentiation (LTP). Particularly, damage to hippocampal CA1 cells adversely affects memory formation, and this disruption has been linked to dose-dependent levels of alcohol consumption. At higher doses, alcohol significantly inhibits neuronal activity in both the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus. This impairs memory encoding, since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formations of new memories. Both chronic alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence are correlated with the altered expression, properties, and functions of the GABAA receptor that may contribute to alcohol tolerance. Therefore, this inhibition of an ion current usually produced by NMDAR activation leads to decreased LTP in hippocampal areas. In adolescents, alcohol decreases the expression of both the NMDAR NR2A subunit in the hippocampus and the NR1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found that a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, and the striatum. These changes prevent excitatory synaptic transmissions from occurring, affecting synaptic plasticity and, in turn, memory and learning. However, there is still much yet to be elucidated concerning specific molecular mechanisms of how alcohol affects memory formation. Effects on other brain regions Alcohol also impairs and alters the functioning in the cerebellum, which affects both motor function and coordination. It has a notable inhibitory effect on the neurons of the cerebral cortex, affecting and altering thought processes, decreasing inhibition, and increasing the pain threshold. Long-term memory Long-term memory (LTM) has both a long duration and a large capacity. First of all, in the encoding stage, information from the senses is incorporated into mental activity in the form of a memory. Lastly, retrieval is the ability to recall information from the long-term memory storage. It includes both episodic memory (for specific events, such as a party) and semantic memory (for general information, such as one's name). Alcohol impairs episodic encoding, specifically for cued recall, recognition of completed word fragments, and free recall. This distortion impairs a person's ability to form new episodic memories. High doses of alcohol severely disrupt the storage process of semantic memories. Since alcohol affects the central nervous system, it hinders semantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the information from encoding. When compared to sober participants, intoxicated participants performed quite poorly on a recall task for everyday events (i.e., episodic memory). Alcohol also impairs retrieval in word recognition tasks. In terms of gender differences in retrieval processes, females tend to score lower than males on recall tasks when intoxicated. It occurs when previous experience influences performance on a certain task. While retrieval of explicit memory is severely impaired by alcohol, retrieval of implicit memory is not. Brain areas affected by alcohol Alcohol affects the functioning of the brain. Neurochemical changes occurring in the anterior cingulate are correlated with altered short-term memory functions in the brains of young alcoholic men. This is supported by findings of short-term memory impairment by lesions of both the parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex. Associations between third ventricle volume and cognitive performance on memory tests have been found in alcoholics. Specifically, increases in third ventricular volume correlate with a decline in memory performance. Tasks and intoxication findings Short-term memory is commonly tested with visual tasks. Short-term memory, especially for non-verbal and spatial material, are impaired by intoxication. Alcohol decreases iconic memory (a type of visual short-term memory). With BACs between 80–84 mg/dl, more intrusion errors occur in a delayed recall task compared to a control group. Free recall (given list of words then asked to recall list) is significantly lower and therefore impaired by alcohol intoxication. Ethanol can impair different types of memory.

A discrimination task found significant alcohol-related impairments\n\nHenry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 – December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His case played a very important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the 1–2-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio. In this way, his case was taken to provide information about brain pathology, and helped to form theories of normal memory function. In particular, his apparent ability to complete tasks that require recall from short-term memory and procedural memory but not long-term episodic memory suggests that recall from these memory systems may be mediated, at least in part, by different areas of the brain. Similarly, his ability to recall long-term memories that existed well before his surgery, but inability to create new long-term memories, suggests that encoding and retrieval of long-term memory information may also be mediated by distinct systems. It has provided broad evidence for the rejection of old theories and the formation of new theories on human memory, in particular about its processes and the underlying neural structures (cf. Further evidence for this assumption has been gained by studies of other patients with lesions of their medial temporal lobe structures. Despite his amnesic symptoms, Molaison performed quite normally in tests of intellectual ability, indicating that some memory functions (e.g., short-term memories, stores for words, phonemes, etc.) However, for sentence-level language comprehension and production, Molaison exhibited the same deficits and sparing as in memory. This was tested in a working memory experiment involving the recall of previously presented numbers; in fact, his performance was no worse than that of control subjects (Smith & Kosslyn, 2007). It further supports the general distinction between short-term and long-term stores of memory). These findings provide evidence that memory of skills and repetition priming rely on different neural structures than memories of episodes and facts; whereas procedural memory and repetition priming do not rely on the medial temporal structures removed from Molaison, semantic and episodic memory do (cf. This finding is remarkable since Molaison had moved to the house five years after his surgery and hence, given his severe anterograde amnesia and insights from other cases, the common expectation was that the acquisition of topographical memories would have been impaired as well.

It occurs when previous experience influences performance on a certain task. While retrieval of explicit memory is severely impaired by alcohol, retrieval of implicit memory is not. Brain areas affected by alcohol Alcohol affects the functioning of the brain. Neurochemical changes occurring in the anterior cingulate are correlated with altered short-term memory functions in the brains of young alcoholic men. This is supported by findings of short-term memory impairment by lesions of both the parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex. Associations between third ventricle volume and cognitive performance on memory tests have been found in alcoholics. Specifically, increases in third ventricular volume correlate with a decline in memory performance. Tasks and intoxication findings Short-term memory is commonly tested with visual tasks. Short-term memory, especially for non-verbal and spatial material, are impaired by intoxication. Alcohol decreases iconic memory (a type of visual short-term memory). With BACs between 80–84 mg/dl, more intrusion errors occur in a delayed recall task compared to a control group. Free recall (given list of words then asked to recall list) is significantly lower and therefore impaired by alcohol intoxication. Ethanol can impair different types of memory. Mode of actions Effects on the hippocampus Alcohol acts as a general central nervous system depressant, but it also affects some specific areas of the brain to a greater extent than others. Memory impairment caused by alcohol has been linked to the disruption of hippocampal function—particularly affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission which negatively impacts long-term potentiation (LTP). Particularly, damage to hippocampal CA1 cells adversely affects memory formation, and this disruption has been linked to dose-dependent levels of alcohol consumption. At higher doses, alcohol significantly inhibits neuronal activity in both the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus. This impairs memory encoding, since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formations of new memories. Both chronic alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence are correlated with the altered expression, properties, and functions of the GABAA receptor that may contribute to alcohol tolerance. Therefore, this inhibition of an ion current usually produced by NMDAR activation leads to decreased LTP in hippocampal areas. In adolescents, alcohol decreases the expression of both the NMDAR NR2A subunit in the hippocampus and the NR1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found that a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, and the striatum. These changes prevent excitatory synaptic transmissions from occurring, affecting synaptic plasticity and, in turn, memory and learning. However, there is still much yet to be elucidated concerning specific molecular mechanisms of how alcohol affects memory formation. Effects on other brain regions Alcohol also impairs and alters the functioning in the cerebellum, which affects both motor function and coordination. It has a notable inhibitory effect on the neurons of the cerebral cortex, affecting and altering thought processes, decreasing inhibition, and increasing the pain threshold. Long-term memory Long-term memory (LTM) has both a long duration and a large capacity. First of all, in the encoding stage, information from the senses is incorporated into mental activity in the form of a memory. Lastly, retrieval is the ability to recall information from the long-term memory storage. It includes both episodic memory (for specific events, such as a party) and semantic memory (for general information, such as one's name). Alcohol impairs episodic encoding, specifically for cued recall, recognition of completed word fragments, and free recall. This distortion impairs a person's ability to form new episodic memories. High doses of alcohol severely disrupt the storage process of semantic memories. Since alcohol affects the central nervous system, it hinders semantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the information from encoding.

A discrimination task found significant alcohol-related impairments\n\nHenry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 – December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His case played a very important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the 1–2-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio. In this way, his case was taken to provide information about brain pathology, and helped to form theories of normal memory function. In particular, his apparent ability to complete tasks that require recall from short-term memory and procedural memory but not long-term episodic memory suggests that recall from these memory systems may be mediated, at least in part, by different areas of the brain. Similarly, his ability to recall long-term memories that existed well before his surgery, but inability to create new long-term memories, suggests that encoding and retrieval of long-term memory information may also be mediated by distinct systems. It has provided broad evidence for the rejection of old theories and the formation of new theories on human memory, in particular about its processes and the underlying neural structures (cf. Further evidence for this assumption has been gained by studies of other patients with lesions of their medial temporal lobe structures. Despite his amnesic symptoms, Molaison performed quite normally in tests of intellectual ability, indicating that some memory functions (e.g., short-term memories, stores for words, phonemes, etc.) However, for sentence-level language comprehension and production, Molaison exhibited the same deficits and sparing as in memory. This was tested in a working memory experiment involving the recall of previously presented numbers; in fact, his performance was no worse than that of control subjects (Smith & Kosslyn, 2007). It further supports the general distinction between short-term and long-term stores of memory). These findings provide evidence that memory of skills and repetition priming rely on different neural structures than memories of episodes and facts; whereas procedural memory and repetition priming do not rely on the medial temporal structures removed from Molaison, semantic and episodic memory do (cf. This finding is remarkable since Molaison had moved to the house five years after his surgery and hence, given his severe anterograde amnesia and insights from other cases, the common expectation was that the acquisition of topographical memories would have been impaired as well. Ethanol can impair different types of memory.

Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a rare disease in which parts of the brain become damaged and begin to shrink. The outer layer of the brain, known as the cortex, and deep parts of the brain, called the basal ganglia, are both affected. The first symptoms that people with CBD experience are problems with movement, such as stiffness and jerkiness in one or more of their limbs and a failure to control hand movement on one side (known as 'alien hand syndrome'). Many people experience symptoms of dementia, including problems with memory and thinking. A small proportion of people with frontotemporal dementia also develop CBD as an 'overlapping' condition. Other symptoms of CBD include loss of balance and co-ordination, and difficulties speaking and swallowing. Currently, there is no cure or treatment available to slow the progression of CBD, but drugs may help some symptoms and physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy may be beneficial. Early symptoms include minor lapses of memory, mood changes and loss of interest. Symptoms progress to jerky movements, shakiness, stiffness of limbs, incontinence and loss of the ability to move or speak. In a small number of patients the disease may take longer to run its course. If no immediate diagnosis is obvious, the neurologist may conclude that the person has a rare neurodegenerative disease - a type of disease that affects the nervous system and gets worse over time - and may refer them to the National Prion Clinic in London for further assessment (see 'Other useful organisations'). This is known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Difficulties with memory, thinking and reasoning (aspects of cognition) are common with HIV, but they are usually mild and dementia is much rarer. Neurocognitive disorders in people with HIV may be caused by the virus directly damaging the brain. Symptoms may include problems with short-term memory, learning, speed of thinking, difficulties with concentration and decision making, unsteadiness and mood changes. These mild impairments do not amount to dementia. This is because the symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, such as depression. Huntington's disease is an inherited disease causing abnormal movements and problems with coordination. Other symptoms include mood problems and cognitive impairment that gets progressively worse over time. Symptoms of dementia associated with Huntington's disease mainly include difficulties with concentration, planning and organisational skills. People with Huntington's disease may also develop obsessive behaviour. Some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience a loss of some of their mental abilities. This happens if damage caused by the MS occurs in certain parts of the brain. The mental abilities most likely to be affected are memory, concentration and problem solving. They may also experience emotional problems, such as mood swings and personality changes. The term 'dementia' is not generally used in association with multiple sclerosis because the decline is not usually as severe as it is in other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. It is more usual to describe the person as 'experiencing cognitive difficulties'. It is not related to frontotemporal dementia, which is also sometimes called Pick's disease. Symptoms include difficulties with walking, dementia and urinary incontinence. People with Parkinson's disease have a higher-than-average risk of developing dementia, although around two thirds of people are unaffected. Parkinson's disease dementia accounts for around 2 per cent of all cases of dementia in the UK. Symptoms of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease vary from person to person. The person's symptoms vary and can seem better or worse at different times. It is thought that Parkinson's disease dementia results from microscopic deposits known as Lewy bodies, located in nerve cells in the brain stem (the lower part of the brain just above the spinal cord). As Parkinson's disease progresses, Lewy bodies spread beyond the brain\n\nExplore the similarities and differences between two common degenerative brain disorders. Sara is forgetting things more often even though her Parkinson’s disease symptoms appear to be under good control with standard medications, healthy diet, and plenty of physical activity. Is that a part of Parkinson’s disease? And what are the differences between Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s? Parkinson’s disease (PD) was described by James Parkinson nearly 100 years before Dr. Alois Alzheimer described the dementia later named Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Called the “shaking palsy” by Parkinson, PD is diagnosed when a person shows at least two of these three symptoms: slowed movements (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, and tremor (at rest). We recognize many other associated signs of PD, including expressionless face, quiet speech, cramped handwriting, shuffling gait, trouble getting out of a chair, and difficulty swallowing. Most cases are called “idiopathic,” meaning the cause remains unknown, although a small number of cases are linked with reversible toxic medication effects (antipsychotics and some anti-vomiting medications), poisoning (certain pesticides, manganese, carbon monoxide), head trauma, or more complex PD-like neurological disorders (such as vascular parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multiple system atrophy). With a prevalence of around 3 cases per 1,000 people, PD is less common than AD but still an important cause of neurological illness among older adults. Cognitive decline is common in both AD and PD, though significantly less common in PD. The dementia of PD is called “subcortical” because of the location of affected brain areas, and subcortical dementias have somewhat different clinical symptoms than a “cortical” dementia like AD. In PD dementia, slowed physical activity can be accompanied by slowed thinking and by problems with memory that are more responsive to reminders than those of AD because the difficulty is with memory retrieval rather than, as in AD, with storage of new learning. Just like people with AD, people with PD can also develop behavioral problems. Apathy is a common development in both diseases, and so is depression. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell these syndromes apart but it’s important to try because they are managed differently. Anxiety is common to both PD and AD, and may require behavioral treatment, lowering of AD or PD medications, or addition of antidepressant or antianxiety medications—keeping in mind that both conditions leave patients vulnerable to medication side effects. In both disorders, these symptoms may indicate delirium caused by infection or other medical conditions. In PD patients, an additional risk for psychotic symptoms is added by the medications that treat movement disorder symptoms. Finally, the quality of sleep deteriorates in both AD and PD. AD patients often have fragmented sleep, while PD patients experience a different problem called REM (rapid eye movement) behavior disorder, in which physical activity occurs during the normally motionless period of REM sleep. REM behavior disorder can respond to treatment with clonazepam, a medication that would usually be avoided in AD because of concern about effects on memory and alertness. Some older adults develop movement symptoms similar to those of PD after, or only shortly before, developing cognitive difficulties that look like AD. This combination of movement and cognitive changes is characteristic of the disease considered by some to be the second most common dementia: Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). As its name suggests, LBD is a condition in which cognitive decline is very prominent, sometimes much more prominent than movement symptoms, yet the microscopic brain findings are those similar to PD. Whether LBD is truly a different condition than PD with dementia or is a variant of the same disorder remains a topic under debate, although the finding of increased beta amyloid deposits (amyloid plaques) in the brains of people with LBD has suggested a difference between these conditions. The symptoms of LBD can include dramatic fluctuations in cognitive functioning as well as falls and psychotic symptoms. Similar to patients with PD and even more than patients with AD, standard antipsychotic treatment is often complicated by severe toxic reactions. The cognitive enhancers used in AD, however, can play a useful role in treating LBD. Distinguishing between different types of neurodegenerative conditions is important: it helps in determining the best treatment approach. Sara’s further testing identified mild cognitive impairment symptoms that are probably related to her PD but exacerbated by one of the medications she has been taking. Her mental clarity improved a little with adjustment of that medication. Although PD-related cognitive changes could get worse over time, there is no sign that she is developing AD and in fact at this point there is no diagnosis of dementia.

Having a basic map of the brain and an elementary understanding about what each part is responsible for can help you to communicate with medical professionals. A caution: while this section aims to provide you with a basic “map” of the brain, be aware that the brain is an intricately complex organ. This section is intended to provide a layman’s reference and it is and intentionally drastically simplified conception of how the brain works. The outside part of the brain is called the cortex or the cerebrum. The parietal lobe is associated with touch, pain and temperature. The limbic system, referred to as the “emotional brain” is deep inside the brain and includes four structures: the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The thalamus helps control attention span and it monitors sensations the body is feeling, including pain. The hippocampus is involved in converting working memory to long term memory. Typically, STM is profoundly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike short-term memory, LTM typically remains reasonably intact for someone experiencing Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s affects working memory, so that someone experiencing Alzheimer’s disease might get “lost” in a task, needing a caregiver to support and cue them throughout the process. Alzheimer’s disease impairs semantic memory for some people, but for others it can remain relatively intact. Individuals with Alzheimer’s commonly feel anxiety, in large part because short term memory loss means that the person’s expectations and reality are not matching up. This is a term used frequently by social workers, occupational therapists, and other professionals who assess a person’s ability to maintain a good quality of life autonomously. Basic ADL’s include bathing, dressing, self-feeding, personal hygiene and grooming, toileting, and functional mobility (the ability to get in and out of a bed or chair, and to navigate safely though space). Instrumental ADL’s are more complex processes, including housework, meal preparation, taking medication, managing money, shopping, transportation, taking care of others, and using the telephone. Like dementia, cognitive loss is a descriptive term. For others, it marks the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer’s or a related dementia. A disease is called degenerative when it gets worse over time. Doctors use mental status testing to determine whether a patient has cognitive decline that indicates the presence of dementia symptoms. These are question-and-answer tests (written or oral) that assess your brain’s ability to process and retain information at the time the test was\n\nYour Elderly Client: Is She Really Suffering From Dementia? One of the most common misdiagnoses in mental health is that of dementia. This is not to say that dementia is not a real illness, or that the elderly do not suffer from it in great numbers, but it is to say that clients are not infrequently diagnosed as being demented when in fact they are really depressed. Or they may be both demented and depressed. The reason for this diagnostic confusion is that many of the symptoms of the two illnesses are similar, if not identical. But since depression is treatable (whereas most forms of dementia are not), it is critical that a careful, accurate and thorough assessment be made of the elderly client. Depression and dementia are two of the most common of all psychiatric disorders in those 65 years old and older. They’re often very difficult to tell apart, and depression is not infrequently mistakenly diagnosed as dementia. from a stroke, or a vitamin deficiency, or an endocrine disorder or from HIV or Parkinson’s Disease. Sometimes, as is the case with Alzheimer’s Dementia, the underlying cause is not known. Both the depressed and demented client are likely to show impairments in thinking and memory. The depressed person, however, is far more likely to acknowledge cognitive impairment, whereas the demented person is more likely to try to minimize any problems. Depressed people are more likely to complain about their poor memory. They are more likely to have fluctuations in their thinking abilities, and the onset of their symptoms is more sudden. However, it is very important to note that persons with dementia can also be clinically depressed. If the client is younger than 50 years old and is displaying symptoms of dementia, it’s most likely due to alcoholism or AIDS. If the client is older than 50, the incidence of dementia increases markedly, and it’s most commonly due to problems in metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, Parkinson’s Disease, alcoholism or stroke (a.k.a. The symptoms most commonly associated with depression (i.e. They are often apathetic towards life and seem emotionally “flat.” This different presentation of depression in the elderly is one key reason why the diagnosis is sometimes missed and the symptoms attributed to other causes. So how can anyone be sure what the correct diagnosis is? The only certain way is a comprehensive psychological or neuropsychological evaluation which includes psychological testing, a thorough taking of the client’s history and gathering of collateral information from others who know the client well. The consequences of not conducting an exhaustive evaluation can be dire indeed, and could result in an unnecessary loss of autonomy for the individual who is suffering from a treatable depression, and NOT an ever-worsening dementia.

The first symptoms that people with CBD experience are problems with movement, such as stiffness and jerkiness in one or more of their limbs and a failure to control hand movement on one side (known as 'alien hand syndrome'). Many people experience symptoms of dementia, including problems with memory and thinking. A small proportion of people with frontotemporal dementia also develop CBD as an 'overlapping' condition. Other symptoms of CBD include loss of balance and co-ordination, and difficulties speaking and swallowing. Currently, there is no cure or treatment available to slow the progression of CBD, but drugs may help some symptoms and physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy may be beneficial. Early symptoms include minor lapses of memory, mood changes and loss of interest. Symptoms progress to jerky movements, shakiness, stiffness of limbs, incontinence and loss of the ability to move or speak. In a small number of patients the disease may take longer to run its course. If no immediate diagnosis is obvious, the neurologist may conclude that the person has a rare neurodegenerative disease - a type of disease that affects the nervous system and gets worse over time - and may refer them to the National Prion Clinic in London for further assessment (see 'Other useful organisations'). This is known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Difficulties with memory, thinking and reasoning (aspects of cognition) are common with HIV, but they are usually mild and dementia is much rarer. Neurocognitive disorders in people with HIV may be caused by the virus directly damaging the brain. Symptoms may include problems with short-term memory, learning, speed of thinking, difficulties with concentration and decision making, unsteadiness and mood changes. These mild impairments do not amount to dementia. This is because the symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, such as depression. Huntington's disease is an inherited disease causing abnormal movements and problems with coordination. Other symptoms include mood problems and cognitive impairment that gets progressively worse over time. Symptoms of dementia associated with Huntington's disease mainly include difficulties with concentration, planning and organisational skills. People with Huntington's disease may also develop obsessive behaviour. Some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience a loss of some of their mental abilities. This happens if damage caused by the MS occurs in certain parts of the brain. The mental abilities most likely to be affected are memory, concentration and problem solving. They may also experience emotional problems, such as mood swings and personality changes. The term 'dementia' is not generally used in association with multiple sclerosis because the decline is not usually as severe as it is in other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. It is more usual to describe the person as 'experiencing cognitive difficulties'. It is not related to frontotemporal dementia, which is also sometimes called Pick's disease. Symptoms include difficulties with walking, dementia and urinary incontinence. People with Parkinson's disease have a higher-than-average risk of developing dementia, although around two thirds of people are unaffected. Parkinson's disease dementia accounts for around 2 per cent of all cases of dementia in the UK. Symptoms of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease vary from person to person. The person's symptoms vary and can seem better or worse at different times. It is thought that Parkinson's disease dementia results from microscopic deposits known as Lewy bodies, located in nerve cells in the brain stem (the lower part of the brain just above the spinal cord). As Parkinson's disease progresses, Lewy bodies spread beyond the brain\n\nExplore the similarities and differences between two common degenerative brain disorders. Sara is forgetting things more often even though her Parkinson’s disease symptoms appear to be under good control with standard medications, healthy diet, and plenty of physical activity. Is that a part of Parkinson’s disease? And what are the differences between Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s? Parkinson’s disease (PD) was described by James Parkinson nearly 100 years before Dr. Alois Alzheimer described the dementia later named Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Called the “shaking palsy” by Parkinson, PD is diagnosed when a person shows at least two of these three symptoms: slowed movements (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, and tremor (at rest). We recognize many other associated signs of PD, including expressionless face, quiet speech, cramped handwriting, shuffling gait, trouble getting out of a chair, and difficulty swallowing. Most cases are called “idiopathic,” meaning the cause remains unknown, although a small number of cases are linked with reversible toxic medication effects (antipsychotics and some anti-vomiting medications), poisoning (certain pesticides, manganese, carbon monoxide), head trauma, or more complex PD-like neurological disorders (such as vascular parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multiple system atrophy). With a prevalence of around 3 cases per 1,000 people, PD is less common than AD but still an important cause of neurological illness among older adults. Cognitive decline is common in both AD and PD, though significantly less common in PD. The dementia of PD is called “subcortical” because of the location of affected brain areas, and subcortical dementias have somewhat different clinical symptoms than a “cortical” dementia like AD. In PD dementia, slowed physical activity can be accompanied by slowed thinking and by problems with memory that are more responsive to reminders than those of AD because the difficulty is with memory retrieval rather than, as in AD, with storage of new learning. Just like people with AD, people with PD can also develop behavioral problems. Apathy is a common development in both diseases, and so is depression. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell these syndromes apart but it’s important to try because they are managed differently. Anxiety is common to both PD and AD, and may require behavioral treatment, lowering of AD or PD medications, or addition of antidepressant or antianxiety medications—keeping in mind that both conditions leave patients vulnerable to medication side effects. In both disorders, these symptoms may indicate delirium caused by infection or other medical conditions. In PD patients, an additional risk for psychotic symptoms is added by the medications that treat movement disorder symptoms. Finally, the quality of sleep deteriorates in both AD and PD. AD patients often have fragmented sleep, while PD patients experience a different problem called REM (rapid eye movement) behavior disorder, in which physical activity occurs during the normally motionless period of REM sleep. REM behavior disorder can respond to treatment with clonazepam, a medication that would usually be avoided in AD because of concern about effects on memory and alertness. Some older adults develop movement symptoms similar to those of PD after, or only shortly before, developing cognitive difficulties that look like AD. This combination of movement and cognitive changes is characteristic of the disease considered by some to be the second most common dementia: Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). As its name suggests, LBD is a condition in which cognitive decline is very prominent, sometimes much more prominent than movement symptoms, yet the microscopic brain findings are those similar to PD. Whether LBD is truly a different condition than PD with dementia or is a variant of the same disorder remains a topic under debate, although the finding of increased beta amyloid deposits (amyloid plaques) in the brains of people with LBD has suggested a difference between these conditions. The symptoms of LBD can include dramatic fluctuations in cognitive functioning as well as falls and psychotic symptoms. Similar to patients with PD and even more than patients with AD, standard antipsychotic treatment is often complicated by severe toxic reactions. The cognitive enhancers used in AD, however, can play a useful role in treating LBD. Distinguishing between different types of neurodegenerative conditions is important: it helps in determining the best treatment approach. Sara’s further testing identified mild cognitive impairment symptoms that are probably related to her PD but exacerbated by one of the medications she has been taking. Her mental clarity improved a little with adjustment of that medication. Although PD-related cognitive changes could get worse over time, there is no sign that she is developing AD and in fact at this point there is no diagnosis of dementia.

Having a basic map of the brain and an elementary understanding about what each part is responsible for can help you to communicate with medical professionals. A caution: while this section aims to provide you with a basic “map” of the brain, be aware that the brain is an intricately complex organ. This section is intended to provide a layman’s reference and it is and intentionally drastically simplified conception of how the brain works. The outside part of the brain is called the cortex or the cerebrum. The parietal lobe is associated with touch, pain and temperature. The limbic system, referred to as the “emotional brain” is deep inside the brain and includes four structures: the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The thalamus helps control attention span and it monitors sensations the body is feeling, including pain. The hippocampus is involved in converting working memory to long term memory. Typically, STM is profoundly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike short-term memory, LTM typically remains reasonably intact for someone experiencing Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s affects working memory, so that someone experiencing Alzheimer’s disease might get “lost” in a task, needing a caregiver to support and cue them throughout the process. Alzheimer’s disease impairs semantic memory for some people, but for others it can remain relatively intact. Individuals with Alzheimer’s commonly feel anxiety, in large part because short term memory loss means that the person’s expectations and reality are not matching up. This is a term used frequently by social workers, occupational therapists, and other professionals who assess a person’s ability to maintain a good quality of life autonomously. Basic ADL’s include bathing, dressing, self-feeding, personal hygiene and grooming, toileting, and functional mobility (the ability to get in and out of a bed or chair, and to navigate safely though space). Instrumental ADL’s are more complex processes, including housework, meal preparation, taking medication, managing money, shopping, transportation, taking care of others, and using the telephone. Like dementia, cognitive loss is a descriptive term. For others, it marks the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer’s or a related dementia. A disease is called degenerative when it gets worse over time. Doctors use mental status testing to determine whether a patient has cognitive decline that indicates the presence of dementia symptoms. These are question-and-answer tests (written or oral) that assess your brain’s ability to process and retain information at the time the test was\n\nYour Elderly Client: Is She Really Suffering From Dementia? One of the most common misdiagnoses in mental health is that of dementia. This is not to say that dementia is not a real illness, or that the elderly do not suffer from it in great numbers, but it is to say that clients are not infrequently diagnosed as being demented when in fact they are really depressed. Or they may be both demented and depressed. The reason for this diagnostic confusion is that many of the symptoms of the two illnesses are similar, if not identical. But since depression is treatable (whereas most forms of dementia are not), it is critical that a careful, accurate and thorough assessment be made of the elderly client. Depression and dementia are two of the most common of all psychiatric disorders in those 65 years old and older. They’re often very difficult to tell apart, and depression is not infrequently mistakenly diagnosed as dementia. from a stroke, or a vitamin deficiency, or an endocrine disorder or from HIV or Parkinson’s Disease. Sometimes, as is the case with Alzheimer’s Dementia, the underlying cause is not known. Both the depressed and demented client are likely to show impairments in thinking and memory. The depressed person, however, is far more likely to acknowledge cognitive impairment, whereas the demented person is more likely to try to minimize any problems. Depressed people are more likely to complain about their poor memory. They are more likely to have fluctuations in their thinking abilities, and the onset of their symptoms is more sudden. However, it is very important to note that persons with dementia can also be clinically depressed. If the client is younger than 50 years old and is displaying symptoms of dementia, it’s most likely due to alcoholism or AIDS. If the client is older than 50, the incidence of dementia increases markedly, and it’s most commonly due to problems in metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, Parkinson’s Disease, alcoholism or stroke (a.k.a. The symptoms most commonly associated with depression (i.e. They are often apathetic towards life and seem emotionally “flat.” This different presentation of depression in the elderly is one key reason why the diagnosis is sometimes missed and the symptoms attributed to other causes. So how can anyone be sure what the correct diagnosis is? The only certain way is a comprehensive psychological or neuropsychological evaluation which includes psychological testing, a thorough taking of the client’s history and gathering of collateral information from others who know the client well. The consequences of not conducting an exhaustive evaluation can be dire indeed, and could result in an unnecessary loss of autonomy for the individual who is suffering from a treatable depression, and NOT an ever-worsening dementia.

In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy. Clinical psychology is distinguished from psychiatry. Although practitioners in both fields are mental health professionals, clinical psychologists treat mental disorders primarily through psychotherapy and have a doctorate in Psychology or a Doctor of Psychology degree. Currently, five U.S. states, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho, allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat mental disorders primarily through medication and have a medical degree. History The earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical, and/or medical perspectives. While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his \"talking cure\" in Vienna, that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \"pure\" science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867–1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities. Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, The Psychological Clinic, where he coined the term \"clinical psychology\", defined as \"the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change\". Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. World War II and the integration of treatment When World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the Boulder Model, for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology. Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health Service with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society. Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many, the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or Vail Model—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade.

Many allied health professional boards and professionals are following these events with keen interest, wondering where decision-makers will rest on these pivotal issues for psychology, counseling, social work, behavior analysis, speech pathology, physical therapy, etc. Ethical standards and guidelines issued by leading mental health professional associations regarding telepractice typically do not take a stand for or against a requirement for in-person intakes or assessments. The fascinating twist on the issue however, is that most telemedicine does not occur directly between a physician as an independent practitioner and a patient. Whether a nurse who takes vital signs, or a medic who serves in the military, or a “collaborator” who is a para-professional located whereever the patient is in geographic space, an accountable, trained third party is available to outline and present relevant issues for intake and assessment. It therefore is the move away from such a third party that raises concerns for medical as well as behavioral professionals. When providing telepsychology services, considering client/patient preferences for such services is important. Psychologists are encouraged to carefully examine the unique benefits of delivering telepsychology services (e.g., access to care, access to consulting services, client convenience, accommodating client special needs, etc.) Moreover, psychologists are aware of such other factors as geographic location, organizational culture, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), and, as appropriate, medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the telepsychology services being offered. Furthermore, psychologists are encouraged to communicate any risks and benefits of the telepsychology services to be offered to the client/patient and document such communication. In addition, psychologists may consider some initial in-person contact with the client/patient to facilitate an active discussion on these issues and/or conduct the initial assessment. The APA statement above gives a clear warning, but apparently leaves the decision about in-person intake and assessment to the clinician. What do you think of the need for in-person assessments for telemental health? The problem with the prior allowances by the Texas Medical Board is that it was insufficient compared to the Ryan Haight Act – a federal law passed in 2008 that requires physicians to preform an in-person assessment prior to prescribing medications. Physicians are exempt from the Act, though, if they meet the federal definition of practicing telemedicine (in brief, patient is located in a medical facility that has a DEA registration). If teledoc was allowing their physicians to write scripts without first seeing them, and the patients were not seen in a site that was exempt from the act, those physicians would thereby in violation of federal law. As far as psychologists and other mental health therapists go, I would not mind a state or federal law requiring an in-person assessment first, as that is how I currently practice now, but don’t know if it’s necessary. This is not something psychologists generally involve themselves in, though some psychologists are noticing that blood pressuring monitoring, etc are part of the Physician Quality Reporting System for psychologists who see Medicaid participants. There has to be someone on the other end, though, to assist, but these devices will likely lead to less need for an in-person assessment. Not everyone is appropriate for telemedicine and conducting such a session prior to such an evaluation is clinically inappropriate (my professional opinion). I can think of many, maybe the majority, of clinical issues that might arise and could be appropriately and effectively addressed beginning with a tele-assessment as well as other situations where tele-assessment in the absence of any other support could be a very risky decision. What I see as a possible long term negative affect is that telehealth will become the norm and it will become too expensive to see a doctor live. I also believe in my counseling practice that people can easily scam you from a distance and it’s much harder in person. If the level is within the therapeutic range, the client is most likely compliant with medication therapy. In this situation, the nurse can be charged with battery because the nurse administers a medication that the client has refused. Generally there are only two instances in which the informed consent of an adult client is not needed. One instance is when an emergency is present and delaying treatment for the purpose of obtaining informed consent would result in injury or death to the client. External disasters occur in the community, and many victims may be brought to the emergency room for care. If a nurse feels that an assignment is more difficult than the assignment delegated to other nurses on the unit, the nurse would most appropriately discuss the assignment with the nurse manager of the neurological unit. A nurse would not refuse an assignment. Specific situations may be present in which a nurse should not take care of a specific client, for example, if a pregnant nurse is assigned to care for a client with rubella or a client with an internal radiation implant. The nurse would not return to the cardiac unit; this would be client abandonment, and this action does not address the conflict directly. This stops the burning process and helps to alleviate\n\nClinical psychology is an integration of science, theory, and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.

Many allied health professional boards and professionals are following these events with keen interest, wondering where decision-makers will rest on these pivotal issues for psychology, counseling, social work, behavior analysis, speech pathology, physical therapy, etc. Ethical standards and guidelines issued by leading mental health professional associations regarding telepractice typically do not take a stand for or against a requirement for in-person intakes or assessments. The fascinating twist on the issue however, is that most telemedicine does not occur directly between a physician as an independent practitioner and a patient. Whether a nurse who takes vital signs, or a medic who serves in the military, or a “collaborator” who is a para-professional located whereever the patient is in geographic space, an accountable, trained third party is available to outline and present relevant issues for intake and assessment. It therefore is the move away from such a third party that raises concerns for medical as well as behavioral professionals. When providing telepsychology services, considering client/patient preferences for such services is important. Psychologists are encouraged to carefully examine the unique benefits of delivering telepsychology services (e.g., access to care, access to consulting services, client convenience, accommodating client special needs, etc.) Moreover, psychologists are aware of such other factors as geographic location, organizational culture, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), and, as appropriate, medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the telepsychology services being offered. Furthermore, psychologists are encouraged to communicate any risks and benefits of the telepsychology services to be offered to the client/patient and document such communication. In addition, psychologists may consider some initial in-person contact with the client/patient to facilitate an active discussion on these issues and/or conduct the initial assessment. The APA statement above gives a clear warning, but apparently leaves the decision about in-person intake and assessment to the clinician. What do you think of the need for in-person assessments for telemental health? The problem with the prior allowances by the Texas Medical Board is that it was insufficient compared to the Ryan Haight Act – a federal law passed in 2008 that requires physicians to preform an in-person assessment prior to prescribing medications. Physicians are exempt from the Act, though, if they meet the federal definition of practicing telemedicine (in brief, patient is located in a medical facility that has a DEA registration). If teledoc was allowing their physicians to write scripts without first seeing them, and the patients were not seen in a site that was exempt from the act, those physicians would thereby in violation of federal law. As far as psychologists and other mental health therapists go, I would not mind a state or federal law requiring an in-person assessment first, as that is how I currently practice now, but don’t know if it’s necessary. This is not something psychologists generally involve themselves in, though some psychologists are noticing that blood pressuring monitoring, etc are part of the Physician Quality Reporting System for psychologists who see Medicaid participants. There has to be someone on the other end, though, to assist, but these devices will likely lead to less need for an in-person assessment. Not everyone is appropriate for telemedicine and conducting such a session prior to such an evaluation is clinically inappropriate (my professional opinion). I can think of many, maybe the majority, of clinical issues that might arise and could be appropriately and effectively addressed beginning with a tele-assessment as well as other situations where tele-assessment in the absence of any other support could be a very risky decision. What I see as a possible long term negative affect is that telehealth will become the norm and it will become too expensive to see a doctor live. I also believe in my counseling practice that people can easily scam you from a distance and it’s much harder in person. If the level is within the therapeutic range, the client is most likely compliant with medication therapy. In this situation, the nurse can be charged with battery because the nurse administers a medication that the client has refused. Generally there are only two instances in which the informed consent of an adult client is not needed. One instance is when an emergency is present and delaying treatment for the purpose of obtaining informed consent would result in injury or death to the client. External disasters occur in the community, and many victims may be brought to the emergency room for care. If a nurse feels that an assignment is more difficult than the assignment delegated to other nurses on the unit, the nurse would most appropriately discuss the assignment with the nurse manager of the neurological unit. A nurse would not refuse an assignment. Specific situations may be present in which a nurse should not take care of a specific client, for example, if a pregnant nurse is assigned to care for a client with rubella or a client with an internal radiation implant. The nurse would not return to the cardiac unit; this would be client abandonment, and this action does not address the conflict directly. This stops the burning process and helps to alleviate\n\nClinical psychology is an integration of science, theory, and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development.

Psychodynamic therapy explores an individual's unconscious, seeking reasons or explanations for the individual's current behavior. This therapy, also called insight-oriented therapy, attempts to bring underlying factors grounded in early life to the individual's attention, increasing self-awareness and self-understanding. Psychodynamic therapy stems from Sigmund Freud's focus on psychoanalysis, making it the oldest form of psychotherapy. Because the results of psychoanalysis research are harder to measure than behavioral-oriented therapies, research methodologies and outcomes of treatment have been questioned - especially those of the earliest studies. However, researchers today apply the most rigorous scientific processes, including meta-analysis studies completed over a number of years, to study of efficacy of psychodynamic practice and techniques, and many studies report significant positive outcomes. In 2008, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) used a meta-analysis process to examine studies published between January 1, 1960, and May 31, 2008, identifying the possible effects of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. Treating schizophrenia with psychodynamic therapies. Psychodynamic psychology and human development. Humanistic therapy, founded by psychologist Carl Rogers, grew out of a reaction to psychoanalysis and behaviorism, two schools of thought that Rogers considered too \"pessimistic.\" Through psychoanalysis, Freud dwelled on unconscious motivators for behavior, while behaviorism, which followed developments in psychoanalysis, attributed behaviors to learned conditioning processes. Rogers emphasized human potential, inherent goodness, the ability to self-direct by making choices; his form of psychotherapy came to be known as client-centered therapy. According to the Association of Humanistic Psychology (AHP), humanistic psychology today emphasizes \"the independent dignity and worth of human beings and their conscious capacity to develop personal competence and self respect. This value orientation has led to the development of therapies to facilitate personal and interpersonal skills, and to enhance the quality of life.\" Therefore, many humanistic psychologists also stress the importance of social change, modifying institutions and organizations to support human development, and acknowledging and building connectedness throughout a globally interdependent world. Research, therefore, in humanistic psychology focuses not only on finding appropriate interventions toward helping individuals find their purpose and meaning in life, but also on peace and social justice issues within communities, nations, and the world. The connection between people, the environment and spirituality. Creative, empathetic, and critical thinking with self-reflection. As the name implies, this therapy addresses both cognition - thoughts, feelings, emotions - and behaviors, attempting to change dysfunctional ways of thinking or misguided thought patterns that often lead to dysfunctional and sometimes harmful behaviors. The therapy focuses on the present, current thought patterns, identifying distortions, and applying interventions that specifically target those errant thoughts. Typically, this type of therapy is short-term and goal-oriented, with occasional \"checkups\" to gauge progress and help in correcting any missteps. an approach to therapy is supported by research findings, and those findings provide evidence that it is effective. Family systems therapy is psychotherapy that treats families, couples, and close-knit groups of people or extended families, as a system. This means that the psychologist treats the family, couple, or group as a unit, which scientists believe function as one organism or system, operating with a distinct set of communication and interaction patterns, and internal rules - all directly affecting behaviors. Rather than focus on the dysfunction or problems of one individual, the entire system receives therapy. Over the past 20 years, this form of psychotherapy that began with a focus on the traditional family unit has expanded to include therapy for all types of familial relationships, including gay and lesbian couples and families, extended families related through divorce and re-marriage, and other groups that resemble family systems, such as church or religious groups. For this reason, researchers of family systems theory and therapy have experienced an exponential growth in the number of topics and issues for study and investigation. Is family therapy or individual therapy most effective for treating adolescent anorexia nervosa? What is the impact of eating disorders on families? How do family dynamics affect individuals with eating disorders? How does the mother-infant relationship affect future eating disorders? What are effective family therapies for childhood behavioral disorders? Immigration and family emotional process. Does a couple-based approach work to reduce the effects of post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)? What are the most effective interventions for aiding better communication between couples? How does family structure and functioning affect drug abusers? What is the importance of parent-child relationships on preventing drug use and abuse? Multimedia interventions for families where one or more members\n\nGrowing up in a family with dysfunctional boundaries can have several long-term effects on an individual's health and well-being. Dysfunction in the family of origin has been found to be associated with a higher risk of various health issues and even untimely death from conditions like cancer, heart disease, injury, or other causes. Therefore, in order to promote healing and well-being, it becomes crucial to establish or reclaim the boundaries of an autonomous self. Boundaries and autonomy are essential for maintaining good health. It is important to note that individuals who grow up in families with dysfunctional boundaries may face challenges in developing healthy relationship patterns, setting personal boundaries, and maintaining a strong sense of self. The research of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts Lyman Wynne and Theodore Lidz on communication deviance and roles (e.g., pseudo-mutuality, pseudo-hostility, schism and skew) in families of people with schizophrenia also became influential with systems-communications-oriented theorists and therapists. A related theme, applying to dysfunction and psychopathology more generally, was that of the \"identified patient\" or \"presenting problem\" as a manifestation of or surrogate for the family's, or even society's, problems. By the mid-1960s, a number \n\n distinct schools of family therapy had emerged. From those groups that were most strongly influenced by cybernetics and systems theory, there came MRI Brief Therapy, and slightly later, strategic therapy, Salvador Minuchin's Structural Family Therapy and the Milan systems model. Partly in reaction to some aspects of these systemic models, came the experiential approaches of Virginia Satir and Carl Whitaker, which downplayed theoretical constructs, and emphasized subjective experience and unexpressed feelings (including the subconscious), authentic communication, spontaneity, creativity, total therapist engagement, and often included the extended family. Concurrently and somewhat independently, there emerged the various intergenerational therapies of Murray Bowen, \n\nDysfunction within a family can manifest in various ways and can have significant impacts on the overall well-being of its members.

Rogers emphasized human potential, inherent goodness, the ability to self-direct by making choices; his form of psychotherapy came to be known as client-centered therapy. According to the Association of Humanistic Psychology (AHP), humanistic psychology today emphasizes \"the independent dignity and worth of human beings and their conscious capacity to develop personal competence and self respect. This value orientation has led to the development of therapies to facilitate personal and interpersonal skills, and to enhance the quality of life.\" Therefore, many humanistic psychologists also stress the importance of social change, modifying institutions and organizations to support human development, and acknowledging and building connectedness throughout a globally interdependent world. Research, therefore, in humanistic psychology focuses not only on finding appropriate interventions toward helping individuals find their purpose and meaning in life, but also on peace and social justice issues within communities, nations, and the world. The connection between people, the environment and spirituality. Creative, empathetic, and critical thinking with self-reflection. As the name implies, this therapy addresses both cognition - thoughts, feelings, emotions - and behaviors, attempting to change dysfunctional ways of thinking or misguided thought patterns that often lead to dysfunctional and sometimes harmful behaviors. The therapy focuses on the present, current thought patterns, identifying distortions, and applying interventions that specifically target those errant thoughts. Typically, this type of therapy is short-term and goal-oriented, with occasional \"checkups\" to gauge progress and help in correcting any missteps. an approach to therapy is supported by research findings, and those findings provide evidence that it is effective. Family systems therapy is psychotherapy that treats families, couples, and close-knit groups of people or extended families, as a system. This means that the psychologist treats the family, couple, or group as a unit, which scientists believe function as one organism or system, operating with a distinct set of communication and interaction patterns, and internal rules - all directly affecting behaviors. Rather than focus on the dysfunction or problems of one individual, the entire system receives therapy. Over the past 20 years, this form of psychotherapy that began with a focus on the traditional family unit has expanded to include therapy for all types of familial relationships, including gay and lesbian couples and families, extended families related through divorce and re-marriage, and other groups that resemble family systems, such as church or religious groups. For this reason, researchers of family systems theory and therapy have experienced an exponential growth in the number of topics and issues for study and investigation. Is family therapy or individual therapy most effective for treating adolescent anorexia nervosa? What is the impact of eating disorders on families? How do family dynamics affect individuals with eating disorders? How does the mother-infant relationship affect future eating disorders? What are effective family therapies for childhood behavioral disorders? Immigration and family emotional process. Does a couple-based approach work to reduce the effects of post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)? What are the most effective interventions for aiding better communication between couples? How does family structure and functioning affect drug abusers? What is the importance of parent-child relationships on preventing drug use and abuse? Multimedia interventions for families where one or more members\n\nGrowing up in a family with dysfunctional boundaries can have several long-term effects on an individual's health and well-being. Dysfunction in the family of origin has been found to be associated with a higher risk of various health issues and even untimely death from conditions like cancer, heart disease, injury, or other causes. Therefore, in order to promote healing and well-being, it becomes crucial to establish or reclaim the boundaries of an autonomous self. Boundaries and autonomy are essential for maintaining good health. It is important to note that individuals who grow up in families with dysfunctional boundaries may face challenges in developing healthy relationship patterns, setting personal boundaries, and maintaining a strong sense of self. The research of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts Lyman Wynne and Theodore Lidz on communication deviance and roles (e.g., pseudo-mutuality, pseudo-hostility, schism and skew) in families of people with schizophrenia also became influential with systems-communications-oriented theorists and therapists. A related theme, applying to dysfunction and psychopathology more generally, was that of the \"identified patient\" or \"presenting problem\" as a manifestation of or surrogate for the family's, or even society's, problems. By the mid-1960s, a number \n\n distinct schools of family therapy had emerged. From those groups that were most strongly influenced by cybernetics and systems theory, there came MRI Brief Therapy, and slightly later, strategic therapy, Salvador Minuchin's Structural Family Therapy and the Milan systems model. Partly in reaction to some aspects of these systemic models, came the experiential approaches of Virginia Satir and Carl Whitaker, which downplayed theoretical constructs, and emphasized subjective experience and unexpressed feelings (including the subconscious), authentic communication, spontaneity, creativity, total therapist engagement, and often included the extended family. Concurrently and somewhat independently, there emerged the various intergenerational therapies of Murray Bowen, \n\nDysfunction within a family can manifest in various ways and can have significant impacts on the overall well-being of its members. Some examples of dysfunction that can occur within a family include:\n\n1. It is important to note that every family dynamic is unique and complex; dysfunction may vary greatly from one situation to another. Seeking professional help, such as family therapy or counseling, can be beneficial in addressing and resolving these issues.\n\n"

Collaborations have been established between clinical lab services, the provincial health service provider and researchers to create an interdisciplinary study design for the All Our Babies Study. Women provide informed consent for blood sample collection, linkage to medical records and complete questionnaires related to prenatal health, service utilization, social support, emotional and physical health, demographics, and breast and infant feeding. Establishing these partnerships during the study design phase and maintaining these relationships through the duration of the study provides the unique opportunity to investigate the multi-causal factors of preterm birth. Moreover, the rate of preterm birth, that is birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation, has been on the rise for the past 3 decades in many developed countries including Canada, the USA and European nations where current rates range between 5-12% . Infants born preterm are at increased risks for neonatal complications and associated long-term morbidity such as developmental delays, hearing and vision impairments, respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral palsy and retinopathy of prematurity, prolonging the financial, emotional and stress-related costs of prematurity well beyond the care received within neonatal intensive care units. The risk for adverse neonatal outcomes is inversely related to gestational age at birth with the highest morbidity among those infants delivered prior to 28 completed weeks of pregnancy (early preterm) despite technological advances and improved medical treatments having greatly increased the survival of these infants [6, 7]. Recent studies have shown that these late preterm infants are at higher risk for adverse acute and long-term outcomes when compared to term infants . Preterm birth is often categorized as (1) iatrogenic when delivery is a consequence of medical intervention (30-35%); (2) spontaneous when it occurs after spontaneous labour with intact membranes (40-45%); or (3) the result of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) (25-30%) . While gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction have all been associated with iatrogenic preterm birth, the underlying causes of spontaneous preterm birth are less clear. Reported risk factors are widespread and diverse, supporting the hypothesis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the pathophysiology of spontaneous preterm birth. Highly associated risk factors include a previous preterm birth or a relative with preterm birth or a black racial background , suggesting genetic causes.

The National Child Development Study began in 1958 and has followed a cohort of individuals born in England, Scotland, and Wales. This study collects data on various aspects of their lives, including health, education, employment, and social factors. The study has continued for over 60 years and has provided valuable insights into the long-term effects of various factors on health and well-being. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children started in 1991-1992 with around 14,000 pregnant women from Bristol. This study aims to investigate how genetic, environmental, social, and economic factors influence health and development. The study follows both parents and children to understand how early life experiences impact later outcomes. This study focuses on exploring various aspects such as child development, health inequalities, education outcomes, family dynamics, socio-economic factors affecting families' lives over time. Data is collected through surveys completed by parents or caregivers at regular intervals. Reference:\n- Birth cohort studies in Britain include four long-term medical and social studies carried out over the lives of a group of participants from birth. Alcohol can be a depressant which slows down some regions of the brain, like the prefrontal and temporal cortex, negatively affecting rationality and memory. The connection between the amount of alcohol intake, level of depressed mood, and how it affects the risks of experiencing consequences from alcoholism, were studied in a research done on college students. The study used 4 latent, distinct profiles of different alcohol intake and level of depression; Mild or Moderate Depression, and Heavy or Severe Drinkers. Results showed that the level of depression as an emotion negatively affected the amount of risky behavior and consequence from drinking, while having an inverse relationship with protective behavioral strategies, which are behavioral actions taken by oneself for protection from the relative harm of alcohol intake. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking. Those who oppose a complete ban on underage drinking argue that it is important that minors be introduced to alcohol in a controlled environment, so that supervision and guidance might occur instead of experimentation.

Comprehension: The assessment should determine if the patient's comprehension is spared or impaired. Repetition: The ability to repeat words or phrases should be evaluated. Naming: The patient's ability to name objects or pictures should be assessed. Reading: Look for evidence of alexia, which is the impairment of reading ability. Can the patient read written words or sentences? By analyzing these features through listening to the patient's spontaneous speech, asking questions or giving commands, and conducting specific tasks such as repetition, naming, reading, and writing tests, different types of aphasia can be defined. For example, motor (\"expressive\") aphasias are characterized by non-fluent verbal output with intact or largely unimpaired comprehension. On the other hand, sensory (\"receptive\") aphasias demonstrate fluent verbal output, often with paraphasias and impaired comprehension. Conduction aphasia is marked by relatively normal spontaneous speech but a profound deficit of repetition. Transcortical motor aphasia is characterized by impaired spontaneous output but intact repetition. Clinical assessment and proper diagnosis of aphasia require thorough evaluation of these key features. If the patient exhibits sparse, laborious, nonfluent speech, it may suggest Broca aphasia, which can be further explored through tests involving repetition from dictation and praxis of the oropharyngeal muscles. On the other hand, fluent but empty paraphasic speech with impaired comprehension may indicate Wernicke aphasia. Lastly, testing the patient's ability to repeat spoken language is a crucial maneuver in evaluating aphasic disorders, as defective repetition can present in all major forms of aphasia. Similar errors appear even more frequently when the patient is asked to explain the text, read aloud, or give an explanation in writing. The bedside analysis of aphasic disorders that we find most useful entails the systematic testing of six aspects of language function: conversational speech, comprehension, repetition, reading, writing, and naming. Aphasia is not caused by damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces abnormal speech; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of speech but rather the individual's language cognition (although a person can have both problems, particularly if they suffered a hemorrhage that damaged a large area of the brain).

Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The most commonly treated Disruptive Behavior Disorders may be classified as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or Conduct Disorder (CD), depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The disorders often co-occur with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It uses a unique combination of behavioral therapy, play therapy, and parent training to teach more effective discipline techniques and improve the parent–child relationship. History PCIT was derived from several theories, including attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. Attachment theory According to attachment theory by Ainsworth, “sensitive and responsive parenting” during infancy and toddlerhood leads the child to develop an expectation that their needs can be met by the parent. Thus, parents who show their young children greater warmth and are more responsive and sensitive to their needs promote a sense of security that they can later apply to relationships with others. Children who are referred to clinics for externalizing behaviors are more likely than non-referred children to display distress when separated from the parent and to display indicators of an insecure attachment to their parent. This is a critical period where children are more responsive to their parent's and less so to other influences such as teachers or peers. Patterson (1975) further expands on this and proposes that child behavior problems are “inadvertently established or maintained by dysfunctional parent-child interactions”. There can be a “coercive interaction cycle” between parent and child where both try to control the behavior of the other. Behaviors such as arguing and aggression in children are reinforced by parent behaviors (e.g., withdrawal of demands), but negative parent behaviors can subsequently be reinforced by negative child behaviors. In sum, children can learn many behaviors from their parents’ feedback, but this can result in negative externalizing behaviors, as well. The PDI component targets this cycle specifically by establishing consistent parenting behaviors that encourage the desired behavior in children. Parenting style theory According to Diana Baumrind’s parenting style theory (year link citation) found that the authoritative parenting style leads to the healthiest outcomes for children transitioning into adolescence. This style combines responsive and nurturing interactions with clear communication and firm discipline. The influence of this theory can be seen particularly in the PDI treatment phase where parents are taught to use direct commands to increase desired behavior, along with other positive and nurturing behaviors. After this training session, the sessions that follow will include the child. Meanwhile, the therapist and the other parent will be observing the play through a one-way mirror or video system. Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) According to Eyberg (1988), the parent's goal during this stage is to follow the child's lead during play while being sure to follow the “Don’t Rules” and “Do Rules of CDI”. Don’t rules of CDI According to Eyberg (1988), the Don’t rules help parents step back and encourage child-led play by avoiding commands, questions, and criticisms. The general idea is that questions provide little information, so they have limited usefulness in therapy. As children learn which behaviors are good or bad, they rely on what their parents say about them and believe it. Taken together, criticisms are not only unproductive in therapy, but also are threats to the positive relationship that the PCIT emphasizes. Doing this may seem unnatural at first, but describing serves a few purposes: it allows the child to (1) lead play, (2) improve attention towards independent activities, (3) clarify the activity and encourage the child to further elaborate the play, and (4) help teach the child different concepts in a positive way. Eyberg recommends that the parents “sit close and do the same thing as the child”.

Parenting style theory According to Diana Baumrind’s parenting style theory (year link citation) found that the authoritative parenting style leads to the healthiest outcomes for children transitioning into adolescence. This style combines responsive and nurturing interactions with clear communication and firm discipline. The influence of this theory can be seen particularly in the PDI treatment phase where parents are taught to use direct commands to increase desired behavior, along with other positive and nurturing behaviors. After this training session, the sessions that follow will include the child. Meanwhile, the therapist and the other parent will be observing the play through a one-way mirror or video system. Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) According to Eyberg (1988), the parent's goal during this stage is to follow the child's lead during play while being sure to follow the “Don’t Rules” and “Do Rules of CDI”. Don’t rules of CDI According to Eyberg (1988), the Don’t rules help parents step back and encourage child-led play by avoiding commands, questions, and criticisms. The general idea is that questions provide little information, so they have limited usefulness in therapy. As children learn which behaviors are good or bad, they rely on what their parents say about them and believe it. Taken together, criticisms are not only unproductive in therapy, but also are threats to the positive relationship that the PCIT emphasizes. Doing this may seem unnatural at first, but describing serves a few purposes: it allows the child to (1) lead play, (2) improve attention towards independent activities, (3) clarify the activity and encourage the child to further elaborate the play, and (4) help teach the child different concepts in a positive way. Eyberg recommends that the parents “sit close and do the same thing as the child”. The manual specifies two types\n\n other form of corporal punishment) is associated with the opposite effect. When adults physically punish children, the children tend to obey parents less with time and develop more aggressive behaviors, including toward other children. This increase in aggressive behavior appears to reflect the child's perception that hitting is the way to deal with anger and frustration. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), and the \n\n of preschoolers, for example, take a more passive co-regulating role. Instead of more actively co-regulating, these parents are more likely than parents of younger children to give their children space to independently regulate, suggest regulation strategies, or facilitate more abstract discussions regarding emotional experiences and appropriate responses. The strongest theoretical and empirical support for this phenomenon comes from research on attachment theory. The basic premise is that early biological and behavioral co-regulation from the caregiver facilitates the child's development of secure attachment which then promotes self-regulation. Drawing from \n\nParent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an intervention developed by Sheila Eyberg (1988) to treat children between ages 2 and 7 with disruptive behavior problems. Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The most commonly treated Disruptive Behavior Disorders may be classified as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or Conduct Disorder (CD), depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The disorders often co-occur with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It uses a unique combination of behavioral therapy, play therapy, and parent training to teach more effective discipline techniques and improve the parent–child relationship. History PCIT was derived from several theories, including attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. Attachment theory According to attachment theory by Ainsworth, “sensitive and responsive parenting” during infancy and toddlerhood leads the child to develop an expectation that their needs can be met by the parent. Thus, parents who show their young children greater warmth and are more responsive and sensitive to their needs promote a sense of security that they can later apply to relationships with others. Children who are referred to clinics for externalizing behaviors are more likely than non-referred children to display distress when separated from the parent and to display indicators of an insecure attachment to their parent. The Child Directed Interaction (CDI) component of the PCIT applies attachment theory through its goal to “restructure the parent-child relationship and provide a secure attachment for the child”. This is a critical period where children are more responsive to their parent's and less so to other influences such as teachers or peers. Patterson (1975) further expands on this and proposes that child behavior problems are “inadvertently established or maintained by dysfunctional parent-child interactions”. There can be a “coercive interaction cycle” between parent and child where both try to control the behavior of the other. Behaviors such as arguing and aggression in children are reinforced by parent behaviors (e.g., withdrawal of demands), but negative parent behaviors can subsequently be reinforced by negative child behaviors. In sum, children can learn many behaviors from their parents’ feedback, but this can result in negative externalizing behaviors, as well. The PDI component targets this cycle specifically by establishing consistent parenting behaviors that encourage the desired behavior in children.

Multidisciplinary collaboration: Collaboration between professionals from different disciplines, such as pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, and legal professionals, is recommended to provide comprehensive support for child witnesses. Some of the services offered by psychologists include therapy, clinical assessment, teaching and training, expert witness services, and consultancy. Psychologists can also conduct structured clinical assessments to evaluate cognitive functioning, personality, or psychosis. Furthermore, psychologists may provide specialist teaching and training services, sharing their expertise and knowledge with other professionals or individuals interested in learning about psychology. Overall, psychologists aim to support individuals in their wellness and recovery journey, helping them develop their own Wellness and Recovery Action Plan to maintain their wellbeing and continue progress made in therapy. Please note that the specific services offered by psychologists may vary based on their expertise and practice. It is recommended to contact a psychologist directly to inquire about their specific services and areas of focus. In addition, psychologists need to be able to arrive at scientifically-informed conclusions in their evaluations that will withstand the rigors of scrutiny by psychologists on the opposing side and of cross-examination in court. In terms of their education and training, psychologists need to be able to address the full array of areas under discussion, especially in forensic, rehabilitation, and trauma areas. They must become experts in assessment and testing, especially regarding (a) personality tests (e.g., the MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989; Butcher, Graham, Ben-Porath, Tellegen, Dahlstrom, & Kaemmer, 2001; and the revision the MMPI-2 RF; \n\nThe forensic mental health role may involve directly providing or overseeing the provision of therapeutic services, such as a psychiatrist conducting pharmacotherapy or a psychologist, social worker, or counselor doing group or one-to-one psychotherapy for a legally detained, incarcerated, or paroled youth or adult.Or testimony might involve assessing a person involved in a legal case and testifying about the results (such as assessing the trauma history and PTSD symptoms of a defendant charged with a crime or a plaintiff seeking damages from an accidental injury or assault). As an expert witness, the traumatic stress professional may be called upon to estimate the likelihood that PTSD was a cause of an individual's behavior or compromised his or her ability to competently make decisions and act responsibly either at the time of an injurious act or crime or during a trial. The attorneys who represent the parties involved in a lawsuit or a defendant in a criminal trial or the judge may question the expert witness to make judgments of the extent to which harm sustained by a plaintiff or the victim of a crime includes PTSD as a result of the alleged incidents constituting a traumatic stressor that constitutes a psychological injury. The expert witness could also be asked to provide recommendations for services (such as mental health treatment generally or PTSD therapy specifically) or resources (such as foster or adoptive placement for a maltreated child or paid time off work for an injured employee) that will be needed in order to enable the person to recover from harm or to be able to competently stand trial or successfully complete incarceration and safely return to the community. The clinical role for traumatic stress professionals in forensic settings also may include conducting pretrial or follow-up mental health assessments that are used by the judge to assist in decisions without having the professional actually testify in court.

Multidisciplinary collaboration: Collaboration between professionals from different disciplines, such as pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, and legal professionals, is recommended to provide comprehensive support for child witnesses. Some of the services offered by psychologists include therapy, clinical assessment, teaching and training, expert witness services, and consultancy. Psychologists can also conduct structured clinical assessments to evaluate cognitive functioning, personality, or psychosis. Furthermore, psychologists may provide specialist teaching and training services, sharing their expertise and knowledge with other professionals or individuals interested in learning about psychology. Overall, psychologists aim to support individuals in their wellness and recovery journey, helping them develop their own Wellness and Recovery Action Plan to maintain their wellbeing and continue progress made in therapy. Please note that the specific services offered by psychologists may vary based on their expertise and practice. It is recommended to contact a psychologist directly to inquire about their specific services and areas of focus. In addition, psychologists need to be able to arrive at scientifically-informed conclusions in their evaluations that will withstand the rigors of scrutiny by psychologists on the opposing side and of cross-examination in court. In terms of their education and training, psychologists need to be able to address the full array of areas under discussion, especially in forensic, rehabilitation, and trauma areas. They must become experts in assessment and testing, especially regarding (a) personality tests (e.g., the MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989; Butcher, Graham, Ben-Porath, Tellegen, Dahlstrom, & Kaemmer, 2001; and the revision the MMPI-2 RF; \n\nThe forensic mental health role may involve directly providing or overseeing the provision of therapeutic services, such as a psychiatrist conducting pharmacotherapy or a psychologist, social worker, or counselor doing group or one-to-one psychotherapy for a legally detained, incarcerated, or paroled youth or adult.Or testimony might involve assessing a person involved in a legal case and testifying about the results (such as assessing the trauma history and PTSD symptoms of a defendant charged with a crime or a plaintiff seeking damages from an accidental injury or assault).

We found that the model could fit a range of normolipidemic and dyslipidemic subjects from fifteen out of sixteen studies equally well, with an average 8.8% ± 5.0% fit error; only one study showed a larger fit error. The VLDL metabolic ratios outperformed each of the classical diagnostics separately; they also added power of distinction when included in a multivariate logistic regression model on top of the classical diagnostics. Although such a profile contains much information, it has not led to a single diagnostic value that is easily applicable. One example of interpreting this detailed data is the pooling of all LDL particles, and reporting an 'LDL particle number'. Data use and generation in current and future model implementations. The light blue area illustrates the final application we aim at. Model development and calibration are necessary to overcome previously identified shortcomings (see model development below). It is impossible to measure these quantities directly. Instead, a feasible approach to technical validation is to calibrate the model with pooled lipoprotein flux data from genetically deficient subjects, and subsequently corroborate it with pooled lipoprotein flux data from a range of different normolipidemic and dyslipidemic subjects. In this study we address two questions. Second, whether Particle Profiler- based ratios of VLDL metabolic processes derived from pooled lipoprotein flux data indicate relevant differences between dyslipidemic and normolipidemic subjects. Continuing on from the second question, we also examined the effect of statin and fibrate treatment on the VLDL metabolic ratios. The model includes VLDL, IDL and LDL particles. The mathematical functions describing liver uptake and lipolysis needed further development for two reasons. The deviation was mainly due to the uptake fluxes, suggesting that the mathematical functions used to model uptake processes were suboptimal. Secondly, a parameter identifiability analysis, using the covariance matrix produced by the parameter fitting routine (data not shown), showed that detailed lipoprotein profiles, in contrast to lipoprotein kinetics data, do not contain enough information to fit the six parameters in the original model. We expect that this necessary simplification wil reduce model performance, but by smart reduction and subsequent calibration we attempt to limit the performance reduction. Design Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Cochrane register of controlled trials, Cochrane Wounds Group specialised trials register, Medline (1950-2007), Embase, and CINAHL bibliographic databases, without language restrictions. Data extraction Primary outcomes were time (days) to healing, surgical site infection, and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and assessed for quality. Meta-analyses used fixed and random effects models, dichotomous data were reported as relative risks or Peto odds ratios and continuous data are given as mean differences; all with 95% confidence intervals. Benefits were clearly shown with off-midline closure compared with midline closure. Variations in current practice reflect the literature, which describes a wide spectrum in patient outcomes for different open and closed surgical techniques. Bibliographies of included studies were reviewed to identify potentially relevant articles. To inquire about unpublished data we contacted authors of included studies. We made no distinction between presentation of recurrent or de novo disease. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. Two reviewers (IJDMcC and JB) independently assessed study quality according to the Cochrane Handbook.3 Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (PMK). We did not assess blinding after allocation as it was not possible to blind patients, surgeons, or assessors to the intervention. We assessed several criteria: randomisation—whether the sequence was truly random (for example, computer generated, random number tables, coin toss); concealment of allocation—whether a randomisation method described would not allow the investigator or participant to know or influence the intervention group before an eligible participant was entered (allocation concealed); and completeness of follow-up—whether withdrawals were described and reported by treatment group (completeness of follow-up recorded; >80% cut-off). We categorised risk of bias as low (all criteria met), moderate (one or more criteria met), or high (no criteria met). We defined interventions as closed if primary closure of the skin edges was achieved. If this closure lay in the midline of the natal cleft we allocated the intervention to the midline closure subgroup. We analysed quantitative data using RevMan. For each outcome we calculated summary estimates of treatment effect (95% confidence intervals) for each comparison. We calculated mean differences for continuous data, and relative risk or Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Peto odds ratio when event rates were low. We did not do a sensitivity analysis because of the small numbers of included trials. We assessed clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity was tested using the χ2 test and the I2 statistic.3 Fixed effects models were used unless we found significant evidence of statistical heterogeneity or clinical diversity. When diversity or result format precluded meta-analysis, we present the results in a tabular format. Sample sizes in the trials ranged from 33 to 200 participants (total 1573; table 1⇓). Only two studies adequately fulfilled all methodological requirements and were considered as having low risk of bias.w14 w17 Four studies were considered to be at high risk of bias,w5 w6 w12 w19 and the remaining trials were graded as moderate (table 2⇓). A Peto odds ratio was used for the comparison of midline closure versus off-midline closure owing to the low event rate. Often, purely categorical data are summarised in the form of a contingency table. However, particularly when considering data analysis, it is common to use the term \"categorical data\" to apply to data sets that, while containing some categorical variables, may also contain non-categorical variables. A categorical variable that can take on exactly two values is termed a binary variable or a dichotomous variable; an important special case is the Bernoulli variable. Categorical variables with more than two possible values are called polytomous variables; categorical variables are often assumed to be polytomous unless otherwise specified. Discretization is treating continuous data as if it were categorical. Dichotomization is treating continuous data or polytomous variables as if they were binary variables. Regression analysis often treats category membership with one or more quantitative dummy variables. In the field of epidemiology, several basic tools of measurement are used to assess and analyze health-related data. These measurement tools include rates, ratios, and proportions. Rates are commonly used in epidemiology to determine the frequency of a particular event, such as the occurrence of a disease or a health condition, in a specific population over a given period. Rates are calculated by dividing the number of events by the population size and are usually presented as a rate per unit of time (e.g., cases per 1,000 individuals per year). Ratios are another important tool in epidemiology. They involve comparing two quantities or numbers, such as the ratio of the number of cases in one group to the number of cases in another group. Ratios are particularly useful when comparing disease occurrence or health outcomes between different populations or time points. Proportions are also commonly used in epidemiology and represent the fraction of a population or group that has a specific characteristic or outcome. Proportions are often expressed as percentages, which make them easier to understand and interpret. These basic tools of measurement, including rates, ratios, and proportions, are fundamental to epidemiological research. They help in assessing the magnitude and impact of disease, identifying patterns, and monitoring health outcomes within populations. By using these measurement tools, epidemiologists can gain valuable insights into the distribution and determinants of diseases, which is crucial for public health planning and intervention strategies. This paper presents the statistical plan for the main publication to avoid risk of outcome reporting bias, selective reporting, and data-driven results as an update to the published design and method for the trial. Patients, the statistician, and the conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The International Conference on Harmonization of good clinical practice and others recommends that clinical trials should be analyzed according to a pre-specified plan to prevent outcome reporting bias and data-driven analysis results [2–4]. The statistical analysis plan was amended to on the presentation of the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov before data analysis was commenced. The patients, the statistician, and conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The trial background, design, and rationale have been published . With three groups and thereby multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases . To limit the family-wise error rate to 0.05, considering two main comparisons and one exploratory comparison, we adjusted the significance level for the primary outcome to α = 0.025 (0.05/2) for each of the three comparisons . With an acceptable risk of type II error of 0.10, we estimated the necessary sample size. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed mean difference in the PF (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of 55 mmHg and a standard deviation (SD) of 50 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion , and an assumed mean difference in the PF ratio of 150 mmHg and a SD of 110 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion . The sample size estimation showed that we would need 22 patients in two groups to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 55 mmHg in the PF ratio between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion. We therefore estimated that we would need three groups of 30 patients to preserve power in the complete case analysis in case of eventual patient dropouts or loss to follow-up. To calculate a hypothetical sample size for this comparison we set a value for the anticipated mean difference and SD to 30 mmHg and 30 mmHg, respectively. With a significance level for the primary outcome still being α = 0.025 and the power set to 90%, we calculated the sample size for this comparison to be 26 patients in each group. We will use preoperative lung function as a stratification variable. The outcomes will be defined as primary, secondary, and exploratory. The exploratory outcome measures will be reported in a separate publication(s). A list of the selected serious adverse events is displayed in Table 1. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification stage II or worse. If the result of the primary outcome is not statistically significant, the conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the interventions. The results on all other types of outcomes will be reported for hypothesis-generating purposes. However, we will inspect the confidence interval (CI) to asses if the CI for the group difference contains values of importance, so that we cannot rule out interesting differences.

By using these measurement tools, epidemiologists can gain valuable insights into the distribution and determinants of diseases, which is crucial for public health planning and intervention strategies. This paper presents the statistical plan for the main publication to avoid risk of outcome reporting bias, selective reporting, and data-driven results as an update to the published design and method for the trial. Patients, the statistician, and the conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The International Conference on Harmonization of good clinical practice and others recommends that clinical trials should be analyzed according to a pre-specified plan to prevent outcome reporting bias and data-driven analysis results [2–4]. The statistical analysis plan was amended to on the presentation of the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov before data analysis was commenced. The patients, the statistician, and conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The trial background, design, and rationale have been published . With three groups and thereby multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases . To limit the family-wise error rate to 0.05, considering two main comparisons and one exploratory comparison, we adjusted the significance level for the primary outcome to α = 0.025 (0.05/2) for each of the three comparisons . With an acceptable risk of type II error of 0.10, we estimated the necessary sample size. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed mean difference in the PF (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of 55 mmHg and a standard deviation (SD) of 50 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion , and an assumed mean difference in the PF ratio of 150 mmHg and a SD of 110 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion . The sample size estimation showed that we would need 22 patients in two groups to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 55 mmHg in the PF ratio between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion. We therefore estimated that we would need three groups of 30 patients to preserve power in the complete case analysis in case of eventual patient dropouts or loss to follow-up. To calculate a hypothetical sample size for this comparison we set a value for the anticipated mean difference and SD to 30 mmHg and 30 mmHg, respectively. With a significance level for the primary outcome still being α = 0.025 and the power set to 90%, we calculated the sample size for this comparison to be 26 patients in each group. We will use preoperative lung function as a stratification variable. The outcomes will be defined as primary, secondary, and exploratory. The exploratory outcome measures will be reported in a separate publication(s). A list of the selected serious adverse events is displayed in Table 1. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification stage II or worse. If the result of the primary outcome is not statistically significant, the conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the interventions. The results on all other types of outcomes will be reported for hypothesis-generating purposes. However, we will inspect the confidence interval (CI) to asses if the CI for the group difference contains values of importance, so that we cannot rule out interesting differences. The primary analysis will include a modified intention-to-treat population, which is defined as all randomized patients, except patients who did not receive CPB-dependent cardiac\n\n"

Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: either the LIFUP administration will be designed to increase the activity of neurons in a certain part of the brain or decrease the activity of neurons. Initially, subjects will undergo a screening assessment with a study physician to determine medical and psychiatric history, establish AD diagnosis, and undergo a blood draw, if standard recent labs for dementia and EKG are unavailable. Subjects that meet criteria and agree to participate in the study will undergo a follow-up visit. In the baseline measurement visit, participants will first undergo neuropsychological testing. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two LIFUP pulsing paradigms. Sixty minutes following the administration, participants will undergo a second neuropsychological test. This study aims to develop and evaluate in-home assistive technology that is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. The purpose of this study is to better understand the experience of living alone in older age with cognitive impairment. This study investigates the priorities and concerns of older adults living alone with cognitive impairment. The Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) is a non-randomized, natural history, non-treatment study designed to look at disease progression in individuals with early onset cognitive impairment . To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with mild AD. The purpose of this pilot study will be to test whether Kundalini yoga (KY) and Kirtan Kriya (KK) yogic meditation is superior to Memory Enhancement Training (MET) for improving cognitive functioning, health (including cardiovascular factors), and mood in women with high AD risk. The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a culturally-appropriate intervention to reduce stress in Vietnamese dementia caregivers. This will be done by randomly assigning a family triad (primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, and their care recipient) into an active intervention or a control condition and monitoring findings at baseline, post-intervention, and at three months.The intervention will consist of multiple components -enhanced psycho-education that includes discussion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and cultural impacts on beliefs about dementia and caregiving, management of problem behaviors, facilitation of support seeking, and mindful Tai Chi. A secondary caregiver who the primary caregiver identifies as providing him/her with the most support will be invited to join all components, but the intervention will be flexible depending on caregivers' needs/preferences. The care recipient is not required to join the sessions but will be able to if he/she or the family wishes. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of at least two dose levels of intravenous (IV) crenezumab in 24-72 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) (mini-mental state examination [MMSE] 18 to 28 points, inclusive). Participants who consent to be part of the sub study will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. This is a Phase I, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to test the safety and efficacy\n\nSchizophrenia is a complex, polygenic disorder for which over 100 genetic variants have been identified that correlate with diagnosis. However, the biological mechanisms underpinning the different symptom clusters remain undefined. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent large-scale meta-analyses have been extremely successful in identifying large numbers of associations (>100) between common genetic variants and schizophrenia . The reduction of complex traits such as schizophrenia to the binary classification of case/control in GWAS leaves much uncertainty around the exact role of many of the associated variants in the aetiology of disease. The variant has been shown to correlate with altered neuroanatomy [8–11], abnormal neurophysiology [12, 13] and in particular changes in neurocognitive phenotypes [11, 14]. For example, researchers using functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) found evidence that healthy subjects carrying the rs1344706 risk variant showed changes in functional connectivity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task [15, 16]. Whilst cognitive defects are an established and well-studied feature of schizophrenia [17, 18], more recently, links have been made between the cognitive symptom dimension and another feature of the condition - abnormal sleep patterns. Sleep disturbances have long been described in schizophrenia [19, 20] with studies consistently reporting altered sleep architecture where patients show increased sleep latency (time taken to fall asleep), decreased total sleep time and other altered sleep variables - both on neuroleptic treatment and in the absence of medication [21, 22]. Moreover, sleep deprivation can severely impair memory consolidation . Human sleep can be classified into stages based on key features observed when monitoring brain activity (Electroencephalography; EEG), eye movement (Electrooculography; EOG) and muscle tone (Electromyography; EMG). The two main sleep stages are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (further divided into stages 1–3) [32, 33]. More specifically, memory consolidation has been shown to correlate with spindle activity [34–36]. Spindle oscillations (a train of distinctive waves; 11–16 Hz, ≥0.5 s) are a feature found in the EEG during lighter NREM (stage 2) and arise from neuronal network oscillations spanning the cortex and thalamus. Spindle activity has also been shown to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia , and reduced spindle number and density correlated with impaired overnight improvement in a motor sequence task (MST) (also in patients). Overall there is growing evidence that circuit abnormalities in schizophrenia link to changes in sleep physiology which in turn may contribute to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia [39, 40]. The study of sleep phenotypes in patients with schizophrenia can be challenging, both in terms of recruitment of participants and study implementation. In many instances, issues around ethics, safety, and illness limit recruitment and bias samples to those with relatively mild disease severity. Where associations are observed, there are also issues around establishing the direction of causality. So far, efforts have been made to minimise limitations by recruiting medication-naïve participants and by studying phenotypes in the first degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia . All participants will be asked to complete a written consent form on their first visit and they will be asked for continued consent verbally on their second visit. Participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any time. Participants will be appropriately reimbursed for their time and effort (as judged against other contemporary study initiatives) and all travel expenses will be reimbursed.

Similar results were seen in a study conducted by Changizi and Hall (2001), which \n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the effects of musical mnemonics vs. spoken word in training verbal memory in children. A randomized control trial of typically-developing 9–11 year old children was conducted using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), a test measuring a participant's ability to recall a list of 15 words over multiple exposures. Members of the group who listened to words sung to them recalled an average of 20% more words after listening to and recalling an interference list than members of the control group who listened to the same words spoken. This difference persisted, though slightly smaller (17%) when participants recalled words after a 15-min waiting period. Memory is a critical component of cognitive functioning and deficits to verbal memory are a feature of many neurological disorders and injuries, including traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, epilepsy, stroke, developmental disability, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Down syndrome (Dehn, 2010). Increased understanding of the effects of this learning strategy may lead to improved academic performance for typically developing children, those who struggle with traditional approaches to learning, and individuals with deficits in memory due to injury or illness. In trials of verbal memory, primacy refers to words initially presented in a learning list and primacy was found to be affected by memory dysfunction (Lezak, 1983). In normative trials with typically-developing 9–10 year-olds, serial position effects were noted for both primacy and recency (words presented at the end of the list; Forrester and Geffen, 1991). Given these known patterns of learning with both memory disordered and typical populations, it is also important to consider the effects of serial order in learning using musical mnemonics. Studies of individuals without hearing revealed decreased prefrontal cortical development as well as poorer performance on tests of sequencing than age matched controls with normal hearing (Conway et al., 2009). As music is an entirely time ordered auditory language that utilizes a hierarchy of notes, phrases, motives and rhythms to organize and group information (Deutsch, 1982), it may provide additional structure in working memory tasks akin to Miller's “chunking” observations Miller (1956). Correlational studies have found links between memory performance and musical training. (1998) found that adults who had musical training before the age of 12 had significantly better verbal memory performance than age-matched peers without early musical training. (2003) found similar results with a child population. George and Coch (2011) compared event-related potential (ERP) data and performance on a standardized test of working memory of musicians and non-musicians and found both better performance measures as well as ERP data suggesting more efficient working memory performance in musicians. An experimental study of 4–6 year old children engaged in 1 year of Suzuki-based violin instruction performed better and improved more significantly than their age matched peers in digit span memory tests (Fujioka et al., 2006). Taken together, these correlational and experimental data support theories that musical training has a transfer effect upon a participant's working memory ability. An early study by Gfeller (1983) with children with learning disabilities found improved learning of verbal information when presented sung. Further study of training with musical templates was conducted by Wolfe and Hom (1993). To understand the effects of musical templates on children with learning disabilities, Claussen and Thaut (1997) presented multiplication tables in spoken or sung forms. As in earlier trials, participants receiving the sung condition outperformed their peers who heard the spoken presentation of multiplication tables. To better understand potential mechanisms of verbal learning training using music, Peterson and Thaut (2007) used electroencephalograph (EEG) measures to compare a sung version of the RAVLT with the conventional spoken version in a randomized trial with 18–26 year olds. The study authors found an increased oscillatory synchronization both within and between left and right prefrontal cortical areas in the group training with sung presentations of words. Study authors arrived at their dependent variable of learning related change in coherence (LRCC) (p. 218) by measuring synchronous firing of proximal pairs of scalp electrodes in one hemisphere with synchronous firing in the opposite hemisphere when a new word was recalled, suggesting a key physiological difference in brain activity during verbal learning using musical templates vs. spoken templates. This study also found increased bilateral synchronization of the prefrontal cortices in participants who heard the word lists sung compared to those who heard the lists spoken. Building on previous studies of musical mnemonics, the present study investigated the effect of musical mnemonics in typically developing children using assessments and procedures previously primarily researched with adults and clinical populations by utilizing a musical translation of the RAVLT which has been widely used for quantifying verbal learning and memory across a range of ages (Schmidt, 1996). This study with typically developing children demonstrates the immediate effects of verbal memory training with rhythmic and melodic templates and provides a baseline for further investigation with special populations. All parents responded to the call for participants via email or phone and were directed to consider inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine if their child was “typically developing,” with normal hearing and without any known developmental or sensory processing disorders.

In the precontemplation stage, patients may not even be aware that there is a need to change their behaviors. Therefore, the primary measure to take in this stage is to provide information and raise awareness about the health-related behaviors that are relevant to the patient's condition. In the contemplation stage, patients become aware of the need to change their behaviors but may still have mixed feelings or ambivalence towards making a change. Here, it is crucial to offer support and guidance to help patients weigh the pros and cons of behavior change. This can involve discussing the benefits and risks of adopting healthier behaviors, empathizing with their concerns, and addressing any fears or barriers they may have. By addressing their doubts and uncertainties, patients can progress to the next stage of preparation. During the preparation stage, patients are ready to take action and make changes in their health-related behaviors. In the action stage, patients actively modify their behaviors and implement the changes they have planned. Finally, in the maintenance stage, the focus shifts towards helping patients sustain their adopted behaviors in the long term. By reinforcing the benefits of the changed behaviors and helping patients overcome setbacks, healthcare providers can contribute to the successful maintenance of healthy behaviors. In summary, when dealing with patients who have limited understanding of health-related behaviors, it is important to tailor interventions based on the stages of the behavior change model. The Stages of Change Model and the Decisional Balance Model are both frameworks used to understand intentional behavior change, particularly in the context of medication adherence. The Stages of Change Model, also known as the Transtheoretical Model, describes different stages that individuals go through when making a behavior change. These stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse. The model helps to assess an individual's readiness to change and predict their likelihood of successfully adopting a new behavior or maintaining it over time. For example, someone may be more likely to adhere to their medication regimen if they perceive significant benefits from taking the medication outweighing any potential risks or concerns. Research has shown a relationship between these two models. In the early stages of behavior change (such as contemplation and preparation), individuals may engage in a decisional balance process where they weigh the pros and cons of adopting a new behavior or adhering to medication regimens. Overall, understanding both the Stages of Change Model and the Decisional Balance Model can provide valuable insights into intentional behavior change processes like medication adherence. By considering an individual's readiness for change along with their perception of benefits and concerns, healthcare professionals can tailor interventions to support successful behavior change efforts.

A list is not a model; a list does not push practitioners \n\nThe transtheoretical model, also known as the Stages of Change model, is a theoretical framework that nurses can use to support behavior change in clients with hypertension. This model was developed by Prochaska and DiClemente in 1983 and has been widely used in various healthcare settings. The transtheoretical model suggests that individuals go through different stages as they change their behaviors. Precontemplation: In this stage, individuals are not considering changing their behavior in the next six months. Action: In this stage, individuals have made specific modifications to their behavior and are actively working towards achieving their desired goal. Maintenance: In this stage, individuals have successfully changed their behavior and are working on maintaining it over time. - For clients in the maintenance stage, nurses can help them develop strategies to prevent relapse and maintain long-term behavior change. By using the transtheoretical model, nurses can provide individualized care that takes into account each client's readiness for change.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional psychology.

        "gold": "C",
        "context": "One common model is the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), which consists of five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. In the precontemplation stage, patients may not even be aware that there is a need to change their behaviors. Therefore, the primary measure to take in this stage is to provide information and raise awareness about the health-related behaviors that are relevant to the patient's condition. In the contemplation stage, patients become aware of the need to change their behaviors but may still have mixed feelings or ambivalence towards making a change. Here, it is crucial to offer support and guidance to help patients weigh the pros and cons of behavior change. This can involve discussing the benefits and risks of adopting healthier behaviors, empathizing with their concerns, and addressing any fears or barriers they may have. By addressing their doubts and uncertainties, patients can progress to the next stage of preparation. During the preparation stage, patients are ready to take action and make changes in their health-related behaviors. In the action stage, patients actively modify their behaviors and implement the changes they have planned. Finally, in the maintenance stage, the focus shifts towards helping patients sustain their adopted behaviors in the long term. By reinforcing the benefits of the changed behaviors and helping patients overcome setbacks, healthcare providers can contribute to the successful maintenance of healthy behaviors. In summary, when dealing with patients who have limited understanding of health-related behaviors, it is important to tailor interventions based on the stages of the behavior change model. The Stages of Change Model and the Decisional Balance Model are both frameworks used to understand intentional behavior change, particularly in the context of medication adherence. The Stages of Change Model, also known as the Transtheoretical Model, describes different stages that individuals go through when making a behavior change. These stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse. The model helps to assess an individual's readiness to change and predict their likelihood of successfully adopting a new behavior or maintaining it over time. For example, someone may be more likely to adhere to their medication regimen if they perceive significant benefits from taking the medication outweighing any potential risks or concerns. Research has shown a relationship between these two models. In the early stages of behavior change (such as contemplation and preparation), individuals may engage in a decisional balance process where they weigh the pros and cons of adopting a new behavior or adhering to medication regimens. Overall, understanding both the Stages of Change Model and the Decisional Balance Model can provide valuable insights into intentional behavior change processes like medication adherence. By considering an individual's readiness for change along with their perception of benefits and concerns, healthcare professionals can tailor interventions to support successful behavior change efforts.
