It is also more common in adolescence as the pelvis may not have finished growing by the time they give birth. In Africa and Asia obstructed labor affects between two and five percent of deliveries. A relationship between maternal height and pelvis size is present and can be used to predict the possibility of obstructed labor. This relationship is a result of the mother's nutritional health throughout her life leading up to childbirth. Evolution Obstructed labor is more common in humans than any other species and continues to be a main cause of birth complications today. Modern humans have morphologically evolved to survive as bipeds, however, bipedalism has resulted in skeletal changes that have consequently narrowed the pelvis and the birth canal. The combination of increased brain size and changes in pelvic structure are the major contributors of obstructed labor in modern humans. However, morphological shifts in pelvic structure still account for the inability of a fetus to effectively pass through the birth canal without major complications Other primates have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Mismatch between birth canal size and infant cranial width and length due to bipedal locomotion requirements have often been referred to as the obstetric dilemma, since compared to other great apes, modern humans have the greatest disproportion between infant cranial size and birth canal size. Shrinking of upper extremities and curvature of the spine have also affected the way modern humans give birth. Quadruped apes have longer upper limbs that allow them to reach down and pull their fetus out of the birth canal unassisted. Other primates also have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Modern human’s shorter upper extremities and evolution of bipedal locomotion have forced them to rely on assistance during labor. For this reason, researchers argue that assisted labor may have evolved with bipedalism. For over 1,000 years obstetricians have had to forcibly remove obstructed labor fetuses to prevent the death of the mother. Obstructed labor is unique to humans compared to other primates. The evolution of humans to become obligate bipedal and increase in brain size create the problems associated with obstructed labor. In order for bipedal locomotion to be possible, many changes had to occur to the skeletal structure of humans, especially in the pelvis. Both the shape and orientation of the pelvis changed. Other primates have straighter and wider pelvises compared to humans. A narrow pelvis is better for bipedal locomotion but makes childbirth more difficult. The pelvis is sexually dimorphic, with females having a wider pelvis to be better suited for childbirth. However, the female pelvis still must accommodate for bipedal locomotion which is what creates the challenges for obstructed labor. The brain size of humans has also increased as the species has evolved, resulting in a larger head of the fetus that must exit the womb. This requires human infants to be born less developed when compared to other species. The bones of the skull are not yet fused when a human infant is born in order to prevent the head from becoming too large to exit the womb. Creating education programs about reproduction and increasing access to reproductive services such as contraception and family planning in developing areas can also reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor. Caesarean section is an invasive method but is often the only method that will save the lives of both the mother and the infant. When the mother is depleted of energy, the contractions become weaker and labor will become increasingly longer. Prolonged obstructed labour can lead to stillbirth, obstetric fistula, and maternal death. Epidemiology In 2013 it resulted in 19,000 maternal deaths down from 29,000 deaths in 1990.

Evolution Obstructed labor is more common in humans than any other species and continues to be a main cause of birth complications today. Modern humans have morphologically evolved to survive as bipeds, however, bipedalism has resulted in skeletal changes that have consequently narrowed the pelvis and the birth canal. The combination of increased brain size and changes in pelvic structure are the major contributors of obstructed labor in modern humans. However, morphological shifts in pelvic structure still account for the inability of a fetus to effectively pass through the birth canal without major complications Other primates have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Mismatch between birth canal size and infant cranial width and length due to bipedal locomotion requirements have often been referred to as the obstetric dilemma, since compared to other great apes, modern humans have the greatest disproportion between infant cranial size and birth canal size. Shrinking of upper extremities and curvature of the spine have also affected the way modern humans give birth. Quadruped apes have longer upper limbs that allow them to reach down and pull their fetus out of the birth canal unassisted. Other primates also have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Modern human’s shorter upper extremities and evolution of bipedal locomotion have forced them to rely on assistance during labor. For this reason, researchers argue that assisted labor may have evolved with bipedalism. For over 1,000 years obstetricians have had to forcibly remove obstructed labor fetuses to prevent the death of the mother. Obstructed labor is unique to humans compared to other primates. The evolution of humans to become obligate bipedal and increase in brain size create the problems associated with obstructed labor. In order for bipedal locomotion to be possible, many changes had to occur to the skeletal structure of humans, especially in the pelvis. Both the shape and orientation of the pelvis changed. Other primates have straighter and wider pelvises compared to humans. A narrow pelvis is better for bipedal locomotion but makes childbirth more difficult. The pelvis is sexually dimorphic, with females having a wider pelvis to be better suited for childbirth. However, the female pelvis still must accommodate for bipedal locomotion which is what creates the challenges for obstructed labor. The brain size of humans has also increased as the species has evolved, resulting in a larger head of the fetus that must exit the womb. This requires human infants to be born less developed when compared to other species. The bones of the skull are not yet fused when a human infant is born in order to prevent the head from becoming too large to exit the womb. Creating education programs about reproduction and increasing access to reproductive services such as contraception and family planning in developing areas can also reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor. Caesarean section is an invasive method but is often the only method that will save the lives of both the mother and the infant. When the mother is depleted of energy, the contractions become weaker and labor will become increasingly longer.

Lidar has been successful in identifying permanent structures built by large-scale complex agriculturalist societies. In addition to these large-scale structures, lidar can also detect smaller and more practical modifications of landscapes made by smaller-scale societies.

Some important discoveries by archaeologists studying ancient history include:\n\n Magnetic measurements have been used to investigate past climate. Oxford Archaeology has incorporated digital survey techniques into its geomatics work. The most notable of these techniques is photogrammetric mapping, which uses photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create accurate three-dimensional models of the archaeological evidence, including artefacts, historic buildings or whole landscapes. During excavations by OAS at Westgate Oxford, the site of a medieval Greyfriars friary, three-dimensional models were generated through a combination of standard archaeological survey techniques and photogrammetric or structure from motion techniques. It has been increasingly used by archaeologists to overcome the limitations of field-based reconnaissance and other remote sensing techniques in forested settings. Lidar has been successful in identifying permanent structures built by large-scale complex agriculturalist societies. In addition to these large-scale structures, lidar can also detect smaller and more practical modifications of landscapes made by smaller-scale societies. Therefore, lidar can be used to detect microtopographic features in a forested landscape, including archaeological sites such as cache pit clusters created by mobile hunter-gatherer societies.\n\n"
