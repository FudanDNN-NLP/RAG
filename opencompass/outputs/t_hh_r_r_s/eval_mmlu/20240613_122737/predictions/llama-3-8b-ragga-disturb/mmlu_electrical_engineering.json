Another factor is the robustness of the probes. Following proper calibration procedures and periodically verifying the accuracy of the thermocouples is important for reliable results. Conduction errors, which can occur due to improper insulation or faulty connections, should be minimized in the construction of thermocouples. Lastly, the response time of the thermocouples is a significant factor. Faster response times allow for real-time monitoring and adjustments during hyperthermia treatments. Optimizing the design and construction of the thermocouples to enable rapid and accurate temperature measurements contributes to their satisfactory performance. By considering these factors, following strict quality assurance guidelines, and ensuring proper construction, calibration, robustness, minimized conduction errors, and optimal response time, in-house manufactured thermocouples can perform satisfactorily in hyperthermia clinics. To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. To measure such resistances requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances. it is sensitive to the measured property ; it is insensitive to any other property likely to be encountered in its application, and ; it does not influence the measured property. For example, if a sensor measures temperature and has a voltage output, the sensitivity is a constant with the units [V/K]. The sensitivity is the slope of the transfer function. An ammeter is connected in series with the primary winding. A voltmeter is optional since the applied voltage is the same as the voltmeter reading. Now with the help of variac applied voltage is slowly increased until the ammeter gives reading equal to the rated current  of the HV side.

As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the iron losses in transformer can be taken as negligible here. Current Errors: The interaction between sources can also result in current errors at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the errors are mainly caused by mutual resistance, while at high frequencies, they are primarily due to mutual inductance. These factors were observed and studied through the establishment of an equivalent circuit model and simulations of the output current of two sources in different scenarios.

        "context": "The satisfactory performance of in-house manufactured thermocouples in hyperthermia clinics can be attributed to several factors. Another factor is the robustness of the probes. Following proper calibration procedures and periodically verifying the accuracy of the thermocouples is important for reliable results. Conduction errors, which can occur due to improper insulation or faulty connections, should be minimized in the construction of thermocouples. Lastly, the response time of the thermocouples is a significant factor. Faster response times allow for real-time monitoring and adjustments during hyperthermia treatments. Optimizing the design and construction of the thermocouples to enable rapid and accurate temperature measurements contributes to their satisfactory performance. By considering these factors, following strict quality assurance guidelines, and ensuring proper construction, calibration, robustness, minimized conduction errors, and optimal response time, in-house manufactured thermocouples can perform satisfactorily in hyperthermia clinics. To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. To measure such resistances requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances. it is sensitive to the measured property ; it is insensitive to any other property likely to be encountered in its application, and ; it does not influence the measured property. For example, if a sensor measures temperature and has a voltage output, the sensitivity is a constant with the units [V/K]. The sensitivity is the slope of the transfer function. An ammeter is connected in series with the primary winding. A voltmeter is optional since the applied voltage is the same as the voltmeter reading. Now with the help of variac applied voltage is slowly increased until the ammeter gives reading equal to the rated current  of the HV side. After reaching at rated current  of HV side, all three instruments reading (Voltmeter, Ammeter and Watt-meter readings) are recorded. The ammeter reading gives the primary equivalent of full load current IL. As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the iron losses in transformer can be taken as negligible here. Current Errors: The interaction between sources can also result in current errors at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the errors are mainly caused by mutual resistance, while at high frequencies, they are primarily due to mutual inductance. These factors were observed and studied through the establishment of an equivalent circuit model and simulations of the output current of two sources in different scenarios. Overall, understanding and considering the mutual resistance and mutual inductance between adjacent grounded sources, as well as the resulting current errors, are crucial for accurately assessing the interaction in frequency domain semi-airborne electromagnetic surveys.\n\n"

Electrosurgery, by contrast, uses radio frequency (RF) alternating current to heat the tissue by RF induced intracellular oscillation of ionized molecules that result in an elevation of intracellular temperature. While the process is technically a process of electrocoagulation, the term \"electrocautery\" is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. This effect is most widely used in microwave ovens or some tissue ablative devices which operate at gigahertz frequencies. Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes. RF electrosurgery is commonly used in virtually all surgical disciplines including dermatological, gynecological, cardiac, plastic, ocular, spine, ENT, maxillofacial, orthopedic, urological, neuro- and general surgical procedures as well as certain dental procedures. RF electrosurgery is performed using a RF electrosurgical generator (also referred to as an electrosurgical unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes—a monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF electrosurgery is bipolar so the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design. The monopolar instrument called an \"active electrode\" when energized, requires the application of another monopolar instrument called a \"dispersive electrode\" elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue. The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, so it is not \"neutral\". The term \"return electrode\" is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit. Stimulation threshold does not vary much at low frequencies (so called rheobase-constant level). Typically, chronaxie of neural cells is in the range of 0.1–10 ms, so the sensitivity to electrical stimulation (inverse of the stimulation threshold) decreases with increasing frequency in the kHz range and above. (Note that frequency of the alternating electric current is an inverse of the duration of a single cycle). To minimize the effects of muscle and neural stimulation, electrosurgical equipment typically operates in the radio frequency (RF) range of 100 kHz to 5 MHz. Operation at higher frequencies also helps minimizing the amount of hydrogen and oxygen generated by electrolysis of water. This is especially important consideration for applications in liquid medium in closed compartments, where generation of gas bubbles may interfere with the procedure. Common electrode configurations for devices with isolated circuits There are several commonly used electrode configurations or circuit topologies: With \"bipolar\" instruments the current is applied to the patient using a pair of similarly-sized electrodes. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue. Since current density is higher in front of the smaller electrode, the heating and associated tissue effects take place only (or primarily) in front of the active electrode, and exact position of the dispersive electrode on tissue is not critical. Dedicated non-grounded machines without a dispersive electrode Relatively low-powered high frequency electrosurgery can be performed on conscious outpatients with no grounded machines without a dispersive electrode . Operating at low currents with no dispersive electrode is possible because, at the medium RF frequencies (usually 100 – 500 kHz) that the machines generate, the self-capacitance of the patient's body (which is between the patient's body and the machine's ground) is large enough to allow the resulting displacement current to act as a virtual \"circuit completion path.\" This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brand name Hyfrecator for \"High Frequency Eradicator\", but now serves generically to describe a general class of single-electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered electrosurgical machines intended mainly for office use.
