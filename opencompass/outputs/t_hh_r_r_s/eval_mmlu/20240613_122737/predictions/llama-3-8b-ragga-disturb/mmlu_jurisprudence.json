Whether there was any material difference between these two treatments became a question in the litigation. For example, under the Act, ‘public health’ includes prevention but also treatment (section 2B(3)), while the ‘health service’ includes treatment but also prevention (section 1(1)(b)). Finding clear distinctions within this legal framework is effectively impossible. When the case reached the Court of Appeal, one thing that was clear to all three judges was that the definition of ‘public health’ in the Act was so wide – ‘impossibly wide‘ – that to exclude everything falling within it from the responsibilities of NHS England would be to blow a huge hole in that body’s statutory remit. In his first instance judgment, Mr Justice Green attempted to sidestep the problem by holding that the apparent public health carve-out was no such thing, but just a provision about concurrency. This was treated dismissively by the Court of Appeal, which thought that the language of the Act incapable of supporting that conclusion (, , ). However, since it was also plainly not viable to distinguish health and public health on the basis of a simple difference between prevention and treatment , the Court had to find some other way of avoiding the apparent absurdity of the statutory drafting. Problematically, however, the Regulations were also ambiguous in key respects, and far from providing a clear answer to the question. Pragmatism was highly important here. However, he thought it ‘inherently very unlikely that the Secretary of State when making [the Regulations] intended that functions which were substantially identical should be split between different bodies‘ . What was important in his view was not when the medication in each case was administered, but when it had effect. This neat piece of logic, with which Lady Justice King agreed helped to bring the literal reading of the legislation into line with the pragmatic one. Like the majority of public bodies created by statute, NHS England has what are generally described as ‘incidental’ or ‘supplemental’ powers – using a fairly standard formulation: ‘to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any function‘ conferred by the Act (section 2). If they had otherwise identified a gap in NHS England’s powers, Longmore and King LJJ would have been prepared to find that it was plugged by this general power (, ). Underhill LJ was much less sure that he would have been prepared to give them such an expansive interpretation . Nothing in the case turned on it, but these differences in view identify how reluctant any public body should be to place reliance on the uncertain scope of its incidental powers, in particular in a controversial case. In public law terms, National Aids Trust is a case about using creative interpretive solutions in order to avoid absurdities in legislation. But it is worth asking why those absurdities arose at all.

The result is that physicians fail in their duty of care because patients suffer unnecessarily though effective and proven treatments exist. The problem, therefore, is to make sure that the physician’s intentions are beyond reproach. To begin with, Beauchamp and Childress have argued that intention depends on deliberation, reasoning, planning, volition and acting upon a premeditated blueprint (5). In this respect, Quill has argued that \"… clinical intentions may be complex, ambiguous and often contradictory\"(6). Moreover, ethical and medical considerations in specific cases may introduce further complications (7). However, challenges are likely in respect to an intention which has no clear outcome (i.e. For example, if the physician intends to ameliorate suffering as well as hasten death, escalating the dose of opioids would serve both purposes. Only by understanding the physician’s real intent can the legality of the action be ascertained, and it is in this judgement that ethical import becomes crucial. Our basic parameter for discussion is therefore understanding the true intention when it is alleged that two diametrically opposite objectives are in play (pain relief and killing a patient), but which are concealed through a single clinical action. This can be illustrated by the British case of R v Moor (reported in The Times, May 12, 1999). The judge in the case, Justice Hooper, directed the jury in a particular way: the evidence about the amount of morphine administered was not to be relied on. Nor should it be further inquired whether Liddell was terminally ill at the time: Moor clearly believed this to be the case (8, 9). In fact, the jury was to confine itself to two questions specific to intention: 1) whether Moor had intended to relieve the patient’s pain; and 2) whether the injection was intended to kill. In the ensuing court case a verdict of \"not guilty\" was recorded, thus indicating that the jury could not be certain of his intent to administer a lethal dose and therefore must acquit him of murder. On the facts of the case (Moor admitted that he had administered a lethal dose of drug in many other patients), it appeared that Moor acted primarily to alleviate pain, even while it was accepted that a foreseeable, but unintended effect of such an action was to hasten the death of the patient (8, 9). In this case, the doctor was not seeking the death of the patient through his actions because his goal was to relieve suffering. He may or may not have acknowledged that the possible adverse effect of symptom amelioration is premature death (14, 15). Dr Moor was therefore judged to have intended to ameliorate the patient’s suffering (any other decision would have indicated his guilt); death was merely the foreseen but unintended effect of the action taken to realise this primary intention. But this is the question that arises out of similar accusations of euthanasia: can the doctor really be naive, indifferent or oblivious to these consequences? Anscombe states that the notion of \"unknowability\" of intent is \"absurd\" and argues that the intent behind an action can be learnt from the action itself (17). Sulmasy adds that simple clinical acumen, and reflection on a particular action and the manner by which it was carried out, can clarify the intent behind an action (14). Tannjso adds that intent can be further understood by asking the physician whether, if there had been another way of treating these symptoms and which entailed fewer risks, he or she would have taken it (18). An affirmative answer indicates that the focus is on ameliorating suffering; a negative response would cast doubts on the true intent of the physician. In Cox, another infamous British case, the doctor was found guilty of attempted murder because his intention was clearly laid out by the administration of a tranquilliser and potassium chloride, which could only have been meant to hasten the death of his patient (a terminally ill woman in extreme pain). Within a common law system – one in which ethical principles come to the fore because they are used as the basis of argument and redress – it would seem that the doctor’s intentions could be at least partially revealed by reviewing the relevant case notes and associated clinical documentation in any patient’s treatment.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

Hardin proposed that human freedom lies in the recognition and obedience to the laws dictated by human nature. Aquinas establishes four types of laws: eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. Eternal law “Gods providence rules the world…his reason evidently governs the entire community in the universe.” (91.1) Aquinas believes that eternal law is all God’s doing. “Human law originally sprang from nature.” (91.3) The last is Divine law which is important because “it belongs to any law to be directed to the common good at its end.” (91.4) Theses laws all go together and \n\n the standards of morality or constructs them. Thomas Aquinas wrote in the 13th century: \"the rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts\". He regarded people as by nature rational beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable.
