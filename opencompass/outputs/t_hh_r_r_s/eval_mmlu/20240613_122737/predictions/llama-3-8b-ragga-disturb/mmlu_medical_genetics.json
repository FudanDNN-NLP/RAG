A gene fusion may be created when the translocation joins two otherwise-separated genes. Translocations can be balanced (in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing, and ideally full functionality) or unbalanced (where the exchange of chromosome material is unequal resulting in extra or missing genes). Reciprocal translocations\nReciprocal translocations are usually an exchange of material between non-homologous chromosomes and occur in about 1 in 491 live births. Such translocations are usually harmless and may be found through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to distinguish between chromosomal translocations occurring in gametogenesis, due to errors in meiosis, and translocations that occur in cellular division of somatic cells, due to errors in mitosis. The former results in a chromosomal abnormality featured in all cells of the offspring, as in translocation carriers. Somatic translocations, on the other hand, result in abnormalities featured only in the affected cell line, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Robertsonian translocations\nRobertsonian translocation is a type of translocation caused by breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes 13 and 14 and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns. Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but there is a risk of unbalanced gametes that lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring. For example, carriers of Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 21 have a higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of uniparental disomy 14 due to trisomy rescue. Role in disease\nSome human diseases caused by translocations are:\n Cancer: Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations (as opposed to those present from conception); this has been described mainly in leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia). The translocation is the mechanism that can cause a gene to move from one linkage group to another.

This occurs when two fragments from different chromosomes are switched. On the other hand, Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes become attached together, resulting in the fusion of one part of each chromosome. Reciprocal translocations are usually harmless and can be detected through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to note that most carriers of balanced translocations are healthy and do not experience any symptoms. Robertsonian translocations, on the other hand, involve the fusion of two chromosomes. A gene fusion may result from this translocation, joining two separate genes. Robertsonian translocations are also detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype of affected cells. It is crucial to differentiate between chromosomal translocations that occur during gametogenesis (errors in meiosis) and those that happen in cellular division of somatic cells (errors in mitosis). Translocations in gametogenesis result in a chromosomal abnormality present in all cells of the offspring, such as translocation carriers. Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes get attached, meaning that given two healthy pairs of chromosomes, one of each pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. This is also true for humans, where non-random segregation occurs when structurally abnormal chromosomes are present as a result of Robertsonian translocations. On the other hand, Robertsonian translocation involves the attachment of two non-homologous chromosomes, where one pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. This type of translocation can be detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype analysis of affected cells. In contrast, Robertsonian translocation does not involve the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes but rather the fusion of two entire chromosomes. This type of translocation typically occurs between acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres located near one end) and may result in no extra or missing genetic information if it is balanced.

In this situation, the affected person will be the only person in their family to have the disease and the mutation will have happened spontaneously during conception and not have been passed down from the mother. Nuclear DNA mutations may be inherited from parents in a number of different ways: Recessive, Dominant or X-linked. With autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents carry a single faulty copy of the gene and also a healthy gene. The normal gene in a carrier usually supplies enough normal protein to avoid the signs and symptoms of the disease. With dominant inheritance, only one copy of the faulty gene is required in order to develop Mitochondrial Disease. This means that each person with the disease has a 50/50 chance of passing on the gene to any children they may have. However, with one normal and one faulty gene, all of these individuals may or may not develop symptoms of disease. In regards to the highly variable manifestations among individuals with a faulty gene, autosomal dominant and maternally inherited mitochondrial disorders are similar. In X-linked disease, the genetic defect is located on the \"X\" chromosome and usually affects males only. However, these females are at risk of passing on genetic disease and are called \"carriers\". On the other hand, since a male only has one X chromosome, if it is faulty he has no normal copy and will develop the disease represented by the genetic fault (mutation). If a female carrier has children, there is a 50/50 chance that she will pass on the faulty gene to her children. An identical twin of an affected individual has a 30% chance of developing MS, 5% for a non-identical twin, 2.5% for a sibling, and an even lower chance for a half-sibling. However, if an infant or child has only one copy, he or she are a carrier of the mutation.

Thus, if a male inherits the mutated gene from his carrier mother, he will be affected by the disease. If a carrier female passes on her mutated X chromosome to her offspring (regardless of the child's sex), there is a 50% chance that her son will inherit the mutated gene and be affected by the disease. To summarize, the inheritance pattern of an X-linked recessive disease involves a 50% chance of a male being affected if the female parent is a carrier, while females can be carriers themselves but are generally not affected by the disease due to the presence of a second X chromosome.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

Rueffert H, Rosenberg H Rueffert, Henrik, and Henry Rosenberg.Malignant Hyperthermia. Rueffert H, Rosenberg H. Rueffert H, Rosenberg H Rueffert, Henrik, and Henry Rosenberg.. \"Malignant Hyperthermia.\" Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered by potent halogenated volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants and in rare case by strenuous exercise and/or heat exposure, too. However, patients with central core disease (CCD) who are at risk for MH may display muscle weakness. The resulting hypermetabolic syndrome is characterized by typical clinical signs such as tachycardia, hypercapnia, acidosis, muscle rigidity, and breakdown as well as hyperthermia. The ryanodine receptor subtype 1 (RYR1; fast calcium-releasing channel) is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of MH. The response of the RYR1 to MH triggering substances is functionally affected in MH patients. Besides symptomatic therapy dantrolene sodium is the only effective and specific treatment drug for MH (RYR1 antagonist). DNA analysis can be used in up to 30% of MH families, mainly for the screening of family members that carry a MH-associated mutation in the RYR1 gene. A patient advocacy organization exists in the United States, Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) (www.mhaus.org). In Europe, the European MH Group (www.emhg.org) sponsors meetings and research into the syndrome. The disposition to MH is inherited in humans in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance and expressivity. The majority of MH cases (>70%) is linked to the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) located on chromosome 19q13.1 (MHS-1). There is a considerable allelic heterogeneity in the RYR1 gene with over 200 mutations which were detected in MH patients. About 30 RYR1 mutations were proven causal for MH. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis defects: McArdle's disease, phosphofructokinase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases VIII, IX, X and XI ; Lipid metabolism defects: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II deficiency, deficiency of subtypes of acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD, SCAD, MCAD, VLCAD, 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency), thiolase deficiency ; Mitochondrial myopathies: deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and coenzyme Q10 ; Others: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency and muscular dystrophies Recurrent rhabdomyolysis may result from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. The following hereditary disorders of the muscle energy supply may cause recurrent and usually exertional rhabdomyolysis:\n\n and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Blood tests show a creatine \n\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is indeed a genetic disorder characterized by a hypermetabolic response in skeletal muscle. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the condition. However, with prompt recognition and appropriate management, the prognosis is generally good. The underlying cause of MH is a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene. The specific mutation in the RYR1 gene leads to an abnormal release of calcium, which triggers an excessive release of calcium from the muscle's storage compartments. This dysregulation results in the hypermetabolic response seen in MH. Diagnosis of MH typically involves a combination of clinical signs and specific diagnostic testing, such as the caffeine-halothane contracture test or genetic testing to identify the RYR1 mutation. In conclusion, malignant hyperthermia is a genetically inherited disorder characterized by hypermetabolism in skeletal muscle.

Rueffert H, Rosenberg H Rueffert, Henrik, and Henry Rosenberg.. \"Malignant Hyperthermia.\" Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered by potent halogenated volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants and in rare case by strenuous exercise and/or heat exposure, too. However, patients with central core disease (CCD) who are at risk for MH may display muscle weakness. The resulting hypermetabolic syndrome is characterized by typical clinical signs such as tachycardia, hypercapnia, acidosis, muscle rigidity, and breakdown as well as hyperthermia. The ryanodine receptor subtype 1 (RYR1; fast calcium-releasing channel) is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of MH. The response of the RYR1 to MH triggering substances is functionally affected in MH patients. Besides symptomatic therapy dantrolene sodium is the only effective and specific treatment drug for MH (RYR1 antagonist). DNA analysis can be used in up to 30% of MH families, mainly for the screening of family members that carry a MH-associated mutation in the RYR1 gene. A patient advocacy organization exists in the United States, Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) (www.mhaus.org). In Europe, the European MH Group (www.emhg.org) sponsors meetings and research into the syndrome. The disposition to MH is inherited in humans in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance and expressivity. The majority of MH cases (>70%) is linked to the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) located on chromosome 19q13.1 (MHS-1). There is a considerable allelic heterogeneity in the RYR1 gene with over 200 mutations which were detected in MH patients. About 30 RYR1 mutations were proven causal for MH. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis defects: McArdle's disease, phosphofructokinase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases VIII, IX, X and XI ; Lipid metabolism defects: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II deficiency, deficiency of subtypes of acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD, SCAD, MCAD, VLCAD, 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency), thiolase deficiency ; Mitochondrial myopathies: deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and coenzyme Q10 ; Others: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency and muscular dystrophies Recurrent rhabdomyolysis may result from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. The following hereditary disorders of the muscle energy supply may cause recurrent and usually exertional rhabdomyolysis:\n\n and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Blood tests show a creatine \n\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is indeed a genetic disorder characterized by a hypermetabolic response in skeletal muscle. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the condition. However, with prompt recognition and appropriate management, the prognosis is generally good. The underlying cause of MH is a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene. The specific mutation in the RYR1 gene leads to an abnormal release of calcium, which triggers an excessive release of calcium from the muscle's storage compartments. This dysregulation results in the hypermetabolic response seen in MH. Diagnosis of MH typically involves a combination of clinical signs and specific diagnostic testing, such as the caffeine-halothane contracture test or genetic testing to identify the RYR1 mutation. In conclusion, malignant hyperthermia is a genetically inherited disorder characterized by hypermetabolism in skeletal muscle. Understanding the underlying genetic mutation and avoiding triggering factors is crucial for the proper management and prevention of MH episodes.\n\n"

These events have profound psychological, physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being such as unsocial behaviors, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Similarly, children with mothers who have experienced traumatic or stressful events during pregnancy can increase the child's risk of mental health disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 study on adverse childhood experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy self-destructive behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises. Health Traumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual's allostatic load and thus affects the immune system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and premature mortality. Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior. Psychological impact Childhood trauma can increase the risk of mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments. The conclusion of the study shows that there is a correlation between the effects of childhood trauma and the being at high risk for psychosis. Survivors of childhood trauma are also at higher risk of developing asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes or having a stroke. Epigenetics Childhood trauma can leave epigenetic marks on a child's genes, which chemically modify gene expression by silencing or activating genes. traumatic stress might have trans generational effects. Parental trauma exposure was found to be associated with greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood and anxiety disorders in offspring since biological alterations associated with PTSD and/or other stress-related disorders have also been observed in offspring of trauma survivors who do not themselves report trauma exposure or psychiatric disorder. Animal models have demonstrated that stress exposure can result in epigenetic alterations in the next generation, and such mechanisms have been hypothesized to underpin vulnerability to symptoms in offspring of trauma survivors. Enduring behavioral responses to stress and epigenetic alterations in adult offspring have been demonstrated to be mediated by changes in gametes in utero effects, variations in early postnatal care, and/or other early life experiences that are influenced by parental exposure (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer, and Binder, 2015). Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. Transgenerational effects People can pass their epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to their children. This is known as transgenerational trauma or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically. Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions. A growing body of literature suggests that children's experiences of trauma and abuse within close relationships not only jeopardize their well-being in childhood, but can also have long-lasting consequences that extend well into adulthood. These long-lasting consequences can include emotion regulation issues, which can then be passed onto subsequent generations through child-parent interactions and learned behaviors. (see also behavioral epigenetics, epigenetics, historical trauma, and cycle of violence) Resilience Exposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood. Therefore, there are factors that reduce the impact of potentially traumatic events and protect an individual from developing mental health problems after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Research regarding children who showed adaptive development while facing adversity began in the 1970s and continues to this day.

Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and premature mortality. Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior. Psychological impact Childhood trauma can increase the risk of mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments. The conclusion of the study shows that there is a correlation between the effects of childhood trauma and the being at high risk for psychosis. Survivors of childhood trauma are also at higher risk of developing asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes or having a stroke. Epigenetics Childhood trauma can leave epigenetic marks on a child's genes, which chemically modify gene expression by silencing or activating genes. traumatic stress might have trans generational effects. Parental trauma exposure was found to be associated with greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood and anxiety disorders in offspring since biological alterations associated with PTSD and/or other stress-related disorders have also been observed in offspring of trauma survivors who do not themselves report trauma exposure or psychiatric disorder. Animal models have demonstrated that stress exposure can result in epigenetic alterations in the next generation, and such mechanisms have been hypothesized to underpin vulnerability to symptoms in offspring of trauma survivors. Enduring behavioral responses to stress and epigenetic alterations in adult offspring have been demonstrated to be mediated by changes in gametes in utero effects, variations in early postnatal care, and/or other early life experiences that are influenced by parental exposure (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer, and Binder, 2015). Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. Transgenerational effects People can pass their epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to their children. This is known as transgenerational trauma or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically. Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions. A growing body of literature suggests that children's experiences of trauma and abuse within close relationships not only jeopardize their well-being in childhood, but can also have long-lasting consequences that extend well into adulthood. These long-lasting consequences can include emotion regulation issues, which can then be passed onto subsequent generations through child-parent interactions and learned behaviors. (see also behavioral epigenetics, epigenetics, historical trauma, and cycle of violence) Resilience Exposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood. Therefore, there are factors that reduce the impact of potentially traumatic events and protect an individual from developing mental health problems after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Research regarding children who showed adaptive development while facing adversity began in the 1970s and continues to this day. These events have profound psychological, physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being such as unsocial behaviors, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Similarly, children with mothers who have experienced traumatic or stressful events during pregnancy can increase the child's risk of mental health disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 study on adverse childhood experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy self-destructive behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality.

A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene, which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms. Treatment is with a diet that (1) is low in foods that contain phenylalanine, and which (2) includes special supplements. Phenylketonuria affects about 1 in 12,000 babies. Signs and symptoms Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding. If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. The disease may present clinically with seizures, hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed. The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability (though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma, eczema, anemia, weight gain, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, gastritis, esophagus and kidney deficiencies, kidney stones, and hypertension). In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all. If both parents are carriers for PKU, there is a 25% chance any child they have will be born with the disorder, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance the child will neither develop nor be a carrier for the disease. PKU is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional. Pathophysiology When phenylalanine (Phe) cannot be metabolized by the body, a typical diet that would be healthy for people without PKU causes abnormally high levels of Phe to accumulate in the blood, which is toxic to the brain. If left untreated (and often even in treatment), complications of PKU include severe intellectual disability, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as physical symptoms such as a \"musty\" odor, eczema, and unusually light skin and hair coloration. Classical PKU Classical PKU, and its less severe forms \"mild PKU\" and \"mild hyperphenylalaninemia\" are caused by a mutated gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts the amino acid phenylalanine (\"Phe\") to other essential compounds in the body, in particular tyrosine.

One of the most significant risks is the potential for mental retardation. Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. The severity of mental retardation can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of phenylalanine and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. It is crucial for women with PKU who are planning to become pregnant, or are already pregnant, to strictly adhere to a low-phenylalanine diet. In addition to mental retardation, there are other potential health risks associated with children born to mothers with PKU. These may include developmental delays, growth abnormalities, microcephaly (a smaller head size), congenital heart defects, and behavioral problems. Each case is unique, and the severity of these risks can vary, depending on several factors such as the mother's phenylalanine level control and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Regular prenatal care and ongoing monitoring are essential to reduce the risks associated with PKU and optimize the health outcomes for both the mother and the child. Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system. PKU is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is needed to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Without proper treatment, phenylalanine levels can accumulate and lead to various complications. One of the main consequences of untreated PKU is problems with brain development. Additionally, individuals with untreated PKU are at an increased risk of developing seizures. A low-phenylalanine diet and a high-tyrosine diet are recommended for individuals with PKU. This involves avoiding foods that are high in phenylalanine, such as certain meats, dairy products, and some fruits and vegetables. Instead, individuals with PKU consume specially formulated medical foods that provide adequate nutrition while limiting their intake of phenylalanine. Strict adherence to this dietary management plan can bring about significant improvement in PKU symptoms and prevent long-term complications. It allows for normal growth and development while minimizing the risk of intellectual disability and seizures associated with untreated PKU. Overall, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of a low-phenylalanine diet are essential for effectively managing PKU and preventing its potential consequences on brain development and overall health.

Mechanism of action \nExonic splicing silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre-mRNA strands or promoting exon skipping. ESSs have four general roles:\n inhibiting exon inclusion\n inhibiting intron retention\n regulating alternative 5' splice site usage\n regulating alternative 3' splice site usage\n\nRole in genetic diseases\n\nMyotonic dystrophy \nMyotonic dystrophy (MD) is most noticeably caused by inheriting an unstable CTG triplet expansion in the DMPK gene. The ESS nucleotide sequence exists within intron 10 and is thought to be dependent on the CUG triplet repeat in order to silence the splicing of exon 11. Silencing exon 11 splicing leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform. A particular mutation occurs in the CFTR pre-mRNA and leads to the exclusion of exon 9, mRNA lacking this exon folds a truncated protein (a protein shortened by a mutation). Exclusion of exon 9 is mediated by a polymorphic locus with variable TG repeats and stretches of T nucleotides – this is abbreviated as (TG)mT(n). The silencing is related to the high number of TG repeats and decreased stretches of T repeats (T tracts). A combination of both these factors is shown to increase levels of exon skipping. Humans have two isoforms of the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene, SMN1 and SMN2. The SMN1 gene produces a complete transcript, while SMN2 produces a transcript without exon 7 which results in a truncated protein. This sequence arises when a C-to-T mutation occurs at position +6 in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene. This transition point mutation leads to the exclusion of exon 7 from the mRNA transcript, it is also the only difference between the SMN2 and SMN1 gene. Ataxia telangiecstasia \nMutations in the ATM gene are responsible for Ataxia telangiecstasia. These mutations are generally single base pair substitutions, deletions, or micro-insertions. The inclusion of the cryptic exon results in protein truncation and atypical splicing patterns. References \n\nGenetics\n\n Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused when a mutation in the DMD gene changes the DMD mRNA so that it no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein, usually due to a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the mRNA. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, by removing the defective exon the downstream reading frame can be corrected and production of partially functional dystrophin can be restored. Eteplirsen is a morpholino antisense oligomer which triggers excision of exon 51 during pre-mRNA splicing of the dystrophin RNA transcript. Skipping exon 51 changes the downstream reading frame of dystrophin; giving eteplirsen to a healthy person would result in production of dystrophin mRNA which would not code for functional dystrophin protein but, for DMD patients with particular nonsense mutations, giving eteplirsen can restore the reading frame of the dystrophin mRNA and result in production of functional (although modified by having an internal deletion consisting of both the patient's original defect, as well as the therapeutically skipped exon) dystrophin. Exon skipping is \n\nExonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are short regions of an exon that function as cis-regulatory elements to inhibit or silence the splicing of pre-mRNA. This inhibition can result in exon skipping or regulate the usage of alternative splice sites. They can inhibit exon inclusion, a process in which an exon is skipped during splicing, leading to the exclusion of the exon from the final mRNA transcript. For example, in myotonic dystrophy (MD), an unstable CTG triplet expansion in the DMPK gene leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform of the insulin receptor mRNA. This upregulation is caused by the ESS nucleotide sequence within intron 10, which silences the splicing of exon 11.

Mechanism of action \nExonic splicing silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre-mRNA strands or promoting exon skipping. ESSs have four general roles:\n inhibiting exon inclusion\n inhibiting intron retention\n regulating alternative 5' splice site usage\n regulating alternative 3' splice site usage\n\nRole in genetic diseases\n\nMyotonic dystrophy \nMyotonic dystrophy (MD) is most noticeably caused by inheriting an unstable CTG triplet expansion in the DMPK gene. The ESS nucleotide sequence exists within intron 10 and is thought to be dependent on the CUG triplet repeat in order to silence the splicing of exon 11. Silencing exon 11 splicing leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform. A particular mutation occurs in the CFTR pre-mRNA and leads to the exclusion of exon 9, mRNA lacking this exon folds a truncated protein (a protein shortened by a mutation). Exclusion of exon 9 is mediated by a polymorphic locus with variable TG repeats and stretches of T nucleotides – this is abbreviated as (TG)mT(n). The silencing is related to the high number of TG repeats and decreased stretches of T repeats (T tracts). A combination of both these factors is shown to increase levels of exon skipping. Humans have two isoforms of the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene, SMN1 and SMN2. The SMN1 gene produces a complete transcript, while SMN2 produces a transcript without exon 7 which results in a truncated protein. This sequence arises when a C-to-T mutation occurs at position +6 in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene. This transition point mutation leads to the exclusion of exon 7 from the mRNA transcript, it is also the only difference between the SMN2 and SMN1 gene.
