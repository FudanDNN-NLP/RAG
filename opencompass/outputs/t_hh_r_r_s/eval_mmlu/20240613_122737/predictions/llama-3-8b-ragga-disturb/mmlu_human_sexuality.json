Chemotherapy is not needed for DCIS since the disease is noninvasive. Radiation therapy\nUse of radiation therapy after lumpectomy provides equivalent survival rates to mastectomy, although there is a slightly higher risk of recurrent disease in the same breast in the form of further DCIS or invasive breast cancer. Systematic reviews (including a Cochrane review) indicate that the addition of radiation therapy to lumpectomy reduces recurrence of DCIS or later onset of invasive breast cancer in comparison with breast-conserving surgery alone, without affecting mortality. The Cochrane review did not find any evidence that the radiation therapy had any long-term toxic effects. The addition of radiation therapy to lumpectomy appears to reduce the risk of local recurrence to approximately 12%, of which approximately half will be DCIS and half will be invasive breast cancer; the risk of recurrence is 1% for women undergoing mastectomy.

References\n\nExternal links \n\nBreast cancer\n\nThere are several key factors related to mammography that are important to consider when discussing its potential risks and benefits. It is important to note that while mammography does involve exposure to a low level of radiation, the benefits of early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer often outweigh this risk. It plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer, as it can detect abnormalities such as lumps or calcifications before they can be felt during a physical examination. Early detection leads to earlier treatment and improved outcomes for patients. While it is true that mammography does involve exposure to radiation, the level of radiation used is generally very low. The amount of radiation exposure from a mammogram is comparable to the radiation exposure an individual receives from natural sources in the environment over a few months. In addition, modern mammography machines and techniques have been refined and optimized to minimize radiation exposure while still providing high-quality images.

Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Diagnosis is by testing the urine, urethra in males, or cervix in females. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms Gonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women Half of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants If not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread The infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis Traditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. In those failing initial treatment, culture should be done to determine sensitivity to antibiotics. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. For this reason, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing are often combined. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention As with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. Anal sex without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity, and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices \n\n the soldier or sailor would get after they were first infected can be confused for an ingrown hair, zipper cut, or other seemingly harmless bump. Men can be infected with syphilis and have very mild symptoms or none at all.

The infection spreads most often among people who have many sex partners.

An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms Gonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women Half of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants If not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread The infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis Traditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. In those failing initial treatment, culture should be done to determine sensitivity to antibiotics. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. For this reason, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing are often combined. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention As with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person.

Thus far, for all species of mammals investigated, the SDN has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females. SDN and its homologues exist widely in human, mammal, and some other animal brains, including: the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) in humans; ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (MPOA/AH) in sheep; sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in rats; anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc) in macaques; specific area in medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in quails; etc. Sexually dimorphic nucleus in medial preoptic area Formation and organization of SDN in medial preoptic area Sex differences in SDN caused by exposure to testosterone (prenatal) The volume of SDN in medial preoptic area is modified by hormones, among which testosterone is proved to be of much importance. Sex differences in the volume of SDN caused by apoptosis (postnatal) According to some studies, the volume difference of SDN between males and females is related to apoptosis during early development after birth. Apoptosis also occurs in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), which is also a sexually dimorphic area and is located in the periventricular gray area at the rostral extreme of the third ventricle. In contrast with SDN-POA, AVPV has larger size in females than in males. As indicated in these two cases, apoptotic cell death plays a critical role in the formation of sexually dimorphic nucleus, and the apoptotic cell number within SDN negatively correlates with the volume of SDN between different sexes. Role of SDN in controlling of male sexual behaviors Male sexual behaviors can be divided into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. It is found that large lesions of SDN-POA severely disrupt copulatory behavior in rats. Also, cell-body lesions of SDA pars compacta (a homologue of SDN-POA) in gerbils produce severe disruptions of male copulatory behavior. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromatization of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM. Appetitive behaviors are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive behaviors are disrupted by the lesions in rostral part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments showed that the level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests that some other parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior. Role of SDN in sexual partner preference Role of SDN in male partner preference Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep demonstrate that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN.

SDN and its homologues exist widely in human, mammal, and some other animal brains, including: the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) in humans; ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (MPOA/AH) in sheep; sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in rats; anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc) in macaques; specific area in medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in quails; etc. Sexually dimorphic nucleus in medial preoptic area Formation and organization of SDN in medial preoptic area Sex differences in SDN caused by exposure to testosterone (prenatal) The volume of SDN in medial preoptic area is modified by hormones, among which testosterone is proved to be of much importance. Sex differences in the volume of SDN caused by apoptosis (postnatal) According to some studies, the volume difference of SDN between males and females is related to apoptosis during early development after birth. Apoptosis also occurs in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), which is also a sexually dimorphic area and is located in the periventricular gray area at the rostral extreme of the third ventricle. In contrast with SDN-POA, AVPV has larger size in females than in males. As indicated in these two cases, apoptotic cell death plays a critical role in the formation of sexually dimorphic nucleus, and the apoptotic cell number within SDN negatively correlates with the volume of SDN between different sexes. Role of SDN in controlling of male sexual behaviors Male sexual behaviors can be divided into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. It is found that large lesions of SDN-POA severely disrupt copulatory behavior in rats. Also, cell-body lesions of SDA pars compacta (a homologue of SDN-POA) in gerbils produce severe disruptions of male copulatory behavior. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromatization of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM. Appetitive behaviors are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive behaviors are disrupted by the lesions in rostral part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments showed that the level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests that some other parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior. Role of SDN in sexual partner preference Role of SDN in male partner preference Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep demonstrate that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN. Damage of SDN and changes in sexual partner preferences in males Bilateral damage to SDN in the medial preoptic area in male ferrets causes the change of males from male-typical preference to female-typical preference. Male ferrets which were sexually experienced and responded to female body odor, when treated by bilateral lesions to SDN, change to respond to male body odor. Role of SDN in female partner preference Although SDN is much related to sexual partner preferences in males, it does not show the same relationship to partner preferences in females.

For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health Gender-specific risk factors Gender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health Adolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth.

This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health Adolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth.

For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 5.5% of women used an illicit drug, 18.8% used alcohol and 20.4% smoked cigarettes during pregnancy. While some drugs were studied many years ago, others have become topics of concern only in the past decade. Evidence from clinical reports and case studies suggests that a pregnant woman and her developing fetus are at risk for a wide range of potential problems when cocaine is present. Among the medical complications attributed to cocaine use in a pregnant woman are cardiovascular effects including acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, rupture of the ascending aorta, central nervous system complications including aneurysms due to increases in blood pressure, and other, less frequently occurring effects such as respiratory arrest and seizures. The medical complications that may result from the life-style associated with drug use include failure to seek proper prenatal care, nutritional deficits, and weight loss. Cocaine also crosses the placental barrier and can result in detrimental effects to the fetus. Clinical data indicate that the neonate exposed in utero to cocaine may have a lower gestational age at delivery, lower birth weight, decreased body length, and a smaller head circumference. Unfortunately, studies have also shown associations between cocaine use during pregnancy and the occurrence of fetal anomalies, including an increase in skull malformations, limb defects, urethral obstruction, enlarged bladder, cystic distension of the kidneys, and neural defects. Intrauterine fetal death also occurs more frequently in pregnant cocaine users than in nonusers. An increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been reported in infants of cocaine-using mothers, as well as other sleep pattern abnormalities such as apnea and deep sleep. In addition to effects on physical development, neurological and behavioral abnormalities observed in cocaine-exposed infants have included tremulousness, muscle rigidity, and poor performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS). Cocaine exposure has also been associated with brain stem auditory defects, perinatal cerebral infarction, and vision problems. Cocaine-exposed infants are largely unable to respond to the human voice and face, and are unable to interact with others. Most children who were exposed to cocaine before birth have normal intelligence. However, studies of cocaine-exposed school-aged children do suggest subtle effects on intelligence and behavior. Teachers also report more problem behaviors in cocaine-exposed children compared to unexposed children. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy can have significant risks and consequences for both the mother and the unborn child. The abuse of cocaine has been linked to various complications during pregnancy, including placental abruption, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Children exposed to cocaine in utero may experience cognitive and developmental issues. Studies have shown that cocaine-exposed children may have lower verbal-reasoning scores and smaller head circumference compared to non-exposed children. Furthermore, parental addiction to cocaine often leads to abuse and neglect of children. Growing up in an environment where cocaine abuse is present can also increase the risk of substance abuse and addiction later in life. It is important to note that these consequences are not limited to cocaine use alone. Substance abuse, including abuse of other substances and comorbid psychiatric illness, often co-occur with cocaine abuse. This can further exacerbate the risks and complications associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. Overall, the potential risks and consequences of cocaine abuse during pregnancy and for children exposed to cocaine in utero are serious. It is crucial for pregnant women to seek help and support to overcome substance abuse and prioritize the health and well-being of both themselves and their unborn child. Cocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. Cocaine use also results in low birthweight, damage to the central nervous system, and motor dysfunction. The vasoconstriction of the effects of cocaine lead to a decrease in placental blood flow to the fetus that results in fetal hypoxia that is oxygen deficiency and decreased fetal nutrition these vasoconstrictive effects on the placenta have been linked to the number of complications in malformations that are evident in the newborn. Maternal alcohol use leads to disruptions of the fetus's brain development, interferes with the fetus's cell development and organization, and affects the maturation of the central nervous system. Even small amounts of alcohol use can cause lower height, weight and head size at birth and higher aggressiveness and lower intelligence during childhood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that is a consequence of heavy alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug use while pregnant may be dangerous for the unborn baby and may lead to severe health problems and/or birth defects. Even small amounts of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana have not been proven to be safe when taken while pregnant. In some cases, for example, if the mother has epilepsy or diabetes, the risk of stopping a medication may be worse than risks associated with taking the medication while pregnant. In addition a reported 5–10% of women of childbearing age use alcohol or addictive substances. Of those who bear children, recreational drug use can have serious consequences to the health of not only the mother, but also the fetus as many medications can cross the placenta and reach the fetus. Some of the consequences on the babies include physical abnormalities, higher risk of stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and others. There is no established association with teratogenicity or elevated occurrence of birth defects and the usage of acetaminophen at any point during a pregnancy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) Ibuprofen and naproxen have not frequently been studied during pregnancy, but recent studies do not show increased risk of spontaneous abortion within the first six weeks of pregnancy. Between the lack of studies of the effect of ibuprofen and naproxen on pregnancy, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid these medications or use them sparingly per physician recommendations. Similarly, children exposed to lamotrigine or phenytoin in the womb do not seem to differ in their skills compared to those who were exposed to carbamazepine. Antacids Heartburn is a common symptom of late term pregnancy during which up to 80% of pregnant women have experienced it by the end of their third trimester. Aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate, when consumed, do not cross the placenta and are regarded as safe pharmacological options to treat heartburn, since there are no significant association with maldevelopment or injury to fetus. Pregnancy increases the risk of clot formation in women due to elevated levels of certain clotting factors and compounds in the body, and the risk increases even more immediately after birth and remains elevated up to 3 months after delivery. In pregnant women, warfarin is contraindicated and should be avoided as it crosses the placental barrier. UFH is classified as Pregnancy Category C, which means animal studies have shown potential for adverse effects to the fetus; however, there needs to be more studies done to confirm the presence of a risk to the fetus.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

SDN and its homologues exist widely in human, mammal, and some other animal brains, including: the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) in humans; ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (MPOA/AH) in sheep; sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in rats; anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc) in macaques; specific area in medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in quails; etc. Sexually dimorphic nucleus in medial preoptic area Formation and organization of SDN in medial preoptic area Sex differences in SDN caused by exposure to testosterone (prenatal) The volume of SDN in medial preoptic area is modified by hormones, among which testosterone is proved to be of much importance. Also, there is evidence that testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc. Role of SDN in controlling of male sexual behaviors Male sexual behaviors can be divided into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromatization of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM. Appetitive behaviors are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments showed that the level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. Role of SDN in sexual partner preference Role of SDN in male partner preference Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep demonstrate that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) have been found to have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams. Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN. For example, INAH3 in humans (homologue of oSDN) is significantly larger in heterosexual men than in homosexual men. Damage of SDN and changes in sexual partner preferences in males Bilateral damage to SDN in the medial preoptic area in male ferrets causes the change of males from male-typical preference to female-typical preference. Role of SDN in female partner preference Although SDN is much related to sexual partner preferences in males, it does not show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite for the expression of male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners\n\nThe biologic, social, and cognitive changes during adolescence place a focus on sexuality.In contrastif these behaviors occur as a consistent and persistent pattern ofnearly exclusive interest in behaviors typical of the gender roleopposite that of the child’s anatomic sex, referral for evaluationfor gender identity disorder (GID) would be appropriate.If a child this age is engaging in cross sex gender role behaviors, parents may be concerned about teasing and the possibilityof their child having a homosexual sexual orientation.

The biologic, social, and cognitive changes during adolescence place a focus on sexuality.Almost half of high school students report that they have had sexual intercourse.Ten to 25% have at least one homosexual experience, with this behavior being reported more commonly by boys than girls.Although many adolescents have sexual experiences with a same-sex partner, only a few have a homosexual sexual orientation by late adolescence. Vincent was known for his muscular body and hyper-masculine demeanor. He was also known for talking dirty and for saying harsh and degrading things to the men with whom he had sex in his films. \"He was frequently rough with his co-stars, and was even known to put his fist through a wall during an argument with a director.

Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) have been found to have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams. Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN. For example, INAH3 in humans (homologue of oSDN) is significantly larger in heterosexual men than in homosexual men.

According to Freud, the correct order of psychosexual development is as follows: oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital phases. If this stage is not successfully resolved, Freud believed that individuals may develop oral fixations in later life, leading to behaviors such as nail-biting or smoking. Freud proposed that unresolved conflicts during this stage could result in either anal retentive behaviors (excessive cleanliness and perfectionism) or anal expulsive behaviors (messiness and impulsiveness) in adulthood. Next comes the phallic stage, which takes place between the ages of 3 and 6 years. This stage is characterized by increased focus on the genitals, as children become interested in exploring their own bodies and notice differences between genders. According to Freud, during this stage, children develop unconscious sexual desires towards the parent of the opposite sex, known as the Oedipus or Electra complex. Following the phallic stage, there is a period known as the latent phase. During this stage, which generally occurs from around 6 to 12 years, sexual impulses are repressed, and children focus more on social and intellectual pursuits. Freud believed that the latent phase serves as a time of psychological rest and consolidation, as children develop skills and engage in non-sexual activities such as friendships and hobbies. Freud viewed successful resolution of previous stages as crucial for healthy development during this phase, allowing individuals to form intimate and fulfilling relationships. It is important to note that although Freud's theory of psychosexual development has had a significant influence on psychology and psychiatry, other theorists and researchers have presented different perspectives on human development. ; Naive/Inadequate – Often mentally disabled in some way, finds children less threatening.

There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship. It is important to practice emotional intimacy in relationships. A lack of emotional intimacy could be solved by taking the time to be with your partner throughout the duration of your relationships. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy. Romantic love in humans is associated with a variety of physiological and behavioral traits. Different parts of the brain also play important roles in the perception of romantic love. On the other hand, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when someone who is deeply in love experiences rejection from their partner. From a psychological standpoint, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach rather than just an emotional experience. One popular theory is Sternberg's triangular theory of love, which suggests that love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. Initially, partners may be attracted to each other based on sex appeal, which can then lead to the development of intimacy and bonding in a loving relationship. In summary, romantic love in humans is characterized by activation of specific brain areas involved in motivation and goal-oriented behavior. It is associated with components such as intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment, which contribute to the overall experience of romantic love. In the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment.Paternal inheritance was effective in preventing the depletion of farmland.

While there is only one direct reference to abortion as a procedure in the Christian Bible, certain passages have been interpreted by some Christians to suggest that abortion is morally unacceptable. Early Christians had differing beliefs about abortion, with some condemning it as a grave sin at any stage of pregnancy, while others did not view it as homicide until the fetus was \"formed\" and animated by a human soul. However, it's important to note that interpretations and attitudes towards abortion within Christianity have evolved over time. Some denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church and many conservative Protestant denominations, strongly oppose abortion and consider it morally wrong. Overall, Christianity's stance on abortion varies among different denominations and individual believers based on their interpretation of scripture and ethical considerations. Please note that this response provides an overview without endorsing or promoting any specific viewpoint or belief system surrounding Christianity and its stance on abortion. Many, and in some Western countries most, Catholics hold views on abortion that differ from the official position of the Catholic Church, which opposes abortion and its legality. Through most of its history the Catholic Church was divided on whether it believed that early abortion was murder, and it did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century. However, abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high Islamic faith such as the Middle East and North Africa. However, conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder.
