Some of you are very familiar with it. It's abbreviated HbA1c. It's called hemoglobin A1c, glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin. They do an HbA1c, and you get a 90-day view or a 3-month overview of what blood sugar has been running. The basics of the test, if I were to explain this in various, over-simplistic terms, they're looking at red blood cells, and they're looking at what percentage of the red blood cells are basically sugarcoated. Think of taking a red blood cell and dipping it in sugar and now it looks like a glazed donut, so to speak, but it's a red blood cell. A normal number is going to be below 5.7, 5.7%. Less than that 5.6 or down to probably closer to 4, that's a normal range for that. Once you get closer to 6%, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.5, you're at really high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Once you get above 6.5, you basically got type 2 diabetes. That's just how it works, and an uncontrolled type 2 diabetic can be at 7-1/2 or 8-1/2. I've seen them 9-1/2 or 10. Now you understand a little bit about the hemoglobin A1c test, what it actually looks for. They got torn up by the spleen. You make a new one in its place, and they get replaced. Knowing that, let's now talk about what they found in this study. They also looked at that. The A1c numbers were basically stable in that person. That's the way it should be done. That's what it comes down to. If they're not converting that into something useful, you can still have this issue. On the flip side of that, when you look at a hemoglobin A1c, also look at their triglycerides, look at their fasting blood sugar, not the best reading. That one's pretty variable. Look at their hemoglobin A1c. That's just going to mess things up even further, and you can be chasing. I'm also a huge fan of understanding the numbers properly, making sure you don't over-diagnose patients or misdiagnose patients. If you're a 7 and you don't feel right, maybe you need to be a 10. If you're at 7 and your A1c numbers haven't gotten better, maybe you need to be a 10 or 11 or 12 to feel normal for your body. That's a normal range. It doesn't mean that any number within that range is perfect for any patient. That means that if you're in the range, you may need to fiddle with it or you might not, but if you're outside that range, there's likely a problem. Don't misunderstand the range.
