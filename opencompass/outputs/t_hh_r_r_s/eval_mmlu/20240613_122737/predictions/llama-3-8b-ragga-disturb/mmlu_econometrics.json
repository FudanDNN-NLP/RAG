The significance of a 95% confidence interval lies in its ability to provide an estimated range within which the true population parameter is expected to occur. A 95% confidence interval implies that if the study were to be repeated multiple times within the same sample population, the confidence interval estimates would contain the true population parameter 95% of the time. A 95% confidence interval indicates that the probability of observing the true value outside of this range is less than 0.05. Therefore, there is a 5% chance of observing a value that does not represent the true parameter. It is important to note that a 95% confidence interval does not imply a 95% probability that the true parameter falls within the specific range calculated in a single study. This reflected a probability of 1 in 20 that the null hypothesis (no effect or no difference) was rejected based on the results from the study sample. Power represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a true treatment effect or difference between observed groups. In summary, a 95% confidence interval provides an estimated range within which the true population parameter is expected to occur. A tolerance interval is a statistical interval within which, with some confidence level, a specified proportion of a sampled population falls. \"More specifically, a 100×p%/100×(1−α) tolerance interval provides limits within which at least a certain proportion (p) of the population falls with a given level of confidence (1−α).\" \"A (p, 1−α) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion p of the sampled population with confidence 1−α; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content − (1−α) coverage TI.\" A tolerance interval can be seen as a statistical version of a probability interval. \"In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% prediction interval are the same.\" \"As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal.\" In other words, the probability of observing the true value outside of this range is less than 0.05.A 95% confidence interval implies that if the study were to be repeated within the same sample population numerous times, the confidence interval estimates would contain the true population parameter 95% of the time.Historically in the medical literature, a p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Confidence Intervals Confidence intervals (CI) provide the investigator an estimated range in which the true statistical measure (e.g., mean, proportion, and relative risk) is expected to occur. A 95% confidence interval implies that if the study were to be repeated within the same sample population numerous times, the confidence interval estimates would contain the true population parameter 95% of the time. In other words, the probability of observing the true value outside of this range is less than 0.05.Meta-analysis One way of improving precision of the effect measure and narrowing the confidence interval is to perform a meta-analysis in which treatment effects from several clinical trials are aggregated to provide a summary measure.Meta-analysis is a favorite tool of the Cochrane database, with which clinicians should be familiar (8). It provides a range of plausible values within which the true parameter value is likely to fall. In the case of a 95% confidence interval, it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process multiple times, approximately 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter. The statement that a 95% confidence interval will cover 2 standard errors around the mean is correct. It represents the average amount of error we would expect if we were to repeatedly sample from the same population.

When using logit or probit techniques with binary dependent variables, it is important to understand that these models estimate the probability of an event occurring. The coefficients in these models represent the change in the log-odds or the change in the standard normal cumulative distribution function, respectively, associated with a unit change in the independent variable. The issue with comparing these coefficients between nested models arises because the scales of the logit and probit coefficients are not the same, even though they represent similar concepts (i.e., the effects of the independent variables on the probability of the event). Therefore, direct comparisons of these coefficients can be misleading. One approach is to use Linear Probability Models, which estimate the effects of the independent variables on the probability directly, rather than on the log-odds or standard normal cumulative distribution function. This method involves standardizing the coefficients and comparing the standardized coefficients instead. Lastly, another useful approach is to examine marginal effects. Marginal effects provide the change in the probability of the event given a unit change in the independent variable, taking into account the values of the other variables in the model. In summary, comparing logit and probit coefficients between nested models can be problematic due to differences in scale. Using alternative methods such as Linear Probability Models, Y-standardization, the Karlson/Holm/Breen method, or examining marginal effects can help overcome these challenges and provide more reliable interpretations of the effects of variables on binary dependent variables. The advantage of using the best linear inverse probability weighted estimator for two-phase designs and missing covariate regression, compared to other estimators, is that it provides both efficiency and robustness against model misspecification. While likelihood-based estimators may be more efficient, they are more sensitive to model misspecification. In contrast, inverse probability weighted estimators, including the proposed best linear estimator, are more robust against model misspecification. The proposed best linear inverse probability weighted estimator takes advantage of the association between the outcome variable and the available covariates, which is captured by a working regression model. This working regression model allows for the projection of the inverse probability weighted estimator onto the orthogonal complement of the score space. It has been derived an asymptotic distribution and its finite sample performance has been examined through extensive simulation studies. In summary, the advantage of using the best linear inverse probability weighted estimator for two-phase designs and missing covariate regression is its efficiency gain through the use of the working regression model and its robustness against model misspecification.

In statistical analysis, the confidence limit is usually expressed as a range around the estimated mean.

The confidence limit provides a range within which we can be reasonably confident that the true value of the population parameter lies. For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis ) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).

Within-subject analysis indicated that changes in BMD were significantly associated with changes in sPINP (p = 0.022), but not with changes in sICTP (p = 0.84). However, neither sPINP nor sICTP was sufficiently sensitive to predict the rate of change in BMD for a group of individuals or for an individual. Second, is there a relationship between baseline measurements of bone turnover markers and change in BMD after controlling for unmeasured factors? These \"unmeasured factors\" were modeled by including a term for year, along with random factor terms for individual. Briefly, DOES is a longitudinal, population-based study of risk factors for fracture and mortality. The coefficient of reliability of BMD in our institution in normal subjects is 0.96, and the coefficient of variation was 1.5% at the proximal femur . Quality control was performed regularly by using phantom to ensure the reliability of the densitometer. The primary dependent (outcome) variable used in this study was change in femoral neck BMD. To take full advantage of the hierarchical structure and longitudinal nature of the study, a mixed-effects linear model was considered. Various mixed-effects models containing both fixed and random effects and adjusted for the within-subject correlation were considered. Details of these statistical models are shown in the Appendix. Briefly, the analysis began with the estimation of the baseline value and rate of change in BMD for each individual, assuming a linear function of time. The baseline value here refers to the intercept of an individual . The collection of the rates of change across individuals was assumed to be normally distributed with a mean β and variance σ β 2 MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatCvAUfKttLearuWrP9MDH5MBPbIqV92AaeXatLxBI9gBaebbnrfifHhDYfgasaacH8akY=wiFfYdH8Gipec8Eeeu0xXdbba9frFj0=OqFfea0dXdd9vqai=hGuQ8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qiLsFr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacaGaaeqabaqabeGadaaakeaaiiGacqWFdpWCdaqhaaWcbaGae8NSdigabaGaeGOmaidaaaaa@3131@ . To address the second question (i.e., association between baseline bone turnover markers and subsequent changes in BMD), the individual intercepts and slopes of the outcome-time model were modeled as a linear function of baseline measurements of PINP and ICTP. In this model, the difference in BMD between visit 3 and visit 2 (BMD 3-2) was modeled as a linear function of the difference in PINP (or ICTP) between visit 2 and visit 1 (PINP 2-1 or ICTP 2-1) such that BMD 3-2 = α + β (PINP 2-1) + γ (ICTP 2-1) + e, where e is the residual error term, and α, β and γ are regression coefficients to be estimated from\n\n Let is a random term.

Then, they use the estimated variance-covariance matrices to calculate the cross-market correlation coefficients (and their asymptotic distributions) for each set of markets and periods.

To disentangle contagion from interaction effects, county-specific variables have to be used to instrument foreign returns. Choosing the crisis \n\n introduces sample selection bias, and it has to be assumed that crisis periods are sufficiently long to allow correlations to be reliably estimated. In consequence, there appears to be no strong consensus in the empirical literature as to whether contagion occurs between markets, or how strong it is. The financial and economic literature presents ample evidence that in time of crisis co-movements between the returns of assets increase.

        "context": "Various mixed-effects models were used to assess the association between the markers and changes in BMD. Within-subject analysis indicated that changes in BMD were significantly associated with changes in sPINP (p = 0.022), but not with changes in sICTP (p = 0.84). However, neither sPINP nor sICTP was sufficiently sensitive to predict the rate of change in BMD for a group of individuals or for an individual. Second, is there a relationship between baseline measurements of bone turnover markers and change in BMD after controlling for unmeasured factors? These \"unmeasured factors\" were modeled by including a term for year, along with random factor terms for individual. Briefly, DOES is a longitudinal, population-based study of risk factors for fracture and mortality. The coefficient of reliability of BMD in our institution in normal subjects is 0.96, and the coefficient of variation was 1.5% at the proximal femur . Quality control was performed regularly by using phantom to ensure the reliability of the densitometer. The primary dependent (outcome) variable used in this study was change in femoral neck BMD. To take full advantage of the hierarchical structure and longitudinal nature of the study, a mixed-effects linear model was considered. Various mixed-effects models containing both fixed and random effects and adjusted for the within-subject correlation were considered. Details of these statistical models are shown in the Appendix. Briefly, the analysis began with the estimation of the baseline value and rate of change in BMD for each individual, assuming a linear function of time. The baseline value here refers to the intercept of an individual . The collection of the rates of change across individuals was assumed to be normally distributed with a mean β and variance σ β 2 MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatCvAUfKttLearuWrP9MDH5MBPbIqV92AaeXatLxBI9gBaebbnrfifHhDYfgasaacH8akY=wiFfYdH8Gipec8Eeeu0xXdbba9frFj0=OqFfea0dXdd9vqai=hGuQ8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qiLsFr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacaGaaeqabaqabeGadaaakeaaiiGacqWFdpWCdaqhaaWcbaGae8NSdigabaGaeGOmaidaaaaa@3131@ . To address the second question (i.e., association between baseline bone turnover markers and subsequent changes in BMD), the individual intercepts and slopes of the outcome-time model were modeled as a linear function of baseline measurements of PINP and ICTP. In this model, the difference in BMD between visit 3 and visit 2 (BMD 3-2) was modeled as a linear function of the difference in PINP (or ICTP) between visit 2 and visit 1 (PINP 2-1 or ICTP 2-1) such that BMD 3-2 = α + β (PINP 2-1) + γ (ICTP 2-1) + e, where e is the residual error term, and α, β and γ are regression coefficients to be estimated from\n\n Let is a random term. They first estimated the variance-covariance matrices for each pair of countries during the stable period, turmoil period, and full period. Then, they use the estimated variance-covariance matrices to calculate the cross-market correlation coefficients (and their asymptotic distributions) for each set of markets and periods. As Pesaran and Pick (2007) observe, however, financial contagion is a difficult system to estimate econometrically. To disentangle contagion from interaction effects, county-specific variables have to be used to instrument foreign returns. Choosing the crisis \n\n introduces sample selection bias, and it has to be assumed that crisis periods are sufficiently long to allow correlations to be reliably estimated. In consequence, there appears to be no strong consensus in the empirical literature as to whether contagion occurs between markets, or how strong it is. The financial and economic literature presents ample evidence that in time of crisis co-movements between the returns of assets increase. This increase in correlation between the returns of the loans' collateral causes an increase in the volatility of bank assets and, therefore an increase in the value of the bank's stock and its cost of \n\n Conventional wisdom on stop losses set the risk per trade anywhere between 1%-5% of capital for a single trade; this risk varies from one trader to another.

It synthesised data generated from a randomised controlled trial (screening uptake) and from the literature. The impact of the parameter uncertainty was assessed in a range of sensitivity analyses. The conclusion held with high certainty across the range of ceiling ratios from zero to €100,000 per QALY and across a plausible range of input parameters. The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00125-015-3824-0) contains peer-reviewed but unedited supplementary material, which is available to authorised users. While international GDM prevalence estimates vary considerably, partly due to differences in diagnostic criteria , it is widely recognised that GDM prevalence is rising worldwide [1, 8], leading to increasing pressures being placed on already constrained healthcare budgets. A number of economic evaluations based on decision modelling techniques have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies, in jurisdictions including the USA, UK, India and Israel [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Despite modest expected average effects on delivery outcomes , the relatively low cost of screening and subsequent treatment provides for favourable incremental cost-effectiveness of these screening strategies given treatment compliance after diagnosis. No national GDM screening programme is currently in operation, and existing practice may be best characterised as opportunistic in nature. We undertook an economic evaluation of screening for GDM in Ireland based on a decision analytical model. In the decision model, alternative screening strategies assumed different uptake rates, which consequently led to different proportions of GDM cases being detected and treated. In terms of costs, the model estimated those relating to GDM screening, GDM treatment and the management of adverse outcomes. In terms of effectiveness, the model estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Uncertainty in cost per QALY estimate was examined in the model using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case analysis, the alternative screening strategies were modelled on the uptake rates observed in the randomised controlled trial . Other scenarios were assessed in one- and two-way sensitivity analyses, varying uptake rates and other key parameters across their plausible ranges. For the economic evaluation, we followed the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) guidelines for the Republic of Ireland . These informed the adoption of the healthcare perspective (publicly funded system) with respect to costing (in 2013 euro prices), the cost–utility analysis framework for evaluation (QALY as the measure of effect), and the use of a 5% discount rate in the base case. Screening was based on a 75 g OGTT assumed to have 100% sensitivity and specificity, as this is the reference test . The evaluation was based on the analytical decision-tree model built for this study (Fig. The model structure was informed by similar models from other settings [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and by observational data from the large-scale ATLANTIC DIP study conducted in the west of Ireland on the risks of maternal, neonatal and perinatal outcomes associated with GDM in the Irish context.
