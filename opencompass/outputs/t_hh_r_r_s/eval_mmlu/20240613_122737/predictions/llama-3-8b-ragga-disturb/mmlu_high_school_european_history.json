In contrast, all other molecules, including water, are said to be inorganic. Certain combinations of atoms, such as the methyl (–CH3), hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl (–COOH), carbonyl (–C=O), phosphate (–PO32–), sulfhydryl (–SH), and amino (–NH2) groups, occur repeatedly in the molecules made by cells. Each such chemical group has distinct chemical and physical properties that influence the behavior of the molecule in which the group occurs.

They are usually found free in solution and have many different fates. Some are used as monomer subunits to construct giant polymeric macromolecules— proteins, nucleic acids, and large polysaccharides.

These microorganisms, such as bacteria, algae, and protozoa, play a vital role in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter and pollutants. By promoting aerobic conditions, the oxidation pond helps in reducing the concentrations of organic pollutants, including organic nitrogen and carbon compounds. Regarding the nitrogen cycle specifically, certain microorganisms are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen gas (N2) into a form that can be utilized by living organisms. Nitrogen fixation is mainly carried out by bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen gas into ammonia or nitrate ions through biological processes like symbiotic associations with plants or free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Once fixed, nitrogen becomes available to other organisms for growth and development. Some microorganisms also play a role in denitrification, which converts nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen gas, completing the nitrogen cycle. Their ability to decompose organic matter and fix atmospheric nitrogen ensures a continuous supply of essential nutrients for various life forms in ecosystems.

Life-changing technological discoveries allowed ordinary people to face religion with a new morality and greater confidence about humankind and its abilities. New philosophical, social, and political ideas appeared. Some thinkers rejected theism outright and various currents were formed; atheism, deism, and hostility to organized religion.

Reiss' theory of the psychology of religious experiences provides a link between personality, motivation and the often contradictory teachings and practices of the world's religions. Unlike previous theories that posit a single source and essence of religion such as fear of death, mysticism, sacredness, communal bonding, magic, or peak experiences, Reiss presented detailed support for his theory that religion is about the values motivated by the sixteen basic desires of human nature. In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss develops the theory that people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, a person with a weak basic desire for social contact might be attracted to religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for social contact might be attracted to religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for vengeance might be attracted to passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for vengeance might be attracted to passages that speak of revenge.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) proposes a \"maker intellect\" which enables thinking by making things intelligible, much like light allows seeing by making things visible. Plotinus (d. 270), whose works were well known in the Islamic world, proposed that human beings gained knowledge through their relation to a divine intellect. Muslim philosophers Al-Farabi (d. 951) and Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina, d. 1037) further develop this theory and call it the \"agent intellect\", which gives forms to matter and facilitates human knowledge. Avempace (also known as Ibn Bajja, d. 1138) proposed a theory of the intellect that was to influence Averroes's theory, but, according \n\n During the Enlightenment, humanistic ideas resurfaced, this time further from religion and classical literature. Science, reason, and intellectualism advanced, and the mind replaced God as the means with which to understand the world. Divinity was no longer dictating human morals, and humanistic values such tolerance and opposition to slavery started to take shape. Life-changing technological discoveries allowed ordinary people to face religion with a new morality and greater confidence about humankind and its abilities. New philosophical, social, and political ideas appeared. Some thinkers rejected theism outright and various currents were formed; atheism, deism, and hostility to organized religion. Notably during the Enlightenment, Baruch Spinoza redefined God as signifying the totality of nature; Spinoza was accused of atheism but remained silent on the matter. Naturalism was also advanced by prominent \n\nSteven Reiss (1947–2016) was an American psychologist who contributed original ideas, new assessment methods, and influential research studies to four topics in psychology: anxiety disorders, developmental disabilities, intrinsic motivation, and the psychology of religion. Biography\nHe was born in New York City in 1947 and was educated at Dartmouth College, Yale University, and Harvard University. Although his efforts were concentrated on dual diagnosis, he also served on official classification and terminology committees, advocated nationally to lessen discrimination for organ transplant operations, and helped build the Human Development Institute in Chicago. He received the 2008 Distinguished Research Award from the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), the 2006 Frank J. Menolascino Award for Career Research from the National Association on Dual Diagnosis, the 1991 Distinguished Award for Career Research from the Arc of the United States, and the 1987 Distinguished Services Award from AAIDD. Reiss and his colleagues executed the first large-scale, cross-cultural, scientific research surveys of what people say motivates them. More than 6,000 people from four continents were assessed. Reiss created an international network of seven training institutes located in Europe and Asia to train business consultants in his methods of life coaching. In 2000 and 2004 Reiss first presented his scientific theory of what motivates religious experiences and practices. This theory holds that all religious experiences express one or more of the 16 basic desires. He exposed flaws in the underlying science and the failure to consider contradictory data.

There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. We're dealing with, in no particular order: a fever, mucositis which causes him to drool instead of swallow, some intermittent nausea, and a whopper of a rash. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. Henry misses Anna and Sophie, so we added these to their room so that we can talk to them during the day. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! Amazingly,\n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. Many of the systems will not allow you to use a password you have ever used on that system before. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate.

Many of us, however, also abide by the rule that “if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.” So what should we make of the patient who presents with what looks and sounds like croup, but it is recurrent? We have dealt with the common issue of Croup previously. Some or no response to standard therapy for croup. Look for hemangiomas on the child’s face, particularly the beard distribution. Not everything works as planned… but listening to the timing of the stridor can help point toward potential cause. Subglottic stenosis or vocal cord paralysis are examples. If you are taking care of a child who is presenting with what appears to be croup, but this marks the 3rd or greater occurrence of it, then you are dealing with Recurrent Croup. She has recurrent croup since birth. Is now having a bought. She was diagnosed with asthma at age 3. Cough-Variant asthma is another good example of how not every illness is just like it is depicted in the medical text books. My daughter is 11 years old and still gets recurrent croup requiring steroids, with many episodes each year. This post has been very helpful and informative. It is clear recurrent croup at 11 is not normal and time we got it investigated properly. Will ask our doctor to refer to an ENT specialist. We have seen countless Pulmonologist, GI, Pediatrics, Holistic medicine doctors yet he still experiences Croup on a monthly basis. We are in the same boat. Had adenoids and tonsils out but nothing has changed. Interesting as he (doctor)does not believe that ‘cough variant asthma’ exists. Just a term that evolved. Interesting read! She has seen an ENT who did a scope and said she has reflux. She wants my daughter to have a bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy at the hospital which is an outpatient procedure but she has to have anesthesia so I am putting it off because my husband and I are to nervous to have her under like that. Has anyone had their child have any of these procedures? As I note in the Morsel, “recurrent croup” really should make us think of other conditions that are not croup.

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\némile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nA nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Amphotericin is an anti-fungal medicine, of which I remember nothing from medical school except it's nickname, ampho-terrible, named due to it's uncomfortable side effects. There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. We're dealing with, in no particular order: a fever, mucositis which causes him to drool instead of swallow, some intermittent nausea, and a whopper of a rash. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. Henry misses Anna and Sophie, so we added these to their room so that we can talk to them during the day. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! Amazingly,\n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. Many of the systems will not allow you to use a password you have ever used on that system before. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it\n\n secret society of colliers, an English Camorra, which is capable of destroying both train and passengers? It is improbable, but it is not impossible. I confess that I am unable to suggest any other solution.

Many of us, however, also abide by the rule that “if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.” So what should we make of the patient who presents with what looks and sounds like croup, but it is recurrent? We have dealt with the common issue of Croup previously. Some or no response to standard therapy for croup. Look for hemangiomas on the child’s face, particularly the beard distribution. Not everything works as planned… but listening to the timing of the stridor can help point toward potential cause. Subglottic stenosis or vocal cord paralysis are examples. If you are taking care of a child who is presenting with what appears to be croup, but this marks the 3rd or greater occurrence of it, then you are dealing with Recurrent Croup. She has recurrent croup since birth. Is now having a bought. She was diagnosed with asthma at age 3. Cough-Variant asthma is another good example of how not every illness is just like it is depicted in the medical text books. My daughter is 11 years old and still gets recurrent croup requiring steroids, with many episodes each year. This post has been very helpful and informative. It is clear recurrent croup at 11 is not normal and time we got it investigated properly. Will ask our doctor to refer to an ENT specialist. We have seen countless Pulmonologist, GI, Pediatrics, Holistic medicine doctors yet he still experiences Croup on a monthly basis. We are in the same boat. Had adenoids and tonsils out but nothing has changed. Interesting as he (doctor)does not believe that ‘cough variant asthma’ exists. Just a term that evolved. Interesting read! She has seen an ENT who did a scope and said she has reflux. She wants my daughter to have a bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy at the hospital which is an outpatient procedure but she has to have anesthesia so I am putting it off because my husband and I are to nervous to have her under like that. Has anyone had their child have any of these procedures? As I note in the Morsel, “recurrent croup” really should make us think of other conditions that are not croup. Everytime had to be treated at the hospital. Have vicks on his chest / back / feet, given chinese herbal cough syrup Nim Jom a few times a night if it’s really bad, Advil on harsh nights, the cool mist humidifier is on max the last 5 weeks and very clean with colloidal silver added to the water, we do not have mold issues in the sills or his room, and he’s starting to look pale from crummy nights of waking up for two hours at a time and coughing incessantly.

Because food forms such an integral part of a nation or region’s identity, there are strong connections between geographic areas and types of food. This is why we associate pizza and spaghetti with Italy, cheese and pâté with France, paella with Spain, olives with Greece, and so on. So, what is the Mediterranean diet? Is it pizza, pâté, paella or olives? The main characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is an abundance of plant food (fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals, nuts, and legumes) with splashes of olive oil as the main source of fat. Add to this grilled fish and poultry and some red meat on occasion. This is, of course, enjoyed with small glasses of red wine. What benefits does the Mediterranean diet offer for a low cholesterol diet plan? If you’re looking to live longer with less disability and chronic disease, the Mediterranean diet might be right for you. Clinical trials have shown that adherence to the Mediterranean diet can lead to a significant improvement in health, specifically a significant reduction in heart disease and certain cancers. The key seems to be the olive oil that forms such an integral part of the Mediterranean diet. All this can be enjoyed with small glasses of red wine. A lot of the foods recommended for heart health such as nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado and even red wine are quite high in kilojoules, how do I include these into my diet without putting on weight? In fact, you could even gain a kilo or two! Olives and avocados are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. Research has shown that foods with a high monounsaturated fatty acid content lower “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase ‘good’ high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Try tahini (blended sesame seeds) and hummus as a dip or spread for bread and pass on the butter. Legumes include dry, cooked or canned beans, lentils, peas and all the soya products (cooked or canned soya beans, soya mince, cubes, milk, tofu and tempeh). Legumes have a high fibre content, are naturally low in fat and they don’t contain any cholesterol. Correct portions: ½ cup legumes provides about 15g carbohydrate (1 slice of bread). Add lentils to mince; add chickpeas to salads; make hummus as a dip for crudites; have beans on toast as breakfast or add split lentils to stews and casseroles. Rein in the red meat and rather substitute it with fish or poultry. Researchers have discovered that people who eat fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids three or more times a week are less likely to suffer from heart disease and high blood pressure. The best fish sources of omega-3 fatty acids are fatty fish such as salmon, fresh tuna, trout and sardines, although eating any type of unfried or unbuttered fish is also beneficial. Correct portions: When choosing fish, opt for tuna, salmon, trout, mackerel, pilchards and herring. When you do eat fish, chicken or red meat, keep your portions small (90-120 g or about the size of a deck of cards). If you don’t drink alcohol, you don’t need to start! 7) Spice up your life Instead of just using salt and pepper as seasoning, try including garlic, ginger, coriander, cinnamon, cumin and turmeric in your repertoire. These spices are proof that dynamite really does come in small packages. Not only do they add big flavour, but they add big nutritional value too while contributing almost zero kilojoules! Even those living in the Mediterranean are taking fewer siestas and are less likely to spend time preparing and enjoying food. Today we face a modern antithesis in food and lifestyle: fast versus slow; industrialisation of food versus fresh or organic ingredients; globalisation versus regionalisation; pre-packed versus fresh; super size versus balance; the list goes on. Most of us could certainly benefit from putting some of the principles of the Mediterranean diet into practice.

Read by Tabetha Moreto. In two thousand fifteen, there were thirty nine point seven deaths per one hundred thousand U.S. residents due to drugs, alcohol and suicide compared with twenty three point one in nineteen ninety nine — a whopping increase of seventy two percent. Researchers from the Berkeley Research Group examined deaths from 1999-2015 using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New Mexico had the highest rate of drug, alcohol and suicide-related deaths in two thousand fifteen: seventy seven point four per one hundred thousand residents. West Virginia was second with sixty seven point four deaths, though it saw the largest jump of all the states — more than three times the twenty two point one it was in nineteen ninety nine. That number could shoot up to twenty eight point four deaths per one hundred thousand residents by two thousand twenty five. In two thousand sixteen, forty four point seven million Americans eighteen or older experienced a mental health issue, more than twenty million over the age of twelve had a substance abuse disorder, and eight point two million adults experienced both. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s two thousand sixteen National Survey on Drug Use and Health, fewer than one in ten people with substance use disorders and less than half with mental health issues received recommended treatment. The discovery suggests that skin samples might be used to improve detection of the disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which now is usually diagnosed with much more difficult procedures, like brain biopsies or autopsies. The researchers said that despite the new findings, there is no reason to change the medical care given to patients with the disease or to people known to have genetic mutations that may predispose them to Creutzfeldt-Jakob or related illnesses. Practicing physicians and the public are “going to be a little bit shocked or taken aback by a diagnosis of Stage one hypertension with a blood pressure of one hundred thirty over eighty, which historically has been considered a normal, well-controlled blood pressure,” said Doctor William White, a professor in the cardiology center at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.

None of them came to ask for a change in their medication. In each case the change was recommended by a clinician in response to a new guideline against which our practice will be judged and financially rewarded or penalised. Increasingly, financial incentives are being used to ‘improve quality’ in healthcare, which usually means that payment depends on the proportion of patients with condition ‘a’, receiving treatment ‘z’. It says very little about Doreen, Ahmed or Henry. She lives alone, is socially anxious and isolated, frequently misses appointments, hates going to hospital, forgets to take her medication less often than she chooses not to take it – which is very often. Ahmed is 47, has had two heart attacks, has type 2 diabetes with complications affecting his eyesight and his kidneys, he is overweight and cannot exercise because of chronic gouty arthritis. He has high blood pressure and cares for his wife who has schizophrenia, doesn’t speak any English and is frequently admitted to hospital. Doreen, Ahmed and Henry are not the kinds of patients who are going to object when the doctor they know and trust, or even the expert they have never met before, changes their medication to include Atorvastatin 80mg. I have no desire to impose an unnecessary burden of treatment upon them. I have every desire to practice with wisdom and compassion, to understand what matters most to them, what they want to get out of their treatment, to know how much is enough and how much is too much, to know which risks are worth taking and which are not. It is almost impossible to answer these questions without time. They generalise and we attempt to contextualise. I am not sure that shared-decision making tools aren’t heading down a blind alley. They assume that people making decisions are rational and interested in abstractions like statistical tools and flow-charts, when the way my patients usually talk about healthcare is in personal narratives with significant events, characters, aspirations and moral negotiations. Compare Richard Lehman’s description of a shared decision making process or Paul Haidet’s description of a consultation with the NHS shared decision making website. Informed shared decision making restored my dignity, increased my autonomy, empowered choice and prepared me for change. I was emotionally vulnerable, significantly brain damaged from trauma and in unremitting pain. I will forever be grateful for the surgeon who took the time to share the best available evidence and consider my values. There was no ability to navigate abstractions or statistical tools, I could not see well then enough to read a flowchart. My narrative was likely not thoughtfully constructed, it was desperate and missing a coherent timeline because I could not remember my past and was too damaged to see my future. This is informed shared decision making and it can be done with words, pictures and tools. If you had bothered to seek out and use these methods before you dismissed them you would know this. Your self perceived knowledge of what shared decision making is and your ignorance of the deep compassion and understanding of the people working in this area takes my breath away. Shared decision making includes context, shared values and the understanding by both parties of the judicious use of evidence in medicine. You repeat concerns about too much pressure and too little time and make it look like shared decision making as practiced by those other than yourself is formula driven. Funny in the time of real decision-making and communication time stands still, people get real and there is no talk about too much pressure because the focus is on solving the problem to meet the need. ‘The job of the human being [in the digital age] is to become skilled at locating relevant valid data for their needs. In the sphere of medicine, the required skill is to be able to relate the knowledge generated by the study of groups of patients or populations to that lonely and anxious individual who has come to seek help’ (Sir Muir Gray, 2001). I think you probably need to read around JT’s blog a little more – he practices more shared decision making, compassionate care and concern for his patients in their whole lives (not just the acute encounter) than any other Dr I have come across. In fact, finding this blog was what gave me, as a person who had suddenly become very sick and dependent on doctors, faith that they might find ways to treat me as a human being – that I could be empowered and get outcomes that mattered to me rather than them. JT is absolutely in favour of shared decision making and listening to patients and finding what matters to them – he’s just not in favour of commoditising or tickboxifying it, and he recognises that most of the ‘tools’ for SDM around common conditions ignore the realities of many patients’ lives. I’m glad your surgeon did so well with and for you – it is absolutely how all doctors and nurses should practice and I’m confident that JTs patients get a similar level of respect and inclusion – just not by using an algorithm published by a quango far from the consulting room. There is no easy way we can assess thoughtful deliberation. Quantifying how we respond to guidelines like this seems objective, but it is scientism, not scientific. I hope you can “exception report” patients like these three, excluding them from your denominator, to avoid being financially penalised. What I need to know is how much people like Doreen and Ahmed are likely to benefit from Atorvastatin 80mg and then I’d need to know how much Doreen and Ahmed want to benefit from Atorvastatin\n\nPlease welcome guest blogger for today, Connie Roberts from Brain Foggles and My Chronic Life. After being diagnosed with a chronic illness and going through feeling shock, sadness and anger, I settled in with the belief that since I was dealt this hand in life no other medical condition could come my way. That was bad enough. Surely, that was enough for one person to deal with. This was something I had never heard of before. At that time the diagnosis was called “sicca” which means dryness of the mouth and eyes. I now have come to accept that I am indeed fortunate. Through my blogs I’ve received inquiries from people who believe they have Sjogren’s but because they don’t have the antibodies in their blood, a positive lip biopsy or positive tests from their Ophthalmologist, they live with the diagnosis of sicca or connective tissue disorder, or no diagnosis. Following is some information to help you become your own advocate if you have the symptoms of Sjogren’s. Sjogren’s is often broken up into Primary or Secondary. Primary means that you have Sjogrens without any other connective tissue disorder. There are many forms of support for people with Sjogren’s. Sandy has written a post about this previously. Sjogren’s Syndrome is getting recognized more frequently. I work for that but for now I also work for creating a knowledge base and support for people who are seeking answers. She is a Disability Advocate who uses her blogs to break stereotypes for people with all types of disabilities and chronic illnesses, especially invisible chronic illnesses. I also have a lot to share by the way of information, suggestions, from my own experiences and through my knowledge with Natural and Alternative treatments that can help people cope with their physical pain, as well as the emotional aspects of having this type of condition in a much healthier way than drugs. I’ve had so many overlapping symptoms for so long before I was able to get any clues as to what was wrong with me…Constant everyday aches and pains, bouts of digestive issues, eye irritation/dryness, awful flare ups of\n\n dead, The third cow he cleikit be the head.

Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it\n\nGraeme Milbourne Clark was born in Camden, NSW in 1935. He finished his secondary education as a boarder at Scots College in Sydney in 1951. Clark then went to the University of Sydney graduating with honours from an MB, BS degree (1957). Fresh from medical school, Dr Clark worked at the Royal Prince Alfred and North Shore Hospitals as a resident medical officer (1958-59) before specialising as a registrar in neurosurgery and otolaryngology (1961). Clark then left our sunny shores for England, where he worked as senior house surgeon at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital (1962) and senior registrar in otolaryngology at the Bristol General Hospital (1963). Clark returned to Australia and the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital as assistant and then senior ENT surgeon (1963-66). Not satisfied with the treatments available to profoundly deaf patients, Clark returned to the University of Sydney to embark on further study. During his studies, Clark also lectured in physiology at the University of Sydney and remained as senior honorary ENT surgeon at the Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne. In 1969, Clark accepted the William Gibson chair of otolaryngology at the University of Melbourne (1970-2004). Whilst professor of otolaryngology, Clark established the Cochlear Implant Clinic at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital and was the surgeon in charge (1985-2004). In 1984 Clark founded the Bionic Ear Institute and acted as its director until 2005. Clark was made laureate professor at the University of Melbourne in 1999, professor at the University of Wollongong in 2003 and distinguished professor at La Trobe University in 2008. He is now distinguished researcher at the ICT for Life Sciences. My name is Stephen O’Leary. I am the William Gibson Chair of Otolaryngology at the University of Melbourne. It is my very great pleasure to welcome Professor Graeme Clark, the first holder of this chair, back to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, to conduct an interview for the Australian Academy of Science. Childhood is an inspirational time, so what influences from your childhood developed your passion to help people today? My mother was very creative and she inspired me with art and music. My father was the pharmacist, the more pragmatic person, who quietly was influencing me as a potential doctor, I think. So they were strong influences. When you were a child, were you interested foremost in helping deaf people or were you more interested in how things worked? Yes, well, I must have been interested in how things worked. At the age of ten I was doing biological experiments in my mother’s laundry. Also, having read the life of Louis Pasteur, I wanted to emulate him in some ways. The tomatoes all seemed to have some disease, so I made a hypodermic syringe in my father’s chemist shop, and tried to transfer agents, like viruses, from one tomato plant to another. Boarding school was a very influential period as well. I was shy and I was sent away from home to a boarding school in the city. It took adjustment and it was very lonely for a while, but it was a very maturing experience. It was a school where you had to play sport, unless you had lost a leg or something like that. I had to be one of the boys by being reasonable at sport. I can remember playing rugby union at Scots College Sydney. Not being a solid boy, it was always a trauma to have to tackle charging boys. I remember one time I was in the under­13As on the back line. The house I was in had all the best players, some of whom represented the state later. So they put me, this under-13A boy, on the wing where I could not do much and occasionally score a try. On one occasion, the opposite house back, a burly young fellow, broke loose and came charging down at me and there was only me between him and the goal line. I’ll make it look like I’ve done a tackle.’ So I shut my eyes and I grasped the air and it just so happened that, at the moment I grasped the air, he jumped and I caught him around the ankles. They were the sorts of challenges that you had as a border. I will never forget how important summarising and logic were for me later in my career. The second person was Fred Pollock, who was a maths teacher. He trained at least four boys to top the state in maths. He gave us a basic understanding of the importance of maths. We had another one, Hoey Simmons, a doctor of philosophy, who had actually made a small contribution to the periodic table, and he was a very inspiring chemistry teacher. I don’t think we realise the important influence that teachers at that level have on us and on our lives. I came to realise how difficult it was for him as a pharmacist in the small country town of Camden. I was embarrassed, and I decided then that I would like to do medicine, and to be an ear, nose and throat doctor. That was the first desire to be an ear doctor. I did switch my desires during the course and wanted to be a cardiac physician and then a general surgeon, but I am glad that I returned to ear, nose and throat surgery. When our local Methodist minister asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I was reported to have said that I wanted to be an ear doctor. That floored him, because boys of my age all wanted to be C-class steam train drivers. That was the very macho thing to do. So it was from an early age, and I think it was Dad’s influence as well. I was offered an opportunity to do a bachelor of medical science degree, which I turned down, because at that stage I wanted to be a clinical doctor and then to turn around and do research. Different circumstances, in a way. Firstly, I wanted to be a cardiologist for personal reasons and for the fact that, at that stage, our thinking was that physicians were the ‘thinking doctors’ and surgeons were the ‘doing doctors’.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.\nSource 1\nIndians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Doreen, Ahmed and Henry have recently had their medication changed in response to a new guideline for prescribing Statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs. None of them came to ask for a change in their medication. In each case the change was recommended by a clinician in response to a new guideline against which our practice will be judged and financially rewarded or penalised. Increasingly, financial incentives are being used to ‘improve quality’ in healthcare, which usually means that payment depends on the proportion of patients with condition ‘a’, receiving treatment ‘z’. It says very little about Doreen, Ahmed or Henry. She lives alone, is socially anxious and isolated, frequently misses appointments, hates going to hospital, forgets to take her medication less often than she chooses not to take it – which is very often. Ahmed is 47, has had two heart attacks, has type 2 diabetes with complications affecting his eyesight and his kidneys, he is overweight and cannot exercise because of chronic gouty arthritis. He has high blood pressure and cares for his wife who has schizophrenia, doesn’t speak any English and is frequently admitted to hospital. Doreen, Ahmed and Henry are not the kinds of patients who are going to object when the doctor they know and trust, or even the expert they have never met before, changes their medication to include Atorvastatin 80mg. I have no desire to impose an unnecessary burden of treatment upon them. I have every desire to practice with wisdom and compassion, to understand what matters most to them, what they want to get out of their treatment, to know how much is enough and how much is too much, to know which risks are worth taking and which are not. It is almost impossible to answer these questions without time. They generalise and we attempt to contextualise. I am not sure that shared-decision making tools aren’t heading down a blind alley. They assume that people making decisions are rational and interested in abstractions like statistical tools and flow-charts, when the way my patients usually talk about healthcare is in personal narratives with significant events, characters, aspirations and moral negotiations. Compare Richard Lehman’s description of a shared decision making process or Paul Haidet’s description of a consultation with the NHS shared decision making website. Informed shared decision making restored my dignity, increased my autonomy, empowered choice and prepared me for change. I was emotionally vulnerable, significantly brain damaged from trauma and in unremitting pain.

It’s basically a genetic therapy, in the sense that the treatment is designed to address a particular genetic situation. In theory. But if we do the MRI and it shows too much continued growth, even if it’s a reduced rate of growth, then she will no longer qualify for the study. Some growth is acceptable under the study protocols, but too much—even if it’s less than would have been the case without the drug—is not. Rebecca is part of the first p28 study ever done in children. One of those two would mean exiting the study even though there was some benefit, simply because there wasn’t enough benefit. Or she could have too much growth and be disqualified. Do you find out what’s happening sooner, even though it could mean you hasten her death, when not finding out might have meant she’d live longer? The choice is real enough, but the implied promise—that the right choice, if you can somehow manage to find or luck into it, will lead to a cure—may be, almost certainly is, an illusion. I can’t even take refuge in not choosing, since that is the same as choosing to scan later instead of sooner.

What motivated you to become a researcher? This was a malaria prone area with a lot of STIs too. You were sure when on call to be paged for an emergency ruptured ectopic gestation or a child with severe anemia after malaria infection. If positive, you discarded it. After many nights responding to obstructed labor and ruptured ectopic gestation, Obgyn became a natural next step for me. I wanted to make a difference in STIs in general, particularly HIV, and specifically I wanted to influence women’s health. We had previously worked in Nairobi but we made a strategic move to relocate our work to the then Nyanza region of Kenya which was the heart of the Kenyan epidemic then. After our initial two small clinics, one in Nairobi and another in Kisumu, we expanded HIV care to the South Nyanza region, which had the highest HIV prevalence in Nyanza where infrastructure was not as well developed and people desperately needed access to critical care. It has been a great opportunity to make an impact on the lives of many people; not only on the patients, many of whom know they would not be alive today if care had not reached them, but also on the many health care workers we have had the opportunity to work with over the years. I want to particularly pay tribute to Joan Kriess who saw, not what I was, but what I could be, and to King Holmes, who patiently and carefully taught me how to not only work towards being a good researcher, but how to always try to bring out the best in everybody. Craig, much like King, has been the person with great ideas, while I have been the more earth-bound practical and pragmatic person who works through the kinks to make it work, and it has been a very good experience. Mentoring has been one of the highlights of research for me. I only have so much I can understand and I have only 24 hours in a day. I only need to nudge them in the direction of their dreams, provide a platform for support and watch them soar. I think unless people know their status it is very difficult for them to make decisions that can impact their lives positively. Particularly in Kenya, how do we help young women reduce their risk of getting infected? As a gynecologist, it cannot escape my deep concern that the face of HIV remains a young African woman for SSA. Elimination of pediatric HIV remains a challenge because so long as we have women of reproductive age getting infected we continue to struggle for an HIV-free generation in Africa. What is a challenging ethical dilemma you’ve encountered? There have been many challenging ethical opportunities, but perhaps one that stands out for me is from my early days in research when an HIV positive woman was not willing to disclose her status to her husband. We cannot afford to ignore any issue that is of global health concern in the connected world we live in. We have the momentum from the biomedical research side to really make a difference, but we need to push for the political and economic will to follow through.

She was Director of Student Health at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for sixteen years and served as the clinical administrator and medical consultant for an AIDS research project in conjunction with the Boston University School of Medicine and the Kushi Foundation. That research project studied the effects of macrobiotics as an alternative and adjunctive therapy for AIDS. She is co-author, with Michio Kushi, of AIDS, Macrobiotics, and Natural Immunity (Japan Publications, 1990) and contributed to Doctors Look at Macrobiotics (Japan Publications, 1988). Dr. Cottrell, much in demand as a lecturer and teacher, shared some of her thoughts with MBT on women’s health, her style of medical practice, social attitudes on nurturing children, along with a few comments on the writings of George Ohsawa during the 1991 Fall Health Classic in Palm Springs, California. BL: I thought that we might explore several areas. Another is your background and evolution from a medical doctor to a preventive medicine/macrobiotic practitioner. And another is your method and style of treatment as a health care practitioner, plus anything else you would like to share. MC: That covers a lot of ground. Nature, in its infinite wisdom, requires that higher-order species have a long period of nurturing from infancy to maturity. The female does most of this nurturing. The whole structure in both the animal kingdom and particularly in our human species acknowledges the fact that the female needs to be protected as well as the young so that nurturing can take place until the next generation can get along on its own. But it’s the female that has the long gestational period and also has the long period for the nurturing and development of the human species. What I see happening in our society which concerns me so much is that women are so ill. We are seeing epidemic forms of disease among our women that have not been so prevalent before. But we’re not looking at the graver and larger picture, which is the deterioration of our health and destruction of our society. What I’m seeing, from a wholistic perspective, is that we, as women, have left a place in society that was not working really, and now with the women’s movement, we’ve come to a place where we have many more options for self-realization. In so doing, we are destroying the opportunity for continuation of the species. Traditionally, the female has been the one that has received the fertilization, given birth, and nurtured the next generation. We are giving over this power that is female to technology. What is this female energy? BL: How do you see that expressed in the patients that you see? When they have physical conditions, do they also have emotional and psychological concerns? We tend to think we can separate mind, body, spirit, and emotions. As health practitioners, we have to help patients to understand the metaphor of their illness, the language of the illness, in order for them to heal. What I see is that the form of the illness can tell us, and the individual, a lot about the areas that need to be worked upon. BL: Why do people come to see you in particular? MC: Well, you have to realize that by virtue of who I am, I’m going to attract certain kinds of patients. Just the fact that I have a medical degree behind my name, provides people entrée to me. But also, at some level of their consciousness, they have chosen to come to me because they know that I’m operating on a level other than the physical. So whether they are conscious of it or not, they’ve chosen to come to me because they are available to look at the emotional and spiritual side, the wholistic. They have an awareness that many patients, who just get into the medical model and never get out, don’t have. My practice is very exciting and very stimulating. Most of the time it’s extremely rewarding because I can work with patients on many levels – on the physical, the spiritual, the nutritional, the environmental. Even if it’s not right at the surface, I just have to dig a little bit and soon I’m hitting paydirt. BL: Could you describe your method of treatment? What is it that you do in your practice? MC: I mostly facilitate. I help them to get in touch with their own questions and answers. So it’s a real facilitating, sharing, exploration. BL: You no longer write prescriptions? Most of what I do in my practice is to facilitate the person in their search for the modality that’s most appropriate for their healing. What I’m available to do is to help them find their own answers. I ask patients to bring as much information as they can: their blood work, any kinds of reports, and I ask them to write out their health history. And it can vary from doing macrobiotic counseling, to helping them to decide whether they want to do chemotherapy or radiation therapy – or, if they are going to have surgery, what they are willing to accept or not accept. It’s a real exciting process, exploring options and encouraging them to use their own intuition to determine what the best choice would be for them at that particular time.

This type of work and eventual application to the veterans who survived brain trauma provided Franz with early insights into neuroplasticity, which is the foundation of the current approach to cognitive retraining. On today’s podcast, Rick Parente, Emeritus Professor at Towson University in Baltimore and a celebrated expert in the field of cognitive retraining will discuss how targeted and specific interventions after a traumatic brain injury are more effective than comprehensive, but non-targeted ones. Because finding ways to help people to learn, remember, and think is as much an art as science, this discussion will lead us all to deploy careful scrutiny when assessing symptom presentation, functional needs, and perceived limitations of the brain. Welcome back to Full PreFrontal, where we are exposing the mysteries of executive function. Sucheta, you’re going to lead us off and help us understand why Oliver Sacks is relevant to today’s conversation and also introduce our guest. When I went on a maternity leave, I won’t name the year, but a girl friend of mine gifted me a book titled ‘An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales’ by renowned neurologist, Oliver Sacks. Sacks had a knack of brining stories of impairment and disorders into the lives of ordinary people who probably had no exposure to anything such as a brain injury or any anomalies to the brain. He, in fact, was known to not just limit to understand the patient’s story by interacting with them in the clinical setting. One of the quotes comes to mind is that he has said that defects, disorders, disease can play a paradoxical role by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence. Until I read Oliver Sacks, I had never known anyone speak so eloquently about neurological diseases, neurological changes, and its profound impact on one’s life. Or particularly, nobody had spoken so clearly about the work that I do. My career is peppered with experiences where I have seen individuals who had skills once, lost them, they had to work on gaining them back. In the process, they have somehow discovered inner transformation and even function at a level when they had never been before or have found a new path. Does one return to original state or does really work on bouncing back to newer states and whatever they may be? An injury or insult to the brain affects attention, memory, and executive function. One needs some skills to learn to compensate for the lack of skills and to work with people and work on one’s self after the brain injury to remove the obstacles that the brain injury brings. Dr. Parente teaches courses on neuropsychological assessment and neurorehabilitation. His first book that he wrote, he co-authored in 1991, that’s called ‘Retraining Memory Techniques and Applications.’ In 1995, he co-authored a second a book which is one of my favorite books. It is sitting in the shelf behind me, that’s called ‘Retraining Cognition Techniques and Applications.’ It summarizes the techniques developed over two decades prior and how to help people restore their mental processes and help them become functional. Sucheta: Let me get started with this question: how would you describe your own executive function? As a psychologist who works on cognitive retraining, have you benefited from your insights into improving skills and managing self and have you applied them to your own life? Personally, every one of them loses it, ability to organize and the ability to retrieve information from memory rapidly or as rapidly as they used to. I think I found ways around that and one of the ways around it, I think, is creating systems. By systems, I mean, for example, something as simple as putting everything that you commonly need every day in a bowl next to the front door so you know where it is. The system of doing that, make sure that you don’t lose things. Also, systems for explaining things to people when you talk to them. We have a mnemonic, one of the mnemonics that we use is called the ‘BOMBS’ pneumonic which is explain or say what you want to say right upfront and then omit the details and then mention it again at the end so that you end up talking about the information at the beginning and also at the end of the conversation to capitalize on what the cognitive psychologists call primacy and recency. There’s different ways of improving organization certainly. I think one of the most fascinating executive function that you have and probably you’re extremely skilled at is your insight and your self-awareness. Particularly somebody who is highly published and has co-authored so many books, you wouldn’t do that because that inherently requires organization too. That brings me to this first question regarding the actual work that you do which is: are all injuries to the brain made equal? For example, is concussion and mild traumatic brain injury and traumatic brain injury, do they fall in the same category even though I know the answer but I would love for you to explain this a little bit. I think the only consistency that you see pretty much across all of those injuries is poor memory. But depending upon the nature of the injury, then different techniques for improving memory are going to be warranted. For example, I deal to some extent with dementia patients. One of the things I learned years ago from a speech and language therapist whose practice was devoted to dealing with Alzheimer’s patients in Florida told me about what I call personal fact repetition tapes where she would simply get the client and their family to provide 100 facts about the person’s life like what was their name, where did they live, what high school did they go to, what was their first job. And she would make a tape – this\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

I think one of the most fascinating executive function that you have and probably you’re extremely skilled at is your insight and your self-awareness. Particularly somebody who is highly published and has co-authored so many books, you wouldn’t do that because that inherently requires organization too. That brings me to this first question regarding the actual work that you do which is: are all injuries to the brain made equal? For example, is concussion and mild traumatic brain injury and traumatic brain injury, do they fall in the same category even though I know the answer but I would love for you to explain this a little bit. I think the only consistency that you see pretty much across all of those injuries is poor memory. But depending upon the nature of the injury, then different techniques for improving memory are going to be warranted. For example, I deal to some extent with dementia patients. One of the things I learned years ago from a speech and language therapist whose practice was devoted to dealing with Alzheimer’s patients in Florida told me about what I call personal fact repetition tapes where she would simply get the client and their family to provide 100 facts about the person’s life like what was their name, where did they live, what high school did they go to, what was their first job. And she would make a tape – this\n\n"

There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. We changed his bed sheets as he's been sleeping without a diaper because of a chemotherapy induced rash from contact with it. We may need to increase his pain medicine in order for him to tolerate it. As he calmed down he said, \"I don't feel very good.\" He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! Amazingly,\n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days.

Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" \". from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. I have watched many women working hard to deal with the pain of contractions and then later working even harder pushing with them. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

There is now a coated form of the medicine that is supposed to have toned down those effects, so we will hope that he tolerates it well. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. He's not complaining about that currently, but does complain of throat pain especially when he coughs up some mucous. The mucous is less bloody today than yesterday, but I'm not sure why. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. We changed his bed sheets as he's been sleeping without a diaper because of a chemotherapy induced rash from contact with it. We may need to increase his pain medicine in order for him to tolerate it. As he calmed down he said, \"I don't feel very good.\" He coughed a little more and had more to spit, but in between he slept reasonably well. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. This is our Lightening McQueen wall, which everyone who comes in the room loves. They always send something for the walls. Henry has decided to forgo nursing school, and instead wants to be a trash collector. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. The cells in his mouth and esophagus are sloughing off due to chemotherapy and this creates a mucous abundance in his mouth. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! Amazingly,\n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus.

Thus, if you are looking for drilling rigs for sale in Australia, then consider also drill pipes carefully. You can shell out as much as $25,000 or more for a string of drill pipe, depending on the size. Drill pipes have a range of types to choose, from integral forged pipe, which is the most common, the press type, and the fit type. You must take time to research about the product before purchasing a drill pipe, the same as you would when buying other products. You must consider the power and the type of the rig to use, which is intended for the pipe. You will have problems and waste your money if you will buy a pipe that does not match with your rig in size. In drilling, this is extremely critical because you’ll be pushing the drill pipe’s torque limits to the edge. Moreover, great cyclical forces are at work with horizontal drilling. If you insist on buying low cost pipes for your drilling project, expect that disaster can happen at any time. Drill pipes are very expensive, thus it is imperative to use and handle them with care. If you want to maximize or extend the service life of the pipe, then implement proper maintenance procedures for the tool. Another best practice to help maintain the pipe in good condition is to alternate the rods in the basket so that you will not be using the same rod all the time, driving it into the ground always. Why choose the automatic machine? Manual and semi-automatic types are also available, but the automatic type of carton packing machine will give you a competitive advantage over your competitors or at least keep you at par with them. It enables you to pack securely a wide range of products fast from basic supplies to computers, liquid products, food, powder, pharmaceutical products, electronic gadgets, and more. Investing in automatic carton packing machines will give you a high rate of returns for your business, enabling you to double or even triple your current production. You will also cut down other costs such as the production, energy, labor, and overhead costs. In the long-term, you will see in your cost analysis the realistic and tangible benefits provided by automated carton sealing machines. How to choose the machine? Since this machine is considered an investment, you should carefully choose with diligence the type and features of the machine. Cheaper automated machines are manufactured by India and China. A good machine has one multi-functional application program that is able to synchronize different packing controllers to operate. Many industries need their sheet metals to be cut down to size. This cannot be easily achieved needing the help of an efficient CNC cutter. How does the Cutter make the Cut? A CNC cutter releases gas at high velocity in a well-controlled manner along with an arc in order to cut through steel sheets. This high-pressure nozzle is responsible for ensuring that the gas would be able to cut through any steel plate that are 25mm thick. § July 27th, 2010 § Filed under Nano Medicine Comments Off on Prostate CSCs sensitive to gamma-tocotrienol?

International Stem Cell Corporation (OTCBB:ISCO), http://www.intlstemcell.com, announced today that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with ARG Vermogensverwaltung AG (‘ARG’), a German Investment Fund, to create a new European subsidiary (‘ISCO Europe‘) to be funded with up to $10 million of capital derived from ARG and other independent sources in Europe. ISCO Europe will be licensed by ISCO to develop and market therapeutic products derived from ISCO’s technology throughout the Euro Currency Countries and Switzerland. New technologies developed by either ISCO or ISCO Europe will be made mutually available, thus expanding the total funding available to ISCO worldwide without issuing new ISCO shares and enhancing the potential market and scientific development capacity of both companies. It is expected that the new subsidiary will be funded initially by a private equity investment by ARG and that ARG will then assist in forming an investment group to invest up to $10 million concurrently with the listing of ISCO Europe on the Deutsche Bourse, the largest Securities Exchange in Europe. ‘Although negotiations are still at the non-binding memorandum of understanding stage, this transaction, when completed, will expand ISCO’s access to capital for worldwide expansion and ISCO’s access to new scientific development without requiring equity dilution of ISCO’s current shareholders. We are creating an investment, research and development, marketing and distribution entity by adding capital and human resources from Europe to help fulfill ISCO’s goal of supplying its proprietary cells and cell therapies to the world,’ said Kenneth Aldrich, Chairman and co-founder of ISCO. ISCO’s core technology, parthenogenesis, results in creation of pluripotent human stem cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs). These proprietary cells avoid ethical issues associated with use or destruction of viable human embryos and, unlike most other major stem cell types, can be immune matched and be a source of therapeutic cells with minimal rejection after transplantation into hundreds of millions of individuals of differing racial groups. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary, Lifeline Cell Technology, and is developing a line of cosmeceutical products via its subsidiary, Lifeline Skin Care. ISCO is advancing novel human stem cell-based therapies where cells have been proven to be efficacious but traditional small molecule and protein therapeutics have not. International Stem Cell Corporation (OTCBB: ISCO), http://www.internationalstemcell.com, and Insight Bioventures India Private Limited (IBVI), (http://www.insightbioventures.in) announced today that they have signed a letter of intent concerning funding and establishment of an Indian affiliate of ISCO (ISCO India). The goal is to establish world-class development and manufacturing operations for ISCO’s research and pharmaceutical products in India, including its Lifeline Cell Technology® research products and human corneal tissue, CytoCor™, for treatment of corneal vision impairment and testing of chemicals. In collaboration with Sristi Biosciences (http://www.sristibio.com), a full-fledged developer, manufacturer and commercial operation and the therapeutic arm of Indian bio industry leader Sri Bio (http://www.sribio.com), IBVI facilitated the earliest submissions and approvals of the stem cell therapy guidelines of India. Some of IBVI’s major collaborators include ophthalmology research center and hospital, Sankara Nethralaya (http://www.sankaranethralaya.org), The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (a federally funded institute run by the Indian government, http://www.ccmb.res.in), the All-India Institute for Medical Sciences (http://www.aiims.edu), and the Indian Council for Medical Research (http://www.icmr.nic.in). Under the letter of intent, IBVI will lead the funding and establishment of ISCO India with facilities and staff. ISCO will train Indian scientists and commercial staff and provide rights to the company’s technologies, products and intellectual property as needed. ISCO India will be managed by a combined team of experienced development and business executives from IBVI and Sristi Biosciences in India and senior executives of ISCO in the US. ISCO India will be based in Hyderabad and continue to work closely with the leading team of ophthalmology scientists and clinicians at Sankara Nethralaya in Chennai as well as researchers and government bodies across India. Formal details of this arrangement are expected to become the subject of a definitive agreement in the near future. ‘IBVI and their corporate, academic and government network provide ISCO with an unparalleled opportunity to tap into the rapidly growing research product market in India and develop CytoCor with a team of experienced scientists and clinicians in the country with most corneal blindness and vision impairment in the world. Furthermore, IBVI’s Biofund investors enable us to do so without ISCO capital investment or issuance of equity shares. Finally, by establishing our own affiliate in India, ISCO will be able to participate in the economic benefits of our technologies and products while retaining the intellectual property control that is so important across Asia,’ says Brian Lundstrom, ISCO’s President.

This brings us to an inherent contradiction in the medical management of asthma, once we acknowledge the many environmentally induced attacks which occur daily in the lives of asthmatics and the medications used to respond to them. In the above referenced article, some benefits accrued to the experimental group. synthetic “fragrances”), for reasons of “trade secrets”, are nevertheless proven asthma triggers. Most consumers do not know that fragrances may contain toluene or benzene derivatives; that air fresheners can contain naphthelene; that clothing may be treated with formaldehyde (released during ironing), that pesticides contain carrier solvents and synergists which were not part of registration testing etc. Doctors can recommend patients familiarize themselves with these threats posed by the environment but change must be addressed at the source. Physician’s groups may make their greatest contribution to the management and prevention of asthma by lobbying government and industry to alter manufacturing and labelling policies. This can reduce reliance upon drugs which have deleterious short and long term side effects and basically profit the same companies which manufacture products inducing asthma. Studies of IgE mediated vs. non-allergic asthma conditions would also go far towards identifying these terrible threats to the public health at every stage of life. Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 1998, and our headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved our first product, Korlym® (“mifepristone”) 300 mg tablets, as a once-daily oral medication for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Our financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of Corcept Therapeutics UK Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary, which we incorporated in the United Kingdom in March 2017. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions each quarter, including those related to revenue recognition, recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, inventory, allowances for doubtful accounts and other accrued liabilities, including our bonus accrual, clinical trial accruals and stock-based compensation. If no Level 1 inputs are available, we consider (i) quoted prices in non-active markets for identical instruments; (ii) active markets for similar instruments; (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the instrument; and (iv) inputs that are not directly observable, but that are corroborated by observable data (“Level 2 inputs”). We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and report them at fair value as “cash equivalents” or “marketable securities” on our balance sheet, with related unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity. Because product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained, we record the cost of manufacturing our product candidates as research and development expenses at the time such costs are incurred. We capitalize to inventory manufacturing costs related to Korlym. We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and determine the cost of inventory we sell using the specific identification method, which approximates a first-in, first-out basis. We write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing Korlym, including materials, third-party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs, based on the number of Korlym tablets for which we recognize revenue, as well as costs of stability testing, logistics and distribution. We classify inventory we do not expect to consume within 12 months of the balance sheet date as strategic inventory, a noncurrent asset. We also sell Korlym to a specialty distributor (“SD”), for which we recognize revenue at the time the SD receives Korlym. To determine our revenue from the sale of Korlym, we (i) identify our contract with each customer; (ii) identify the obligations of Corcept and the customer under the contract; (iii) determine the contracted transaction price; and (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract’s performance obligations, which in our case consists of delivering Korlym to the customer; and (v) recognize revenue once Korlym has been delivered, provided we deem it probable that we will collect the payment due to us. Confirmation of coverage by private or government insurance or by a third-party charity is a prerequisite for selling Korlym to a patient. To determine net product revenue, we deduct from sales the cost of our patient co-pay assistance program and our estimates of (a) government chargebacks and rebates, (b) discounts provided to our SD for prompt payment and (c) reserves for expected Korlym returns. To determine the appropriate amount to reserve against these rebates, we identify Korlym sold to patients covered by government-funded programs, apply the applicable government discount to these sales, then estimate, based on our experience, the portion of total rebates we expect will be claimed. We then (i) deduct this reserve from revenue in the period to which the rebates relate and (ii) include in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet a current liability of equal amount. Although we sell Korlym to the SD at full price, some of the government entities to which the SD sells receive a discount. The SD recovers such discounts by reducing its payment to us (this reduction is called a “chargeback”). We deduct from our revenue in each period chargebacks claimed by the SD for Korlym we sold to the SD that period.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

Thus, if you are looking for drilling rigs for sale in Australia, then consider also drill pipes carefully. You can shell out as much as $25,000 or more for a string of drill pipe, depending on the size. Drill pipes have a range of types to choose, from integral forged pipe, which is the most common, the press type, and the fit type. You must take time to research about the product before purchasing a drill pipe, the same as you would when buying other products. You must consider the power and the type of the rig to use, which is intended for the pipe. You will have problems and waste your money if you will buy a pipe that does not match with your rig in size. In drilling, this is extremely critical because you’ll be pushing the drill pipe’s torque limits to the edge. Moreover, great cyclical forces are at work with horizontal drilling. If you insist on buying low cost pipes for your drilling project, expect that disaster can happen at any time. Drill pipes are very expensive, thus it is imperative to use and handle them with care. If you want to maximize or extend the service life of the pipe, then implement proper maintenance procedures for the tool. Another best practice to help maintain the pipe in good condition is to alternate the rods in the basket so that you will not be using the same rod all the time, driving it into the ground always. Why choose the automatic machine? Manual and semi-automatic types are also available, but the automatic type of carton packing machine will give you a competitive advantage over your competitors or at least keep you at par with them. It enables you to pack securely a wide range of products fast from basic supplies to computers, liquid products, food, powder, pharmaceutical products, electronic gadgets, and more. Investing in automatic carton packing machines will give you a high rate of returns for your business, enabling you to double or even triple your current production. You will also cut down other costs such as the production, energy, labor, and overhead costs. In the long-term, you will see in your cost analysis the realistic and tangible benefits provided by automated carton sealing machines. How to choose the machine? Since this machine is considered an investment, you should carefully choose with diligence the type and features of the machine. Cheaper automated machines are manufactured by India and China. A good machine has one multi-functional application program that is able to synchronize different packing controllers to operate. Many industries need their sheet metals to be cut down to size. This cannot be easily achieved needing the help of an efficient CNC cutter. How does the Cutter make the Cut? A CNC cutter releases gas at high velocity in a well-controlled manner along with an arc in order to cut through steel sheets. This high-pressure nozzle is responsible for ensuring that the gas would be able to cut through any steel plate that are 25mm thick. § July 27th, 2010 § Filed under Nano Medicine Comments Off on Prostate CSCs sensitive to gamma-tocotrienol?

International Stem Cell Corporation (OTCBB:ISCO), http://www.intlstemcell.com, announced today that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with ARG Vermogensverwaltung AG (‘ARG’), a German Investment Fund, to create a new European subsidiary (‘ISCO Europe‘) to be funded with up to $10 million of capital derived from ARG and other independent sources in Europe. ISCO Europe will be licensed by ISCO to develop and market therapeutic products derived from ISCO’s technology throughout the Euro Currency Countries and Switzerland. New technologies developed by either ISCO or ISCO Europe will be made mutually available, thus expanding the total funding available to ISCO worldwide without issuing new ISCO shares and enhancing the potential market and scientific development capacity of both companies. It is expected that the new subsidiary will be funded initially by a private equity investment by ARG and that ARG will then assist in forming an investment group to invest up to $10 million concurrently with the listing of ISCO Europe on the Deutsche Bourse, the largest Securities Exchange in Europe. ‘Although negotiations are still at the non-binding memorandum of understanding stage, this transaction, when completed, will expand ISCO’s access to capital for worldwide expansion and ISCO’s access to new scientific development without requiring equity dilution of ISCO’s current shareholders. We are creating an investment, research and development, marketing and distribution entity by adding capital and human resources from Europe to help fulfill ISCO’s goal of supplying its proprietary cells and cell therapies to the world,’ said Kenneth Aldrich, Chairman and co-founder of ISCO. ISCO’s core technology, parthenogenesis, results in creation of pluripotent human stem cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs). These proprietary cells avoid ethical issues associated with use or destruction of viable human embryos and, unlike most other major stem cell types, can be immune matched and be a source of therapeutic cells with minimal rejection after transplantation into hundreds of millions of individuals of differing racial groups. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary, Lifeline Cell Technology, and is developing a line of cosmeceutical products via its subsidiary, Lifeline Skin Care. ISCO is advancing novel human stem cell-based therapies where cells have been proven to be efficacious but traditional small molecule and protein therapeutics have not. International Stem Cell Corporation (OTCBB: ISCO), http://www.internationalstemcell.com, and Insight Bioventures India Private Limited (IBVI), (http://www.insightbioventures.in) announced today that they have signed a letter of intent concerning funding and establishment of an Indian affiliate of ISCO (ISCO India). The goal is to establish world-class development and manufacturing operations for ISCO’s research and pharmaceutical products in India, including its Lifeline Cell Technology® research products and human corneal tissue, CytoCor™, for treatment of corneal vision impairment and testing of chemicals. In collaboration with Sristi Biosciences (http://www.sristibio.com), a full-fledged developer, manufacturer and commercial operation and the therapeutic arm of Indian bio industry leader Sri Bio (http://www.sribio.com), IBVI facilitated the earliest submissions and approvals of the stem cell therapy guidelines of India. Some of IBVI’s major collaborators include ophthalmology research center and hospital, Sankara Nethralaya (http://www.sankaranethralaya.org), The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (a federally funded institute run by the Indian government, http://www.ccmb.res.in), the All-India Institute for Medical Sciences (http://www.aiims.edu), and the Indian Council for Medical Research (http://www.icmr.nic.in). Under the letter of intent, IBVI will lead the funding and establishment of ISCO India with facilities and staff. ISCO will train Indian scientists and commercial staff and provide rights to the company’s technologies, products and intellectual property as needed. ISCO India will be managed by a combined team of experienced development and business executives from IBVI and Sristi Biosciences in India and senior executives of ISCO in the US. ISCO India will be based in Hyderabad and continue to work closely with the leading team of ophthalmology scientists and clinicians at Sankara Nethralaya in Chennai as well as researchers and government bodies across India. Formal details of this arrangement are expected to become the subject of a definitive agreement in the near future. ‘IBVI and their corporate, academic and government network provide ISCO with an unparalleled opportunity to tap into the rapidly growing research product market in India and develop CytoCor with a team of experienced scientists and clinicians in the country with most corneal blindness and vision impairment in the world. Furthermore, IBVI’s Biofund investors enable us to do so without ISCO capital investment or issuance of equity shares. Finally, by establishing our own affiliate in India, ISCO will be able to participate in the economic benefits of our technologies and products while retaining the intellectual property control that is so important across Asia,’ says Brian Lundstrom, ISCO’s President.
