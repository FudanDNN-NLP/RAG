It relates the number of phases, degrees of freedom, and chemical components in a system. The phase rule is represented by the equation π + F = C + 2, where π represents the number of phases present in equilibrium (such as solid, liquid, or gas), F represents the number of degrees of freedom or independent variables (usually temperature, pressure, and composition), and C represents the number of chemical components required to describe the system. The term \"phases\" refers to distinct states of matter that coexist in a system at equilibrium. The number of phases can vary depending on factors such as temperature and pressure. In other words, they represent the number of parameters that can be changed while still maintaining a stable system. Chemical components refer to the minimum number of chemically independent constituents needed to fully describe a system. For example, if we consider water as a single component system (H2O), then C would be equal to 1. By applying Gibbs' phase rule equation π + F = C + 2 to a given system's conditions and properties such as temperature and pressure variations along with knowledge about its chemical components involved one can determine how many phases will exist at equilibrium under those conditions. Overall, Gibbs' phase rule provides valuable insights into understanding how different factors like phases present in equilibrium, degrees of freedom available for variation within a system's properties, and the number of chemical components required to describe the system are interrelated.

Compounds of this class are uricogenic agents in man . Upon completion of reaction (monitored with TLC), product was recrystallized from methanol and purified by washing. Spectral data including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HREI-MS for all synthesized compounds were recorded. In the continuation of our effort for enzyme inhibition , we have synthesized series of indole based thiadiazole derivatives, a new class of β-glucuronidase inhibitors. All the compounds (1–22) were screened for β-glucuronidase activity. All the compounds showed outstanding inhibition when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone with IC50 value 48.1 ± 1.2 µM (Table 1). Structure activity relationship (SAR) has been established mainly based on the substitution pattern on phenyl ring attached to thiadiazole. The greater potential shown by this compound is seems mainly due to the hydroxyl group on phenyl ring which might be involve in hydrogen bonding with the active site of enzyme. The mono-hydroxy analogs like 3, a 2-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 3.1 ± 0.01 µM), 4, a 3-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 7.1 ± 0.05 µM), 9, a 4-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 5.3 ± 0.1 µM) and 13, a 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy analog (IC50 = 12.3 ± 0.3 µM) also showed outstanding potential. The dihydroxy analogs are superior when mono-hydroxy analogs. In nitro substituted analogs like 10, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 24.38 ± 0.3 µM) is predominating over 11, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 35.30 ± 0.5 µM) and 12, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 28.2 1 ± 0.4 µM) which shows that position of substituent plays an important role. Similar pattern was also observed in other substituted analog like flouro analogs 18, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 4.6 ± 0.2 µM) with 19, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 9.9 ± 0.4 µM) and 20, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 6.2 ± 0.3 µM) and chloro substituted analogs like compound 21, a 4-chloro analog (12.0 ± 0.30 µM) is more potent than 22, a 4-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.28 ± 0.3 µM)and 15, a 3-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.8 ± 0.3 µM). The concentration inhibition IC50 values of thiadiazole synthesized derivatives as β-glucoronidase inhibitors are presented in (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the inhibitory potency of the tilted compounds depends mainly on the type, number and positions of the functional group in the substitute group R of the synthesized derivatives. Table 2 summarized the calculated binding energies of the stable complexes ligand- β-glucoronidase, number of established intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the synthesized compounds (1, 4 and 6) and active site residues of β-glucoronidase. 1, the highest activity of synthesized compound 6 compared to low active compounds 4 and 1 is mainly return to (ii) the stability of the formed complex between the docked compounds and β-glucoronidase, and the (ii) number of hydrogen bonding established between the docked ligands and the active site residues of the β-glucoronidase. Indeed, the formed complex between 6 and β-glucoronidase has the lowest binding energy of − 8.6 kcal/mol compared to 4 and 1 with binding energies of the stables complexes between the two compound and β-glucoronidase are of − 8.3 and − 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2). The strongest hydrogen bond is formed between GLU45 amino acid and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of catechol moiety of a 6 with distance of 1.66 Å.

Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions. A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution. Because of its high boiling point, 189 C, DMSO evaporates slowly at \n\n (13) A solution of TFD (4.60 mL, 0.50 M, 2.30 mmol) in trifluoroacetone/CH2Cl2 (2:1 v/v) at –20 ° was added to a solution of adamantane (136 mg, 0.100 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) also at –20 °, while stirring vigorously magnetically. The progress of the reaction was followed by GLC analysis, which indicated that 97% of the adamantane was converted to its hydroxylated products in 40 minutes. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator (–20 °, 15 mmHg) afforded a mixture of the 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane (156 mg, 91%) and the monohydroxy adamantane (4.6 mg, 3%). Spectral data for 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane is as follows. IR (KBr): 3275 (O-H), 2930 and 2851 (C-H), 1453, 1135, 1027, 968, 911, 801 cm−1. 1H NMR (CDCl3): 1.50 (m, 2 H), 1.62 (apparent d, 8 H), 1.65 (s, 2 H), 2.23 (m, 2 H), 4.88 (OH). Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, 18.5 C, means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. In its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it \n\nDiabetes is an emerging metabolic disorder. We have synthesized 25 tricyclic 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-ones hybrids and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Compounds 6h and 6d have shown stronger activity than that of acarbose. Compound 6h exhibited the highest inhibition with an IC50 of 104.07 µM. Molecular modelling studies revealed that compound 6h inhibits α-glucosidase due to the formation of a stable ligand-α-glucosidase complex and extra hydrogen bond interactions, and directed in the binding site by Trp329. This variety of biological activity makes α-glucosidase inhibitors a class of compounds with multiple therapeutic applications. Among them, is the N-containing carbasugars such as validamine and valienamine, which have proven to be lead compounds for the development of clinically important agents such as acarbose (Fig. It has been shown that the valienamine moiety in acarbose mimics the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that binds to and inhibits α-glucosidase . We are interested in exploring and developing α-glucosidase inhibitors in an attempt to overcome the side effects associated with sugar mimetic agents. According to our previous results, we decided to modify scaffolds well accepted in medicinal chemistry, such as pyridine, triazole, and pyrimidine. Herein, we designed two series of phenoxypyrido-triazolopyrimidinones and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. A significant inhibitory activity was observed for the newly synthesized compounds and IC50 values lower than that of acarbose were obtained for two compounds.

        "context": "All compounds showed outstanding β-glucuronidase activity with IC50 values ranging between 0.5 ± 0.08 to 38.9 ± 0.8 µM when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone (IC50 value of 48.1 ± 1.2 µM). β-Glucuronidases enzymes belong to family glycoside hydrolase GH1, GH2 and GH79, and reduce glucuronic acid sugar moiety from non-reducing termini. β-Glucuronidase in humane has resulted in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome), which is characterized by growth of glycosaminoglycans in cells of most tissues [10, 11]. Compounds of this class are uricogenic agents in man . Upon completion of reaction (monitored with TLC), product was recrystallized from methanol and purified by washing. Spectral data including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HREI-MS for all synthesized compounds were recorded. In the continuation of our effort for enzyme inhibition , we have synthesized series of indole based thiadiazole derivatives, a new class of β-glucuronidase inhibitors. All the compounds (1–22) were screened for β-glucuronidase activity. All the compounds showed outstanding inhibition when compared with standard d-saccharic acid 1,4 lactone with IC50 value 48.1 ± 1.2 µM (Table 1). Structure activity relationship (SAR) has been established mainly based on the substitution pattern on phenyl ring attached to thiadiazole. The greater potential shown by this compound is seems mainly due to the hydroxyl group on phenyl ring which might be involve in hydrogen bonding with the active site of enzyme. The mono-hydroxy analogs like 3, a 2-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 3.1 ± 0.01 µM), 4, a 3-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 7.1 ± 0.05 µM), 9, a 4-hydroxy analog (IC50 = 5.3 ± 0.1 µM) and 13, a 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy analog (IC50 = 12.3 ± 0.3 µM) also showed outstanding potential. The dihydroxy analogs are superior when mono-hydroxy analogs. In nitro substituted analogs like 10, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 24.38 ± 0.3 µM) is predominating over 11, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 35.30 ± 0.5 µM) and 12, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 28.2 1 ± 0.4 µM) which shows that position of substituent plays an important role. Similar pattern was also observed in other substituted analog like flouro analogs 18, a 2-nitro analog (IC50 value 4.6 ± 0.2 µM) with 19, a 3-nitro analog (IC50 value 9.9 ± 0.4 µM) and 20, a 4-nitro analog (IC50 value 6.2 ± 0.3 µM) and chloro substituted analogs like compound 21, a 4-chloro analog (12.0 ± 0.30 µM) is more potent than 22, a 4-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.28 ± 0.3 µM)and 15, a 3-chloro analog (IC50 value 19.8 ± 0.3 µM). The concentration inhibition IC50 values of thiadiazole synthesized derivatives as β-glucoronidase inhibitors are presented in (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the inhibitory potency of the tilted compounds depends mainly on the type, number and positions of the functional group in the substitute group R of the synthesized derivatives. Table 2 summarized the calculated binding energies of the stable complexes ligand- β-glucoronidase, number of established intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the synthesized compounds (1, 4 and 6) and active site residues of β-glucoronidase. 1, the highest activity of synthesized compound 6 compared to low active compounds 4 and 1 is mainly return to (ii) the stability of the formed complex between the docked compounds and β-glucoronidase, and the (ii) number of hydrogen bonding established between the docked ligands and the active site residues of the β-glucoronidase. Indeed, the formed complex between 6 and β-glucoronidase has the lowest binding energy of − 8.6 kcal/mol compared to 4 and 1 with binding energies of the stables complexes between the two compound and β-glucoronidase are of − 8.3 and − 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2). The strongest hydrogen bond is formed between GLU45 amino acid and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of catechol moiety of a 6 with distance of 1.66 Å.

Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions. A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution. Because of its high boiling point, 189 C, DMSO evaporates slowly at \n\n (13) A solution of TFD (4.60 mL, 0.50 M, 2.30 mmol) in trifluoroacetone/CH2Cl2 (2:1 v/v) at –20 ° was added to a solution of adamantane (136 mg, 0.100 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) also at –20 °, while stirring vigorously magnetically. The progress of the reaction was followed by GLC analysis, which indicated that 97% of the adamantane was converted to its hydroxylated products in 40 minutes. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator (–20 °, 15 mmHg) afforded a mixture of the 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane (156 mg, 91%) and the monohydroxy adamantane (4.6 mg, 3%). Spectral data for 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane is as follows. IR (KBr): 3275 (O-H), 2930 and 2851 (C-H), 1453, 1135, 1027, 968, 911, 801 cm−1. 1H NMR (CDCl3): 1.50 (m, 2 H), 1.62 (apparent d, 8 H), 1.65 (s, 2 H), 2.23 (m, 2 H), 4.88 (OH). Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, 18.5 C, means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. In its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it \n\nDiabetes is an emerging metabolic disorder. We have synthesized 25 tricyclic 2-phenoxypyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5(4H)-ones hybrids and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Compounds 6h and 6d have shown stronger activity than that of acarbose. Compound 6h exhibited the highest inhibition with an IC50 of 104.07 µM. Molecular modelling studies revealed that compound 6h inhibits α-glucosidase due to the formation of a stable ligand-α-glucosidase complex and extra hydrogen bond interactions, and directed in the binding site by Trp329. This variety of biological activity makes α-glucosidase inhibitors a class of compounds with multiple therapeutic applications. Among them, is the N-containing carbasugars such as validamine and valienamine, which have proven to be lead compounds for the development of clinically important agents such as acarbose (Fig. It has been shown that the valienamine moiety in acarbose mimics the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that binds to and inhibits α-glucosidase . We are interested in exploring and developing α-glucosidase inhibitors in an attempt to overcome the side effects associated with sugar mimetic agents. According to our previous results, we decided to modify scaffolds well accepted in medicinal chemistry, such as pyridine, triazole, and pyrimidine. Herein, we designed two series of phenoxypyrido-triazolopyrimidinones and evaluated their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. A significant inhibitory activity was observed for the newly synthesized compounds and IC50 values lower than that of acarbose were obtained for two compounds. TLC on DC Mikrokarten polygram SIL G/UV254 (thickness: 0.25 mm from the Macherey–Nagel Firm Duren) was used to monitor the reactions and check the purity of compounds. 2-Hydrazino-3-carboxylic pyridine (5.5 mmol) was added portion wise to a solution of diphenyl-N-cyanoimidocarbonate (5 mmol) in ethanol (20 mL) at room temperature.

At room temperature, potassium carbonate (0.6 mmol) was added portion wise over a period of 5 min to a stirred solution of 1 (0.5 mmol) in DMF (5 mL). After 10 min, the appropriate alkyl or heteroalkyl halide (1 mmol) was added dropwise and then the resulting mixture was left stirring at room temperature for 18 h.

After echo is formed, some transverse magnetisations remains. There are three main methods of manipulating contrast at this stage, namely balanced steady-state free-precession (SSFP) that does not spoil the remaining transverse magnetisation, but attempts to recover them (thus producing T2-weighted images); the sequence with spoiler gradient that averages the transverse magnetisations (thus producing mixed T1 and T2-weighted images), and RF spoiler that vary the phases of RF pulse to completely eliminates the transverse magnetisation, thus producing pure T1-weighted images. This gradient modifies the spin phase in a spatially dependent manner so that at the end of the gradient, the signal will be completely canceled because the coherence between the spins will be completely destroyed. At this point, the reading gradient of opposite polarity is applied, so as to compensate for the effect of the disparity gradient. When the area of the reading gradient is equal to that of the mismatching gradient, the spins will have a coherent new phase (except for the effects of T2* relaxation), and therefore, a signal will be detectable again. This signal takes the name of echo, or more specifically, gradient echo signal, because it is produced by rephasing due to a gradient (unlike the spin echo signal, whose rephasing is due to a radiofrequency pulse). The sequences of the gradient echo type allow to achieve very short repetition times since the acquisition of an echo corresponds to the acquisition of a k-space line, and this acquisition can be made quick by increasing the amplitude of the gradients of rephasing and reading. A sequence of the spin echo type must instead wait for the exhaustion of the signal that is formed spontaneously after the application of the excitation impulse before it can produce an echo (free induction decay). For comparison purposes, the repetition time of a gradient echo sequence is of the order of 3 milliseconds, versus about 30 ms of a spin echo sequence. Spoiling At the end of the reading, the residual transverse magnetization can be terminated (through the application of suitable gradients and the excitation through pulses with a variable phase radiofrequency) or maintained. In the first case there is a spoiled sequence, such as the FLASH (Fast Low-Angle Shot) sequence, while in the second case there are SSFP (Steady-state free precession imaging) sequences. While spoiled gradient-echo sequences refer to a steady state of the longitudinal magnetization only, SSFP gradient-echo sequences include transverse coherences (magnetizations) from overlapping multi-order spin echoes and stimulated echoes. Effective T2 (T2* or \"T2-star\") T2*-weighted imaging can be created as a postexcitation refocused gradient echo sequence with small flip angle.

The first one is called T1, which refers to the spin-lattice relaxation time. T1 represents the time it takes for the longitudinal component of the total nuclear magnetic moment vector (parallel to the constant magnetic field) to exponentially relax from a higher energy state to thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. The second time constant is known as T2, which corresponds to the spin-spin relaxation time. Both T1 and T2 play important roles in magnetic resonance imaging techniques. By measuring and analyzing variations in these time constants across different materials, researchers can gather valuable information for creating detailed images using magnetic resonance imaging.
