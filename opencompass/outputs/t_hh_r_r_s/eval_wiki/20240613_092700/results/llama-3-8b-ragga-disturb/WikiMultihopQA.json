Firstly, both Visconti and Fellini started their careers in the neorealist genre. Visconti was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his exploration of Italian history and class struggles in films like \"The Leopard\" (1963). On the other hand, Fellini had a more fantastical and surrealistic style, often blending reality and dreams in films like \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960) and \"8½\" (1963). Furthermore, both Visconti and Fellini were politically and culturally involved in their work. While Visconti's films often had a more overt political message, Fellini's works focused on personal and societal reflections. Lastly, both directors experienced a neurological disease towards the end of their careers. Despite this, Visconti showed incredible resilience and continued to direct films and plays as an infirm. In summary, Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini had similarities in terms of their involvement in the neorealist genre, their distinctive personalities and creative styles, as well as their experiences with a right-hemispheric stroke towards the end of their careers.

His lifelong career on the outdoor entertainment circuit as a major sideshow attraction with Barnum & Bailey, among others, made him a popular cultural icon. Biography\nSchlitzie's true birth date, name, location and parents are unknown; the information on his death certificate and gravesite indicate that he was born on September 10, 1901, in The Bronx, New York, though some sources have claimed that he was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Claims that he was born in Yucatán, Mexico, are mistaken reflections of Schlitzie's occasional fanciful billing as \"Maggie, last of the Aztec Children\". Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career. Those who knew him alternately used masculine and feminine pronouns. Freaks and later work\nSchlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \"Princess Bibi\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie. According to Unks, Schlitzie seemed to miss the carnival badly, and being away from the public eye had made him very depressed. Final years\nIn his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. He liked going to MacArthur Park at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, where he would visit the lake with his guardian, feeding the pigeons and ducks and performing for passersby. Death\nOn September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \"Shlitze Surtees\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights. The Ramones song 'Pinhead' was inspired by him.

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident. Three years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Cast Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso David Morse as Mike Webster Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Will Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Music James Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. Release The first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized. Accolades Controversies Family members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. The Thames Star, a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as \"screamingly funny\". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled A Sure Cure for Pokeritis), along with many of his other works, as \"Favorite Film Features\". However, the comedy style of A Cure for Pokeritis has not aged well, especially in contrast to Mack Sennett's slapstick films and the works of later comedians such as Charlie Chaplin \n\n Bar-B-Que Movie is an 11-minute Super 8 film directed by American actor/filmmaker Alex Winter, created in 1988.

When Sarah’s dog suffered an anaphylactic reaction, Sarah never dreamed the physical and emotional stress of the incident would trigger her own life-threatening heart event. The pair were out walking on a November morning in 2017, when Mia the dog was stung by a bee. Within minutes Sarah could see she was struggling to breathe. Once at the hospital, staff quickly hooked Sarah up to an electrocardiograph (ECG) machine and carried out some blood tests, which soon revealed damage to Sarah’s heart. The angiogram revealed Sarah was suffering from a little-known condition called takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Sarah spent 24 hours in intensive care before spending a further six days on the cardiac ward. Sarah remains unsure whether her event was purely as a result of the physical and emotional stress caused by the situation with her dog, or whether it was a culmination of a particularly stressful period in her life. Sarah has also found it difficult to get accurate information on what to expect during the recovery period. Sarah says it’s only recently that she’s begun to feel better. Sarah is not alone in her recovery experience – recent research from the UK has indicated that recovery from takotsubo may take longer than clinicians first thought. Sarah’s ongoing symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and pain in her arms and chest. Although these have been false alarms, one of the visits prompted clinicians to do a Holter monitor test which revealed she was suffering from bradycardia, an unusually low heart rate. The lack of information and available treatment for these ongoing symptoms has been a source of frustration for Sarah. Meanwhile, an outpatient appointment at Greenlane Hospital about six months after the event, left Sarah worrying that her symptoms were all in her head. Meanwhile she feels some people have been baffled by her slow recovery. I’m sure my heart was broken and I suffered stress related symptoms. I cried about that . Reach out to people if needed Sarah .

Well, it’s not exactly that, and it’s much more than that. What most people confuse it with is the symptom of cataplexy, which is unique to narcolepsy, but not the only symptom of narcolepsy. Sufferers experience it most in emotional situations, which could be a shock, surprise or a laugh. However, if you physically opened their eyelid they would be able to see. This manifests during the day as EDS, automatic behaviour and other consequences of chronic sleep deprivation and fatigue. A friend of mine once said to me ‘You are the one person I know who really could fall asleep on a washing-line!”. Anyway, that’s the medical stuff out of the way, even though it doesn’t touch the surface of what’s actually going on inside. At best, it can be managed to a degree. I found it impossible to work to someone else’s schedule, with stringent targets attached which caused additional stress and exacerbated my symptoms. I ended up losing my job, and sunk deep into the depths of despair for a couple of years. I tried to explain to people but they just didn’t understand. I thought they didn’t want to understand because they just wanted to knock me down. Since I had my ‘breakthrough’, and completely changed the way I think, the narcolepsy has become so much easier to deal with. I now realise that other people CAN’T know what it is like to deal with, as they don’t experience it themselves. I am aware there are a lot of ‘invisible’ illnesses that people are dealing with. What me and my friends all have in common is a ‘warrior spirit’. We rarely complain. We are much more accepting of others. We focus on our blessings far more than our limitations. I have learned that many people are fighting a battle that we know nothing about. Julie Flygare is an incredible lady who does live with narcolepsy and cataplexy. She began experiencing symptoms while at University studying Law. Julie has written the best book available that illustrates what it means to live with narcolepsy. What I love about it is that it is not a ‘poor me’ illustration at all, but a positive, inspirational demonstration of how the choices you make to live your life will affect your level of success in managing the condition and finding happiness in your life. Julie is generously giving away her book, Wide Awake and Dreaming: A Memoir of Narcolepsy, for FREE this weekend on Amazon. Julie Flygare was on an ambitious path to success, entering law school at age 22, when narcolepsy destroyed the neurological boundaries between dreaming and reality in her brain. She faced terrifying hallucinations, paralysis and excruciating sleepiness aspects of dream sleep taking place while wide awake. Yet, narcolepsy was a wake-up call for Julie. Her illness propelled her onto a journey she never imagined from lying paralyzed on her apartment\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. by Bloody Disgusting. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

In 1367, James, lord of Piedmont, a cousin of Amadeus, died. There was a dispute over his inheritance between his eldest son, Philip and his widow, Margaret of Beaujeu, representing the interests of her young sons, Amadeus and Louis. In 1383, when her husband, Amadeus VI, died, he left a will granting his wife power over the government of Savoy despite their son, Amadeus VII, being in his early twenties. According to Max Bruchet, one of the fears of the Council in those days was the growing influence of French princes over Savoy: the Duke of Berry had married his daughter to Amadeus VII and his grandson, Amadeus VIII, would one day rule Savoy. The young Amadeus was also betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Philip II, the Duke of Burgundy.

Some critics, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that Vertigo is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the Pygmalion-like obsessions of a man who moulds a woman into the person he desires.

The band's lyrics focus on many different topics based on everyday (namely Tarsus's) life, with songs off of the band's debut EP invoking themes of homelessness, breakups, and financial turmoil. Their sophomore EP Closure focused on such themes as Tarsus's struggle to help his family, emotional claustrophobic towards those new in life and reflecting on the past, while their debut full-length Beyond Repair followed that of numbing oneself via alcohol abuse, the struggle of being an underground musician \n\n The Hook And Pull Gang, Green Telescope and Goodbye Mr Mackenzie enjoying record company interest Mitschell agreed to relocate to Scotland to help push the band forward.

Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. Author Mark Hertsgaard cites the lines \"Why in the world are we here / Surely not to live in pain and fear?\" as a further example of Lennon \"asking what purpose his life on earth was to serve\", after his 1966 composition \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".

While demoing the song on piano in early 1973, with the lyrics still incomplete, he added a few lines from two previously released tracks – \"How? \", from Imagine (1971), and \"God\", from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970). \"Only People\" reflects his \n\n Imagine is the second studio album by English musician John Lennon, released on 9 September 1971 by Apple Records.

Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, Abbey Road Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with supporting musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner.

The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. To date, it is the last studio album Taylor has released, and he has been performing songs form the album on his current concert tour. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released.

It was released by OYOY for digital download and streaming as a single on February 9, 2018. The song was later included on the deluxe edition of Finneas' debut EP, Blood Harmony (2019). An indie pop ballad, the song's lyrics address Finneas breaking up with his girlfriend through on and off texting. An accompanying one-take music video was released on April 18, 2019, and was directed by Sam Bennett. In it, the camera moves around Finneas as he sings about losing his loved one. The video received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised its theme. Finneas performed \"Break My Heart Again\" as part of a 50-minute livestream for Verizon Communications in April 2020. \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" is a song that was written and recorded by American singers Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani for the former's tenth studio album, If I'm Honest (2016). It was released as its second promotional single for digital download on May 9, 2016. The song is Shelton and Stefani's first collaboration. \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with them finding it to be a \"strong\" choice for If I'm Honest. Several other reviewers appreciated Stefani's contributions to the track. The recording's release was accompanied by two live performances of the song later that day on both The Voice and at a promotional iHeartRadio concert. The song features dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love, opening the song with the lines, \"Break a bone, got me on my knees / You break my heart, just to watch it bleed\". Before its release as a single, Ben Norman of About.com noted that the track was \"the obvious follow up to 'Call Me Maybe' although stresses the beats a little more than I'd personally like.\" Jon O'Brien of Allmusic said that both \"Curiosity\" and \"Picture\" are \"convincing forays into infectious synth pop,\" while Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada said that the song is \"still amazingly upbeat.\" Jen Appel of idobi Radio considered \"Curiosity\" similar to \"Call Me Maybe\", adding that the song \"brings the same lighthearted vibe while touching on a more personal note. This song encompasses the feelings of a girl fighting to keep her relationship alive while struggling with the ever-present curiosity of 'what ifs'.\" Adele explained that the song was not inspired by the media, but was aimed at her own friends, who frequently spread rumours about her break-up with her boyfriend: \"People might think it's about blogs and magazines and papers, but it's not. It's about my own friends believing stuff that they hear about me, which is pretty mortifying really.\" Adele said that \"Rumour Has It\" and \"Rolling in the Deep\" were lyrically opposite of \"Someone like\n\nQuestion: Which song was released more recently, Go Ahead And Break My Heart or Knee Deep In My Heart?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Another was Princess Gabrielle who married \n\n She was born in Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, the youngest child of Giovanni Battista Vercellana and his wife, Maria Teresa Griglio. As her sister agreed to travel with her, Maria Anna duly married on 16 November 1817 the future Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, son of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his first wife Princess Luisa of Naples and Sicily. During the celebrations, Ferdinand became attached to Maria Anna's sister, and they were later married. They had four children:  After Maria Anna's death at Pisa in 1832, her husband married Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies. Her mother was a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg and was a sister of the late Queen Polyxena of Sardinia, wife of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. As such, Charles Emmanuel's children were Leopoldina's first cousins including the future King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia. In 1753, he was engaged to Maria Beatrice d'Este, heiress to the Duchy of Modena. The marriage was never consummated and Maria Beatrice instead married Leopold's brother, Archduke Ferdinand. Upon the early death of his older brother Archduke Charles in 1761, the family decided that Leopold was going to succeed his father as Duke of Tuscany.

Her film debut was a small part, in the role of a prostitute in Santa (1930), the first talkie of Mexican cinema. Subsequently she performed with Mario Moreno Cantinflas in the popular film Ahí está el detalle (1940). In the 1940s, Álvarez is characterized by her interpretation of elegant ladies in films like El sombrero de tres picos and México de mis recuerdos (1943). She performed with the popular Pedro Infante in three films: Si me han de matar mañana (1946), La barca de oro (1947) and Soy charro de Rancho Grande (1947). One of her most celebrated films was La Reina de la Opereta (1945). In 1999, she participated in the Mexican movie Sexo, pudor y lagrimas (directed by Antonio Serrano) for which she won the Silver Ariel Award as Best Actress. In 2011, Zabaleta debuted as host of her own TV show, Susana Adicción, on the Mexico's Unicable network. Both Buñuel and Matouk were so impressed by young Carajas Sandoval's hard and efficient work that she became the most important person in Matouk's team who immediately signed her as her principal executive producer. \"Movies are magical, they can make you dream, they can make you laugh or cry or even take you into the future or the past, the movie industry is undoubtedly the ultimate dream factory\" Along her career, \n\n Carmen- I work for art.

Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.\" Ebert also described the way it makes a connection between Ritz Crackers and the Ritz-Carlton hotel (which reveals that Henry's affair had in fact been deeply embedded in his apparently lost memories) as \"especially annoying\", apparently regarding it as comic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" Variety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a \"Rotten\" 43% rating based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.

Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" Variety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a \"Rotten\" 43% rating based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.

Contrary to the prevalent uses in modern progressive metal and djent, Tor Oddmund Suhrke's playing style includes the use of complex chords in a variety of alternate guitar tunings (often necessitated by the fact the chord progressions are originally written by Einar Solberg on keyboard).

The sphenoid is a sinus. These sinuses serve many purposes. The sphenoid bone is one of seven bones that forms the base of the cranium. Why is a fracture of the sphenoid bone so serious? Our brains have a strong structure of bones to protect it. It is also important to keep in the mind that to suffer a sphenoid bone fracture the patient most likely had a significant blow to the head. How is a sphenoid bone fracture diagnosed? A cerebral blood flow study might also indicate the possibility of a fracture. Below are recent settlements and verdicts in cases involving a sphenoid injury. This case involved a head-on collision. She was hospitalized for seven days after suffering a basilar skull fracture, temporal bone fracture, fracture of the sphenoid sinus and subdural hematoma. The plaintiff initially had double vision and a hearing loss but, thankfully, these problems resolved. Her medical bills and lost wages were light for such an injury: a $2,907 wage loss and $34,539 in medical bills. Plaintiff sued every in sight: the driver, the owner of the car, residential property owners who shared the driveway where the ice was located, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The argument there was a tough one: the road was negligently designed to because it easily allowed surface water to gather to form ice. The young girl suffered a traumatic intracranial hematoma and a sphenoid sinus fracture. She had some brain damage and hearing loss. Her medical bills were approximately $350,000. 2015, California: $17,393,480 Verdict. The victim was ambulatory and self-extricated at the scene. He did not lose consciousness. But he suffered jaw fractures and right maxillary sinus and right sphenoid lateral pterygoid fractures. He even got married. The jury obviously agreed. The rush is because there is a limited window to both collect evidence to bring a claim. We can help you and no cost or obligation. Disfigurement. Many victims are left with scars after a dog bite incident. These surgeries almost always result in scars, and can be devastating if they occur on a child’s face. A childhood encounter with a dangerous dog could result in disfigurement that lasts for the rest of a person’s life. Emotional injuries. There may be long-lasting emotional or psychological trauma, such as a fear of dogs, fear of going outside, or even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for victims who cannot cope with the emotional pain of the incident. If a victim has suffered scarring, he is more likely to suffer psychological effects, as he must look at a physical reminder of the pain every day. Infections. Death. Victims often rely on their own medical insurance to pay for the costs of treatment after a dog attack. If a dog owner did not take proper precautions to protect innocent people from harm, the owner can be held liable for any injuries the dog causes. Which Injuries Are the Biggest Threat to Motorcycle Riders? Head injuries. Neck injuries. Road rash. When a biker has to swerve to avoid a crash or “lay down” the bike, he or she may suffer “road rash”—scraping one or more parts of the body along the pavement. Foot and leg fractures. In severe cases, riders may suffer a laceration to the leg that requires amputation to stop the bleeding. Arm injuries. Torso and pelvis trauma. Fractured ribs can also be painful, and have the added risk of causing organ perforation or internal bleeding. Is There a Way I Can Prevent These Injuries? Perhaps the most important thing is to practice safe riding: no drinking, no risky maneuvers, and limited riding after dark. At the end of the day, you can’t control others’ actions. Cell phone use. Civil penalties. Violators can be stuck with fines and penalties up to\n\n that wind through Honduras, and it's often difficult to see pedestrians.\" The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by a van driven by Stephanie, Lopes' personal assistant.

Everardus Bogardus the second minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, the oldest established church in present-day New York, frequently was combative with the Director-General of the New Netherlands and their management of the Dutch West India Company colony, going up against the often-drunk Wouter van Twiller and famously denouncing Willem Kieft from the pulpit during the colony's disastrously bloody Kieft's War (1643–1645).

He earned a BA in biology with major in biochemistry from Yale University. Persuaded by Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr., he joined Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine for an MD-PhD course. Upon his retirement in 2009, he was appointed chief scientific officer of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. For his works, he received the Canada Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1984, Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1989, in addition to Nobel Prize. His parents were Mabel (Schmidt) and Alfred Gilman, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine and one of the authors of the classic pharmacology textbook Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (nicknamed the \"Blue Bible\" of pharmacology). His middle name was in honor of the co-author Louis S. Goodman. His friend Michael Stuart Brown (who was also born in 1941, and later the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate) joked that Gilman was \"probably the only person who was ever named after a textboook.\" He grew up in White Plains, New York, while his father worked at Columbia University and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Education Gilman attended local elementary school in White Plains. He studied science at Yale University. He worked in the laboratory of Melvin Simpson, where he met his future wife Kathryn Hedlund. He graduated in 1962 receiving a BA in biology with major in biochemistry. He then entered a combined MD-PhD program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio where he wanted to study under Nobel laureate pharmacologist Earl Sutherland, who was a close friend of his father. However, Sutherland was departing for Vanderbilt University, so Gilman studied with Sutherland's collaborator, Theodore Rall. Gilman graduated from Case Western in 1969, then did his post-doctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health with Nobel laureate Marshall Nirenberg from 1969 to 1971. In 2005, he was appointed director of the drug company, Eli Lilly & Co. Death Gilman died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer in Dallas, Texas on December 23, 2015 at the age of 74. He was survived by his wife and three children, Amy Ariagno and Anne Sincovec, both of Dallas, and Edward Gilman of Austin. This was due to loss of proteins in these cancer cells.

In 1994 Gonzalez was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \"departing from accepted practice\". Biography\nGonzalez was born December 28, 1947 in Flushing, New York. From 1970–1977, Gonzalez worked as a journalist for Time Inc. and as a freelance writer, covering a variety of health-related topics, including a July 1972 cover story in New York Magazine, a 1976 cover story for Family Health Magazine, and an article for Prevention Magazine. Gonzalez became interested in medical research, cancer research in particular, while covering these topics.

Gonzalez has been characterized as a quack and fraud by other doctors and health fraud watchdog groups, and in 1994 was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \"departing from accepted practice\". Forced to submit to psychological examinations and undergo retraining, Gonzalez was given two years of probation with a stipulation that he undergo retraining and do 200 hours of community service, which he completed satisfactorily. Gonzalez lost two malpractice lawsuits. In 1997, a New York court found Gonzalez \"negligent\" for his cancer treatment; according to news reports, Gonzalez \"had to pay $2.5 million in damages to a patient he wrongly claimed to have cured\" of cancer. The patient had refused both standard treatment and an experimental protocol, but after the cancer spread to her spine, she discontinued Gonzalez's treatment and received chemotherapy and external beam radiation. Sometime in this period, she began having problems with her eyesight, back and hip, and she eventually became blind. In 2000, Gonzalez was found partly liable (49%) in the death of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma and ordered to pay $282,000 in damages, due to his use of an unproven cancer screening method instead of standard cancer testing. An accompanying editorial said it was troubling that expensive CAM therapies were not backed by firm evidence, and that the trial of the Gonzalez regimen was not capable of providing a definitive conclusion because of flaws in its design. Kimball Atwood said that flaws in the trial design might have led to bias in favor of the Gonzalez regimen but that it nevertheless amounted to \"a slam-dunk condemnation\" of the therapy.

Campgrounds operated by the U.S. Forest Service close in the winter months, with the exception of Dripping Springs near Dutch John. The many available fish species in the reservoir and surrounding lakes are Colorado River Cutthroat trout, Brown trout, Rainbow trout , Lake trout, Kokanee salmon, Smallmouth bass, Burbot and Common carp. The lake is classified as a coldwater fishery, with observed species including rainbow trout, brown trout, landlocked salmon, lake trout, and chain pickerel. Walleye, small and largemouth bass, crappie, northern pike, and many species of panfish make the area's lakes famous for freshwater fishing. The beauty, heritage, and recreational opportunities of these forests draw thousands of tourists to the Chequamegon–Nicolet area every year. Clam Lake in Chequamegon National Forest was also home to one of the two extremely low frequency antennae in the United States. Caples lake is found in the Eldorado National Forest so there are a variety of different recreational opportunities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing within close proximity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has reports of stocking Caples lake with fish for recreational fishing dating back to 1930. Both the CDFW and the EID stock Caples lake with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Caples lake also supports a few non-stocked species such as the Lahontan redsides (Richardsonius egregius), the tui chub (Gila bicolor), and the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). There is year-round fishing at Caples lake, boat access in the summer and ice-fishing in the winter.

The film is based on the life of Evan Perry, who experienced bipolar depression from a young age. The documentary was filmed throughout Evan's life, because whenever his parents, Dana and Hart Perry, consulted a psychiatrist about Evan's suicidal comments or other signs of mental illness, the psychiatrists did not believe that their son was depressed. The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed. Evan was diagnosed with depression at age 5, and he was later diagnosed with bipolar depression. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him. The teacher told his parents, and Hart and Dana Perry took him to see a therapist. Dana Perry, a professional filmmaker, knew that psychiatrists would not believe everything she told them about her son. At this point, she decided to film as much as she could from Evan's life, especially when he talked about suicide. Evan was very much into filming, just like his parents. Middle childhood When Evan was 10 years old he started attending Pk Yonge School and made his first attempt to commit suicide. When his parents picked him up, they went straight to the Four Winds which is a mental institution. His whole stay there, Evan kept saying that he simply did it for attention, however they knew it was just his way of getting the attention off of him. At Wellspring he ran away his first night, but eventually he gave in and let himself get help. His family also went to Wellspring for family therapy, so that they could all learn to communicate and understand Evan. He seemed to be getting better, he seemed healthier and happier so he was taken out of Wellspring and was sent to York prep school. Adolescence At this school Evan became very involved, he made many friends and he would go out and have fun. Evan had jumped out his window and left a numbered list of reasons to live and die for, then deciding that dying was his solution. Hart did everything he could to make Evan happy, he would film with him, he would go to therapy with Evan, and he was very supportive. Dana Perry (mother) Evan's mother was equally supportive of Evan, and it was her idea to film everything going on in Evan's life so that therapists would believe her and would have a better idea of what is going on. When Evan was five years old he actually explained to his mother how he was going to commit suicide, very detailed as well. Throughout the documentary, Nicholas explained how most of the songs Evan wrote were very relatable for someone Nick's age. Nicholas was more than 5 years older than Evan, so while Evan was 7 years old, writing songs about his inner pain and demons in his head, Nicholas was in high school and experiencing this. Nicholas along with every teenager feels this at one point or another, Evan just felt it to a different intensity. Production The film was made by the boy's parents, director Dana Perry and cinematographer Hart Perry.

Additionally, the editorial world allowed Foster to recognize the significance of telling stories through cinematic work—this led him to a career shift into filmmaking.

It was also the only installment of the franchise that did not feature François Berléand. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a box office success, grossing $72 million worldwide against production budget of $22 million. In 1936, The Daily Express wrote, \"In spite of its laudable effort to put more action into a fairly static play, the film script is a rare triumph of unimaginativeness.\" We can think of two dozen British pictures such as The Ghost Goes West, South Riding, To the Victor and Drums, not to mention the Hitchcock classics, which most certainly retain their appeal.

Dr. Raymundo Favila was elected as Academician of the National Academy of Science and Technology in 1979. He was one of those who initiated mathematics in the Philippines. He contributed extensively to the progression of mathematics and the mathematics learning in the country. He was invited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Edinburgh in 1958 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. This led to a correspondence and eventually Weil invited Matsusaka to the University of Chicago (1954–57) where they became life-long friends. Matsusaka was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1959–1960. Alexander Grothendieck (28 March 1928 – 13 November 2014) was a mathematician who became the leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of commutative algebra, homological algebra, sheaf theory and category theory to its foundations, while his so-called \"relative\" perspective led to revolutionary advances in many areas of pure mathematics. Born in Germany, Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in France, and he and his family were persecuted by the Nazi regime. For much of his working life, however, he was, in effect, stateless. As he consistently spelled his first name \"Alexander\" rather than \"Alexandre\" and his surname, taken from his mother, was the Dutch-like Low German \"Grothendieck\", he was \n\n After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at University of Cambridge in 2009, Maynard obtained his D.Phil. from University of Oxford at Balliol College in 2013 under the supervision of Roger Heath-Brown.\n\nQuestion: Who died later, Narcís Ventalló or H.

He is known for his research on the role of genetics in sexual orientation and for a series of popular books and documentaries that have changed the understanding and perceptions of human sexuality and gender identity. Education and career Born in Montclair, New Jersey, Hamer obtained his BA at Trinity College, CT, and his PhD from Harvard Medical School. Human sexual orientation and behavior genetics In the 1990s Hamer began studies on the genetics of human behavior, which led to the first molecular evidence for genes that influence human sexual orientation. His research group's first paper, published in Science in 1993, reported that the maternal but not paternal male relatives of gay men had increased rates of same-sex orientation, suggesting the possibility of sex-linked transmission in a portion of the population. In 2004, Hamer used data from ongoing behavioral genetics studies in his lab to explore the possibility of genetic influences on spirituality. In The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes, he proposed that a quantitative measure of self-transcendence is partially heritable and may be correlated to a specific gene, VMAT2, involved in monamine metabolism. HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention Hamer's lab developed several biotechnological strategies to treat and reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Films and media Hamer turned to documentary filmmaking to address complex scientific and social issues often overlooked by the mainstream media. In 2005, he and partner Joe Wilson formed Qwaves with the mission of producing \"insightful and provocative films that emanate from the voices of those on the outside and compel us to question and to act.\" Their short films won multiple awards including winner of the PBS Independent Lens Shorts Festival and Seeds of Tolerance Award. Out in the Silence, the first feature film from Qwaves, documented the controversy that was ignited by Hamer and Wilson's wedding announcement in Wilson's conservative small hometown in Pennsylvania. The film was supported by the Sundance Documentary Film Program and won an Emmy Award for achievement in documentary. In 2011, Hamer and Wilson moved to Hawaiʻi to begin a series of films about Pacific Islander lives and voices and long tradition of acceptance of sexual and gender minorities. Their feature documentary Kumu Hina, about transgender native Hawaiian teacher and cultural icon Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, was supported by ITVS, Pacific Islanders in Communications and the Ford Foundation and won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary and the Independent Lens Audience Award on PBS. In 2017, Hamer and Wilson, with Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu as producer, released Leitis in Waiting and Lady Eva, which documented the lives of transgender women in the conservative South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga. This was followed in 2019 by The Rogers, about transgender men in Samoa. These films became part of a campaign to decriminalize same-sex relationships across the Pacific. Hamer, Wilson and Wong-Kalu continued their collaboration in 2020 with the animated short film Kapaemahu, based on the hidden history of four stones on Waikiki Beach placed there as a tribute to four legendary mahu who first brought the healing arts from Tahiti to Hawaii. It premiered and won the Special Jury Prize at the Tribeca Film Festival and was shortlisted for an Oscar as Best Animated Short Film at the 93rd Academy Awards. Hamer is a frequent guest on TV documentaries and news shows including Good Morning America, Nightline and The Oprah Winfrey Show. He is featured in the Barbara Walters' special Heaven and Bill Maher documentary Religulous, and has been profiled in Time magazine.

This occurred just a few months prior to his graduation from West Seneca West Senior High School (WSW) in 2009. The book's title is a reference to Faulkner being named \"Most Likely to Succeed\" by his high school graduating class shortly before the accident. The book details Faulkner's life leading up to the accident, including his family life and having earned a place in the top ten percent of his high school graduating class, as well as admission to the all-college honors program at Canisius College[1]. The book closes with a personal note from Faulkner about his aspirations for a new approach to TBI rehabilitation, including \"our society to reach some type of recognition that brain injury does happen, and that we need to do more for the victims, especially the young people who suffer from such an awful occurrence.\" The documentary film, which also documents Faulkner's accident, TBI and life after, was first test screened in Buffalo, New York in 2013, applied to film festivals in 2014, premiered at a film festival in 2015, and became publicly available in 2016. Recovery was directed and produced by Ryan Monolopolus, who also graduated from WSW alongside Faulkner and remained friends with him following high school. Monolopolus was interviewed by the West Seneca Central School District for their Spring 2017 newsletter, and indicated that the film's debut screening at UB was \"the largest screening for a student work ever at UB.\" According to Monolopolus' resume, the film was allegedly selected as the \"Best Documentary\" at the \"Speak Here, First\" film festival in 2015, although no other reference to this can be found. According to Monolopolus' website, Recovery was shot in collaboration with Mercy Flight and Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), and includes footage of a reenacted helicopter flight to ECMC, giving a portrayal of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) air transport that was available to Faulkner to rush him to the hospital. The film had an approximate budget of $15,000. Kirchmyer and Faulkner held several book signings after the initial release, notably one with a screening of the documentary film, Recovery at Canisius College in Regis North. Community Engagement Prior to the release of the book and documentary film, Faulkner was interviewed by Melissa Holmes of WGRZ, a local news station in Buffalo, NY. Holmes interviewed both Faulkner and Monolopolus for the TV news feature in the Canisius College library. Monolopolus told Holmes that \"Matt's recovery can be used as an example of how people move forward in multiple calibers. In describing the experience and how the book and documentary could have an impact on others, Faulkner said that he hopes other people \"...can get inspiration to know that what they think may be impossible could very well be possible.\" Since the release of the book and documentary, Faulkner has spoken publicly on the topics of TBI, rehabilitation, motivation and recovery. In 2014, Monolopolus produced several TV ad spots for Mercy Flight, including one which featured Faulkner describing his accident and the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) service provided by Mercy Flight. In December 2020, Faulkner was recorded for two videos for the Brainwaves Video Anthology channel on YouTube. In the videos, Faulkner shared his story, and how he hopes to have an impact on the lives of others, just as so many others helped him. The nightmare was real.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

From 1941 to 1946, he mainly worked for Warner Bros. His first film at Warner was The Maltese Falcon (1941), the first of many films in which he appeared alongside actors Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet. This was followed by Casablanca (1942), the second of the nine films in which Lorre and Greenstreet appeared together. Lorre's other films include Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954). He frequently produced short travel documentary subjects, including some entries in the \"Vagabond Adventure\" travelogue series for Pathé Exchange and RKO Pictures in the early 1930s. Mel Dinelli, who had written The Spiral Staircase for RKO production chief Dore Schary, adapted the story for the screen and the movie was given the title of The Window. Ted Tetzlaff was given the job of directing. Ullman wanted to use a semi-documentary style as he came from that background. He was a founding member of the Screen Directors Guild when it was established in 1936, and served as its first Executive Secretary, until he was replaced by Jack McGowan in 1938.

Soon, the townsmen of King's Lynn seized Robert Dudley and the rest of his small troop and sent him to Framlingham Castle before Mary I. Robert Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London, attainted, \n\n condemned to death, as were his father and four brothers. In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in a tournament held to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship. The land passed to John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, in 1511, who was later executed by Queen Mary, and his son Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, was a favourite of Elizabeth I.

Dudley's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father, The 1st Duke of Northumberland, had failed to prevent the accession of Mary I. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin under Mary's husband and co-ruler, Philip, which led to his full rehabilitation.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album.

Catherine de' Medici brought him back to Paris, where he was reconciled to his brother, King Henry III of France, in February 1584. Henry even embraced his brother, whom he had famously called le petit magot (\"little macaque\"). His premature death meant that the Huguenot Henry of Navarre became heir-presumptive, thus leading to an escalation in the French Wars of Religion. In 1723 Anne Charlotte's father, Léopold, disappointed with his relations with France, decided to send his heir to finish his education in Vienna under the supervision of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Anne Charlotte's younger sister Marie Louise also died on the same day.

His elementary education started in a comprehensive primary school at Longlier, his birthplace. He served in the British Intelligence Service during the First World War, and got imprisoned in concentration camps twice. In recognition of his service, he was granted enrolment at the University of Liège in Belgium to study medicine without any formal education required for the course. His collective works established the complex functional and structural properties of cells. Claude served as director at Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment and Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cancérologie in Louvain-la-Neuve ; Professor at the Free University of Brussels, the University of Louvain, and Rockefeller University. Early life and education Albert Claude was born in 1899 (but according to civil register 1898) in Longlier, a hamlet in Neufchâteau, Belgium, to Florentin Joseph Claude and Marie-Glaudice Watriquant Claude. His father was a Paris-trained baker and run a bakery-cum-general store at Longlier valley near railroad station. He started education in Longlier Primary School, a pluralistic school of single room, mixed grades, and all under one teacher. Due to economic depression the family moved to Athus, a prosperous region with steel mills, in 1907. After two years he was asked to look after his uncle who was disabled with cerebral haemorrhage in Longlier. At the outbreak of the First World War he was apprenticed to steel mills and worked as an industrial designer. Inspired by Winston Churchill, then British Minister of War, he joined the resistance and volunteered in British Intelligence Service in which he served during the whole war. Since he had no formal secondary education, particularly required for medicine course, such as in Greek and Latin, he tried to join School of Mining in Liège. As an honour to his war service, he was given admission to the University of Liège in 1922 to study medicine. Back in Belgium he received fellowship in 1929 from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (Commission for Relief in Belgium, CRB) for research in the United States. In 1938 he identified and purified for the first time component of Rous sarcoma virus, the causal agent of carcinoma, as \"ribose nucleoprotein\" (eventually named RNA). In the mid sixties during an Electron Microscopy symposium in (Bratislava)-(Czechoslovakia) organized by the (UNESCO) at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he meets young scientist Dr. Emil Mrena who was at that time head of the Electron Microscopy department. He invited him to come and work with him in Brussels, making it possible for Dr. Mrena's family to escape the communist regime. Their close collaboration gave fruition to 5 publications from 1969 to 1974. With the support of his colleague and friend Christian de Duve, he became in 1972 Professor at the University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain) and Director of the \"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cancérologie\" in Louvain-la-Neuve where he moved with Dr. Emil Mrena as sole collaborator. Personal life He married Julia Gilder in 1935, with whom he had a daughter Philippa. Claude was known to be a bit of an eccentric and had close friendship with painters, including Diego Rivera and Paul Delvaux, and musicians such as Edgard Varèse. After his retirement in 1971 from the Université libre de Bruxelles and from the directorship of the Institut Jules Bordet, he continued his research at the University of Louvain with his collaborator Dr. Emil Mrena, who ended up resigning in 1977 due to decreasing activity of the Laboratory, moving to other research works. It is said that he continued his research in seclusion until he died of natural causes, at his home in Brussels, on Sunday night on 22 May 1983, but he had stopped visiting his own laboratory in Louvain already in 1976 due to his weak health.

She then played Janet Smith, the young sister of Ann Todd, in the David Lean film Madeleine (1950). Stranks played a young student in the crime drama Sapphire (1959), and had a small part as a schoolgirl in the train scenes of The 39 Steps (also 1959) starring Kenneth More. She then appeared as a regular panelist on the TV pop music show Juke Box Jury as well as Emergency - Ward 10 but she is best known for the children's TV series Magpie, which she co-presented from 1968 to 1974. Following Magpie, Stranks devised and presented a programme for pre-school children, named Paperplay, which ran until 1981. As described in a review in a film magazine, Carlyle (Lowe), a wealthy young Englishman buys a debt-ridden estate from Lord Mount-Severn (Mayne) and persuade his daughter, Lady Isabel (Rubens), to marry him though she loves the rascally Sir Francis (Tellegen). A villager, the father of a wayward girl, is murdered and Richard (Fenton), the brother of Carlyle's former sweetheart Barbara (Daw), is accused. Lady Isabel learns that her oldest child is ill and, posing as a nurse, goes to him and nurses him to health. Lisa and Jongman arrive at Tangiers, where they meet a Dutch smuggler named Klaus Van der Pink (Hugh Griffith), but his price to arrange passage to Palestine is too high. Jongman declares his feelings for Lisa but she rejects him because she feels incapable of being a wife or a mother due to her Auschwitz medical experimentation, the effect of which on her reproductive organs she is uncertain about. Her lawyer has difficulty in obtaining a suitable young man when Dorothy mistakes Don Morton (Fellowes), a law student working in the office, for an applicant and a wedding is arranged. Smith's story was the basis for several plays including the distinguished David Lean film Madeleine (1950), starring Ann Todd, Ivan Desny and Leslie Banks. A television play based upon the case, Killer in Close-Up: The Trial Of Madeleine Smith, written by George F.

The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. At the hospital, the doctor informs Sara and Brian that Anna is brain-dead and says that they will need to act quickly if they wish to donate her organs. An injured Campbell approves the procedure and Kate's life is saved. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. She tries her hardest to keep her oldest, ill, daughter alive and well. Sara refuses to accept the idea that Kate is likely to die, and in doing so she neglects the needs of her two other children, whom she keeps seeing in relation to Kate. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. He is fond of astronomy and becomes torn between his daughters, and his wife, during Anna's emancipation trial. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. After Anna's death, he too needs a lot of time to cope with it. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. He personally uses a service dog, which others find mysterious, because he does not tell anyone why. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet.

Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia.

Like the homeless man with diabetic vascular disease whose blood flow was so poor that maggots were feeding off the decaying tissue in his feet. De Villa’s eyes well up at the memories. Decades later, de Villa now has a vastly expanded role: As the city’s new medical officer of health, she is responsible for the well-being of 2.8 million Torontonians. De Villa took over Canada’s largest municipal public health unit in late March. But she hasn’t forgotten the lessons learned as a University of Toronto med student: that an individual’s health can be determined by their social circumstances. It is a notion that echoes the values imbued in her as a child. Although de Villa had a privileged upbringing, her parents — Toronto cardiologist Dr. Maria Antonina “Nenette” de Villa, and her late father, Dr. Guillermo “Jun” de Villa, an obstetrician/gynecologist — drilled into her and brother Joey the importance of helping the less fortunate. “I was raised in a household where the general teaching was, ‘You’ve been a very fortunate person; you’ve been afforded a great opportunity.’ And the expectation is to give back,” de Villa says during an interview at Toronto Public Health headquarters near Yonge and Dundas Sts. Her childhood was filled with lively dinner table discussions about political tumult in the Philippines, the birthplace of her parents and older brother. Although de Villa was born in Boston — her parents had travelled to the U.S. for their medical residencies — the family returned to the Philippines in 1972. Her father had a large extended family there and wanted his kids to think of the country as home. In 1975, with the Philippines under martial law and the iron-fist rule of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the de Villas fled to Canada. In Toronto, the de Villas became prominent members of the Filipino community. De Villa’s father joined a local anti-Marcos group in 1983 following the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. “These issues in the Philippines were front and centre in the minds of people here,” de Villa recalls. By the early 1990s, de Villa’s mind was on her own career. She had completed a bachelor of science at McGill University, but the next step weighed heavily on her. De Villa applied and got one in Vienna with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, which supports developing countries. “So I ended up with this wonderful blend of medical, health care and health system-related (knowledge) along with political and public policy aspects — which at the end of the day is public health,” says de Villa. That’s where de Villa first met the woman who would become a role model: Dr. Sheela Basrur, Toronto’s medical officer of health at the time. De Villa witnessed Basrur’s leadership during both the garbage strike in the summer of 2002 and the SARS crisis in the spring/summer of 2003. During the labour dispute, Basrur and her staff ordered cleanups when illegal dumping in public parks prompted concerns about rat infestations. During the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak — which killed 44 people in Canada and forced the quarantine of 25,000 Torontonians — Basrur became known for her highly visible leadership, her steady decision making and her calm, reassuring messaging. Basrur, who died in 2008 of a rare form of cancer, was a “master” at finding that balance, says de Villa. Her file included medical consultation, vaccination and prevention and control of communicable diseases such as TB, STDs and blood-borne infections. It is a kindness she inherited from her father, Guillermo, who was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for his contributions to public life. When he died in 2006 at age 67, those gathered at his funeral heard that Guillermo never wanted his family wealth to stand out. Although his family could afford to buy him proper shoes for school, he refused to wear them, “not wanting to appear snobbish or spoiled,” his son Joey said at the service, according to local Filipino newspaper Filipiniana. And so his spirit lives on, not only in de Villa’s professional life, but her personal one as well. Carolyn Hammond, a close friend of de Villa’s for 10 years, describes her as calm, level-headed and approachable. As an example, Hammond, a wine columnist for the Star, recalls the time she and de Villa were downtown chatting over cheesecake and latte. A stranger sitting beside de Villa said hello to her in French, not knowing if she could speak the language. She can, and the two launched into a conversation in which the man explained he was a visitor from the Ivory Coast. De Villa “just has this incredible openness to everyone,” says Hammond. De Villa’s openness extends to those in her west-end neighbourhood, including an elderly couple who live next door with their 60-year-old son, who is blind and mentally challenged. For many years, the couple was a huge support to de Villa, her husband and sons. “They were superb gardeners. I’m now better able to provide them with support and assistance, and I do,’’ de Villa explains, adding others in the neighbourhood pitch in as well. “They’re an extended branch of my family,” de Villa says. The couple’s older son, who doesn’t live at home and asked that the family not be identified, said his dad is 93 and his 89-year-old mom has mobility issues. The plan is to have his parents and younger brother stay in their home as long as possible, and the support from de Villa is helping make that happen. It’s an example of the “engaged citizen” de Villa aims to be. De Villa, who made $290,104 in 2016 as Peel Region’s medical officer of health, according to the Sunshine List, took over the Toronto position in March after Dr. David McKeown retired last summer.\n\nQuestion: Which country Tivala's father is from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Once in Yangon, I simply booked a flight to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, an uneventful 50 min flight away. Arriving after midday in Sittwe, I walked through a lazy sea-side town, where various hotel staff tried to charge me 150 dollars for a private boat or car to Mrauk U, the remote temple sight and main touristic draw of the Rakhine State. I politely declined, walked to the bus station, and arrived in Mrauk U after 5-hour drive in the back of a local pickup, crammed with locals who eagerly touched my skin, impressed with how white it was. Mrauk U is the name of both a village with about 50.000 inhabitants and a wide-spread temple. Still off the beaten track, being occasionally deemed off limits to tourists depending on the political situation in Rakhine, and with locals still living between the ruins as they did 40 years ago in Bagan. Considering that I had read that the Rohingyas of Mrauk U had been expelled to a camp approximately 8 km south of town, I silently wondered but left the subject. However somehow there seems to be more to this story. I asked again about the Rohingya. I was told that all the tourists asked about them, and many had decided against coming due to the perceived unrest (and to the British Foreign Secretary´s general advice against all non-essential travel to Mrauk U). To the ordinary tourist in this area the Rohingya are invisible and those locals involved in tourism tries their best to make them stay that way, knowing well that travel restrictions to this part of Rakhine State will severely impact their business. All seemed to follow the same itinerary during the allowed 14 days visit: Yangon-Mandalay-Bagan-Inle Lake-Yangon. In 2017, I mainly returned to see those parts of the country, which were not open to tourists in 1996: Mrauk U and surroundings in Rakhine. Hsipaw (and the hill tribes) as well as walking from Kalaw to Inle Lake. Considering all tourists spend at least a day here, Yangon seems relatively free from tourists. Mandalay is as wide-spread as I remember it and the tourists do not seem to take up much space. The obvious thing to do is to visit Sagaing, Mingun and perhaps Innwa on a day-trip. Although Hsipaw is now on the tourist trail, it is by no means overcrowded. Almost no English is spoken here, however a small bakery right next to the market served the best caffé latte I had on my entire trip. The Pindaya Caves are a highlight of any visit to Myanmar and the hike up to Yazegui village is lovely. Kalaw village really is not much of a place to visit, the attractions are the hills outside town. Walking from Kalaw to Inle Lake was another highlight of the trip and described in a separate post. Inle Lake has also developed into something of a tourist trap: Thousands of boats ply the lack, hundreds of craft-shops are set up for tourists around the lake and the former stilt-town of Nyaungschwe has developed into a nightmare of concrete and construction. At the far Southern end of Inle Lake, where fewer tourists come, more authentic villages may be visited. The beach itself is great, lined with small shops selling grilled fish as well as big resorts. Again, the plane takes less than 1\n\n  The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance. EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece. By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES had roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA had under 10,000 men. To combat the rising influence of the EAM, and fearful of an eventual takeover after the German defeat, in 1943, Ioannis Rallis, the Prime Minister of the collaborationist government, authorised the creation of paramilitary forces, known as the Security Battalions. There are also small hotels, for example the Hotel Terra Mare with several acres of associated grounds in which holiday bungalows are set. Taverna Angelos is renowned for its pizzas, is situated on the main street. Another Taverna, Pharos, can be found by turning up a side road off the west side of the main street. The nearest shops are back south on the main road towards Lixouri, 25 minutes to walk but five minutes in a car.

It is about 8.5 km SW of the prefecture's capital, Amfissa, to which it is connected by the recently reconstructed GR-48. Agia Efthymia is also close to some popular destinations of Greek and foreign travellers: the famous archeological site of Delphi, the coastal towns Itea and Galaxidi, Parnassos Ski Center. The residents engages mainly in agriculture, with products like the popular olives of the region, pastoralism, building, while many of them work in the bauxite mines. During the 19th and 20th century, Agia Efthymia was one of the largest villages in Parnassida and the whole of Phocis. Now the population of the village has reduced to 597 residents according to the census of 2001, although the people originating from it who visit and live there during the year, especially in summer, increase the number to more than 1,000. Archeological finds from this period, such as the marble torso of a male statue, are housed at the Archaeological Museum of Florina. There were 132 Christian households in the village in the first half of the 17th century. According to local tradition, the settlers who laid the foundation of the modern village included various people from the region such as Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks, etc. There were two Bulgarian schools in the beginning of 20th century. In 1913, with the conditions of the Treaty of Bucharest, when this part of Macedonia became part of Greece, and after the Balkan Wars, a lot of locals emigrated to Bulgaria. The village was renamed Vevi in 1926. Following World War II as well as the Greek Civil War it saw more exodus on the part of the town's non-Greek inhabitants.\n\nQuestion: Are both villages, Mavrolithari and Ampelakia, Evros, located in the same country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sterling. The magazine was progressive and ran from 1923 to 1927. In 1891, she published Manners and Habits, a book in Arabic. She went on a lecture tour in the United States after her Chicago activities were finished. This seemed an especially acute issue given that the subjects of the statue, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, were co-editors of the first few volumes of The History of Woman Suffrage, a six-part history of the women's suffrage movement that, some scholars and journalists \n\n History of Woman Suffrage is a book that was produced by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Ida Husted Harper. Published in six volumes from 1881 to 1922, it is a history of the women's suffrage movement, primarily in the United States. Its more than 5700 pages are the major source for primary documentation about the women's suffrage movement from its beginnings through the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which enfranchised women in the U.S. in 1920. Realizing that the project was unlikely to make a profit, Anthony used money from a bequest in 1885 to buy the rights from the other authors and also the plates from the publisher of the two volumes that had already been issued. As sole owner, she published the books herself and donated many copies to libraries and people of influence. In her will, Anthony bequeathed the plates for all the volumes together with the existing inventory to the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nQuestion: When was the company that published Woman'S Century founded?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, such as Hot Chip, Lea Salonga, Seether, and the Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys. \"Amaze Me\" is a song performed by all-female German pop group No Angels. Lyrically, \"Amaze Me\" is an ode to love. It was composed by A.B. Selena included it on the album to help her cross over into the English-speaking market. Critics praised her emotive enunciation in the song. After Selena was murdered in 1995, a remix version by R&B group Full Force appeared on her fifth studio album Dreaming of You, which was originally intended to be her full-length English-language debut album. The lyrics describe the love felt by the narrator, who reminisces of rhapsodic events she has shared with her lover. In some parts of the song, the narrator experiences loneliness and anguish because of the absence of her boyfriend. Although never intended to be released as a single, the track peaked at number 22 on the US Rhythmic Top 40 chart in 1995 after Selena's death.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres.

The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. Plot Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. While driving back home, the boys get into a car accident, in which Christophe and Johan are only mildly injured while Simon experiences severe bodily trauma and immediately slips into a coma. It is soon determined that Christophe and Johan were wearing seat belts, while Simon was not. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. Révol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. Ultimately, Marianne and Sean permit Simon's heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys to be donated, but are unswerving in their prohibition of donating his eyes. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Marianne later uses this epiphany to persuade Sean to allow Simon's organs to be donated. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. In The Heart, Thomas is assigned the arduous task of convincing Marianne and Sean to authorize the donation of their son's organs. She is scolded by Dr. Révol for speaking to Simon as if he were a live patient in front of his parents who, according to Dr. Révol, may misinterpret her words as a sign that their son can still be saved when in reality, he cannot. Dr. Emmanuel Harfang is the head cardiac surgeon at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital who accepts Simon's heart from Dr. Carrare and performs Claire's transplantation.

Plot\nKate Fitzgerald has acute promyelocytic leukemia. As neither her parents, firefighter Brian and lawyer Sara, nor older brother Jesse are a genetic match, Dr. Anna's life is one of hospitalizations, growth hormone injections, opioid painkillers, sleeping pills, bleeding, and infections. While Sara has no qualms over using Anna's body to treat Kate's, Brian is closer to Anna and has misgivings over their treatment of her. Anna sues her parents for medical emancipation and the rights to her own body. Campbell's covert epilepsy lends him sympathy to her predicament. Flashbacks detail Kate and Anna's close relationship and how Kate's illness has affected Jesse, who has run away from his summer camp. Kate requests to go to the beach one last time. Brian obtains permission and discharges her from the hospital for the day. Sara is forced to acknowledge what Kate has been trying to tell her: she is ready to die. Anna reveals that every year on Kate's birthday, they go to Montana, which was her \"most favorite place in the world.\" She concludes that she was not born merely to save her sister, she was born because she had a sister, and that their relationship continues even in death. Cast\n\nProduction\nUpon the original creation of the film adaptation, sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning were cast to play Kate and Anna respectively. However, when Dakota heard that she would be required to shave her head for the role, she dropped out of the film as then did Elle. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of reviews for the film were positive, based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 5.54/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"My Sister's Keeper gets fine performances from its adult and child actors, but the director's heavy-handed approach turns a worthy emotional subject into an overly melodramatic tearjerker.\" Box office\nIn its opening weekend it placed 5th with a total of $12,442,212, behind Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Proposal (second weekend), The Hangover (fourth weekend), and Up (fifth weekend).

Patient Zero is a 2018 science fiction horror film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky and written by Mike Le. The plot involves a group of survivors who set out to find an antidote for a highly contagious virus that turns the infected into a ravenous but highly intelligent new species. Ruzowitzky signed on to direct in May 2014. Principal photography began on 3 March 2015 in London, before ending on 18 April. Rossellini directed the film in French and had to depend on Max Colpet to translate for him throughout shooting. While filming on location in the streets of Berlin, Rossellini was amazed by the indifference to a film crew from people on the streets who were far too preoccupied with attempting to get food and survive.\n\nQuestion: Are both director of film Germany, Year Zero and director of film Cross Shot from the same country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Princess Pingyi was said to be both beautiful and virtuous. Emperor Xiaojing personally visited Gao Cheng and her to congratulate them. Her husband was Emperor Fei (Chen Bozong). In 566, she gave birth to the only son of his known to history, Chen Zhize (陳至澤). In 555, with Emperor Wenxuan growing increasingly unstable in his mental state, he forced her to move out of Jingde Palace. Further, alleging that Gao Cheng had previously forced his wife Empress Li Zu'e to have sexual relations with Gao Cheng, Emperor Wenxuan forced her to have sexual relations with him.

It had been claimed that she was born into a banner family named Gu and took on Manchu identity after her marriage to Yihui 奕会 (1799-1838), a Manchu prince. Other scholars claim that the confusion about her identity is an attempt to obscure her family's descent from E-er-tai, a Manchu grand secretary disgraced (and forced to commit suicide) during one of Qianlong's literary inquisitions.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \"a sentimental urban fairy tale\" that \"succeeds neither as an all-out inspirational drama nor as a send-up of American manners.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \"There is possibly a good movie to be found somewhere within this story, but Mike Nichols has not found it in Regarding Henry. This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.\" Ebert also described the way it makes a connection between Ritz Crackers and the Ritz-Carlton hotel (which reveals that Henry's affair had in fact been deeply embedded in his apparently lost memories) as \"especially annoying\", apparently regarding it as comic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" Variety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\" The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" Box office\nThe film opened in 800 theaters in the United States on July 12, 1991, and grossed $6,146,782 on its opening weekend, ranking seventh at the US box office.

Sarah enrolls Rachel into an out-of-town elite school, though she is now reluctant to go. At orientation, Henry tells Rachel a lie to help her adjust to the new school. While at a dinner party, they overhear several \"friends\" making derogatory comments about him.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \"a sentimental urban fairy tale\" that \"succeeds neither as an all-out inspirational drama nor as a send-up of American manners.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \"There is possibly a good movie to be found somewhere within this story, but Mike Nichols has not found it in Regarding Henry. This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.\" Ebert also described the way it makes a connection between Ritz Crackers and the Ritz-Carlton hotel (which reveals that Henry's affair had in fact been deeply embedded in his apparently lost memories) as \"especially annoying\", apparently regarding it as comic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" Variety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\" The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" Box office\nThe film opened in 800 theaters in the United States on July 12, 1991, and grossed $6,146,782 on its opening weekend, ranking seventh at the US box office.

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. Three years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Filming Principal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Music James Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Release The first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. In the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\".

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\".

None of these patients exhibited any clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of surgical abdomen. Moreover, it was difficult to determine a definite diagnosis and a treatment plan due to limitations in history taking and radiologic examination. After admission to the hospital, these patients underwent surgery for the following reasons: (1) failure to spontaneously pass ingested foreign materials; (2) sudden-onset abdominal pain and vomiting during hospitalization; and (3) gastric perforation incidentally discovered during gastroduodenoscopy. Subsequently, all patients were discharged without complications; however, their conditions might have been fatal without surgery at an appropriate time. Ingestion of a foreign body (FB) occurs commonly in children aged between 6 months and 6 years . In the Unites States, a total of 94,820 cases were reported in 2015, and 68,371 of these cases occurred in pediatric patients aged ≤5 years . Although conservative treatment is sufficient in most cases of FB ingestion , ingested FBs can cause serious morbidity or mortality depending on their size, their shape, and the patient’s medical status; therefore, endoscopic or surgical intervention is occasionally required. A 5-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency medical center of our hospital with the complaint of magnetic FB ingestion. Since the patient’s vital signs were stable and there were no signs of peritonitis, we opted not to perform surgical or endoscopic intervention. Instead, the patient was closely monitored for the spontaneous passage of FBs and any clinical deterioration. During her hospitalization, we observed well-tolerated oral feeding with adequate defecation and good physical activity. However, serial abdominal radiographs obtained through the sixth hospital day indicated that the patient’s FBs had not passed through the digestive tract. A 28-month-old boy was admitted to our emergency medical center based on a complaint of irritability. At admission, his vital signs were stable, and there were no indications of abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness suggestive of peritonitis. Because the boy was stable and no signs of surgical abdomen were observed, we planned to perform conservative treatment with close monitoring until the FB was spontaneously passed. However, on the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient exhibited abdominal distention and projectile vomiting with markedly reduced physical activity. The attachment of these two FBs caused an ileocecal fistula and eventually led to internal herniation of the small intestine. A 14-month-old boy was admitted to our emergency medical center with the complaint of vomiting and irritability. Since the patient’s clinical condition became stable after fluid infusion with short-term bowel rest and he exhibited good physical activity with no abdominal pain, we discharged him from the emergency medical center after educating his parents to carefully look for spontaneous passage of the FB. However, the patient revisited our hospital for persistent postprandial vomiting 2 days after his discharge. Because no signs of surgical abdomen were observed, we decided to perform a diagnostic endoscopy to investigate whether the FB had caused gastric obstruction. Therefore, the boy was immediately transferred to the operating room, and emergent surgery was performed. The adherence of these three FBs caused a gastrojejunal fistula with adhesion and perforation of the ileum (Fig. In pediatric patients, ingested FBs are typically small objects such as coins, fish bones, marbles, and drugs; a recent meta-analysis indicated that batteries and sharp objects should be removed immediately but that other ingested FBs can be passed spontaneously . In particular, the accidental ingestion of magnetic FBs in pediatric patients has become common due to the increasing use of toys with magnetic elements . A single magnetic FB does not cause serious morbidity because it simply behaves as an isolated FB; in contrast, multiple magnetic FBs can attract each other across intestinal walls, leading to intestinal obstruction, fistulas, or perforation. Prior case reports have recommended the endoscopic or surgical removal of ingested magnets by clinicians before FB-associated symptoms develop [6, 7]. However, we found a lack of established consensus regarding treatment strategy in certain situations; in particular, the following questions remain unresolved. (2) How long can we safely wait for the spontaneous passage of ingested FBs in patients who have ingested one or more magnets? As presented in our case reports, it appears to be difficult to determine a treatment plan for pediatric patients with FB ingestion because children and babies often cannot explain where they have pain or how their pain feels. Moreover, they cannot describe the number, size, or nature of ingested\n\n and soon retired to his hotel in hopes of regaining enough energy to finish the songs he had been rehearsing.

Her passion for Goethe revived, and in 1835, after lengthy discussions with the writer and landscape gardener Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, she published her book Goethe's Correspondence with a Child (Goethes Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde), which purported to be a correspondence between herself and the poet. The book is in large part fictitious. Genuine sonnets of Goethe in it were addressed, not to her, but to Minna Herzlieb. As a work of fiction, the book has been praised. She continued to write, inspire, and publish until 20 January 1859, when she died in Berlin, aged 73, surrounded by her children. Her grave is in the Wiepersdorf churchyard.

The two friends acknowledged only natural impulses, laws, and methods of life, and brooded over the \"tyranny\" of conventionalities. In 1806, Günderrode committed suicide on account of a passion for the philologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. In 1807 at Weimar Bettina made the acquaintance of Goethe, for whom she entertained a significant passion, which the poet did not requite, though he entered into correspondence with her. Their friendship came to an abrupt end in 1811, owing to Bettina's behaviour with Goethe's wife. In 1811, Bettina married Achim von Arnim, the renowned Romantic poet.

Reddy, who directed the first bilingual (Telugu and Tamil) talkie Kalidas (1931). Directed by C. Pullaiah and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theatres and thrust the young industry into mainstream culture. By 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes. That year, under the direction of Krithiventi Nageswara Rao, Prema Vijayam, a film focusing on social issues, was released. Its success prompted the production of dozens of other immensely successful 'social films', notably 1939's Vandemataram, touching on societal problems like the practice of giving dowry, Telugu films increasingly focused on contemporary living: 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 had social themes. Meanwhile, Hamama continued to act in films directed by her first husband. In 1954, while filming a Youssef Chahine film, Struggle in the Valley, Hamama refused to have the Egyptian actor Shukry Sarhan as a co-star, and Chahine offered Omar Sharif the role.

The success of Mad Max has been credited for further opening up the global market to Australian New Wave films. The film became the first in the Mad Max series, giving rise to three sequels: Mad Max 2 (1981), Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and Fury Road (2015).

Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

His individual, exuberant style was built on the Palladian, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. Robert emerged as leader of the first phase of the neo-classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He rejected the Palladian style as \n\n and \"disgustful\". However, he continued its tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, influenced by his four-year stay in Europe. He influenced the development of architecture, not just in Britain, but in Western Europe, North America and in Russia, where his patterns were taken by Scottish architect Charles Cameron. More international in outlook than Adam, he combined Neoclassicism and Palladian conventions and his influence was mediated through his large number of pupils. Adam prescribed strict design codes on the area’s developers so that both modern and traditional architects could build alongside one another without clashing. Adam also laid out rules on how the buildings relate to the streets such as a ban on glass facades.

Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs. Early life Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England, the son of Harold Addison Woodruff and his wife, Margaret Ada Cooper. He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt. The two boys did their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's Pasteur Institute. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at Queen's College in Taunton, Somerset on the south coast of England. Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist Wesley College, where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. After graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal medicine for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. After being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic. While stationed at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical anæsthetics severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used hypnotism as the sole means of anæsthesia for a wide range of dental and surgical procedures. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives. Early career Soon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the FRCS Exam. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. Sheffield After passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, he had planned to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

He and GOSH agreed to proceed with the treatment, to be conducted at GOSH and paid for by the NHS. Hirano was invited to come to the hospital to examine Charlie but did not visit at that time. In January, after Charlie had seizures that caused brain damage, GOSH formed the view that further treatment was futile and might prolong suffering. Charlie's parents still wanted to try the experimental treatment and raised funds for a transfer to a hospital in New York. In February 2017, GOSH asked the High Court to override the parents' decision, questioning the potential of nucleoside therapy to treat Charlie's condition. In July 2017, after receiving a letter signed by several international practitioners defending the potential of the treatment and claiming to provide new evidence, GOSH applied to the High Court for a new hearing. Hirano visited Charlie at GOSH during the second hearing of the case at the request of the judge. After examining scans of Charlie's muscles, Hirano determined it was too late for the treatment to help Charlie and the parents agreed to the withdrawal of life support. GOSH maintained its position throughout that Charlie's condition had deteriorated by January to the extent that the proposed experimental treatment was futile. Treatment Charles Matthew William Gard was born on 4 August 2016, at full term and normal weight, to Christopher Gard, a postman, and Constance Yates, a carer for young people with learning difficulties, both of Bedfont, west London. He was fed a high-calorie formula through a nasogastric tube, an ECG was carried out, and a cranial MRI scan was performed on 7 October. By November, the doctors suspected that he had mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS), a set of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes essential for mitochondria to function. This diagnosis was confirmed by a genetic test in mid-November, which found that he had two mutated versions of the gene coding for the RRM2B protein. The gene for RRM2B is in the cell nucleus; the protein it codes is necessary for generating nucleosides that are used to make deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in mitochondria. The mitochondria fail in people lacking a functional version of this protein, causing brain damage, muscle weakness (including of the muscles used to breathe) and organ failure, and usually leading to death during infancy. The hospital's ethics committee advised in November 2016 that Charlie should not be given a tracheostomy. Hirano and the GOSH medical team continued to email and discuss the treatment by telephone.

The film, written by George A. Romero and John A. Russo, primarily focuses on a group of people gathering at a farmhouse to survive from an onslaught of zombies in rural Pennsylvania. It is known to have inspired the modern interpretation of zombies as reanimated human corpses that feast on the flesh and/or brains of the living. Due to a copyright error during its release, Night of the Living Deads status in the public domain has resulted in numerous works claiming to expand upon or spin off from the plot points and characters of the film, sometimes without the involvement of the original cast and crew members. They consist of various films, literature, and other forms of media that explore the outbreak and evolution of a zombie apocalypse and society's reaction to it. The two most notable are Romero's Dead series, consisting of five additional films, and the Return of the Living Dead series, which was loosely based on Russo's novel of the same name. Romero tried to make each movie unique from the previous, but this led to some of his more serious works, like Day of the Dead, receiving a worse reception compared to his spoof-like film Dawn of the Dead. Produced and directed by Romero on a budget of $114,000, it grossed $30 million internationally.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Dawn Of Life?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Charlie was born on August 4, 2016, seemingly healthy. But two months into his short life his parents noticed his health was declining. He was diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and loss of motor skills. Charlie was the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with the disease, according to his parents. As the disease progressed, Charlie became weaker, losing the ability to move his arms or legs or breathe, and he experienced seizures. He was then placed on a ventilator that was breathing for him. Through their own research, Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States doing research on an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy who was willing to treat Charlie. The doctor, Michio Hirano of New York’s Columbia University Medical Center, specializes in myopathies and other neuromuscular diseases. The treatment used as part of Hirano’s research has only been used on a couple of patients with a less severe form of the disorder. At the end of January, Charlie’s parents launched a GoFundMe page to raise money to bring Charlie to the United States for that treatment. In three months, they exceeded their 1.3 million ($1.65 million) goal to cover the costs, but the hospital stepped in and opposed this effort, stating that it was not in the best interest of their patient. In February, the hospital decided, based on Charlie’s status, that treatment was unlikely to benefit Charlie. Unable to agree, the hospital went to court to have a judge decide, hoping to be able to remove Charlie from life support. In April, the UK High Court ruled that it was in the infant’s best interest for his treating clinicians to remove the ventilator keeping him alive. This was upheld by a British Supreme Court decision that the hospital could discontinue life support to Charlie and he could not be transferred to the US or elsewhere. Charlie’s story and his parents’ fight caught the attention of world leaders near and far, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who supported the hospital. “I am deeply saddened by the death of Charlie Gard. My thoughts and prayers are with Charlie’s parents Chris and Connie at this difficult time,” May said in a statement released on Friday. The case resurfaced a decades-old debate over euthanasia and the use of life support, issues that have been fought in most corners of the world and that have often seen medical and religious arguments collide. On Monday, Charlie’s parents gave up their fight to take Charlie to the US after new brain and muscle scans revealed their son had deteriorated and was therefore less likely to benefit from the experimental treatment, while his doctors and parents battled in court. The hospital and parents found themselves in court once again this week.This time, Charlie’s parents argued for the right to bring Charlie home from the hospital to die rather than the hospital or hospice.The hospital argued there were too many obstacles including the unwillingness of any care provider to accompany Charlie. The disagreement focused on whether Charlie’s ventilation tubes should be withdrawn in the hospital, in the hospice, at home soon after transfer or at home after a period of days. Sleep tight our beautiful little boy,” Charlie’s parents said in a statement after they gave up their fight. On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and guitarist of the American rock band Nirvana, was found dead at his home in Seattle, Washington. It was determined he had died three days earlier, on April 5. The Seattle Police Department incident report stated that Cobain was found with a shotgun across his body, had suffered a visible gunshot wound to the head, and that a suicide note had been discovered nearby. Conspiracy theories that Cobain was murdered have spread. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. He was also prone to alcoholism, suffered from depression, and regularly used drugs and inhalants. Cobain had two uncles who killed themselves using guns. On March 3, 1994, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome following an overdose of painkillers. His management agency, Gold Mountain Records, said that the overdose was accidental, and that he was suffering from influenza and fatigue. However, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, later said the overdose had been a suicide attempt: \"He took 50 pills. Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, said that the family had a history of suicide, and that Cobain had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder. Cobain said that his stomach pain had been so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal, and that taking heroin was \"the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now\". He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody.\" He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do.\" Death On March 31, 1994, Cobain left the rehabilitation center he had checked into the day before, Exodus Recovery Center, by scaling a six-foot wall. Cobain told the taxi driver he wanted to buy shells because he had been burglarized. Smith thought Cobain was asleep until he saw blood oozing from his ear. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. Cobain did not want the gun purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it for his own protection. The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbows. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. On April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was evidence of Valium in his blood. The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remained suicide and that the images would not be released to the public; however the images were released in 2016. Memorial and cremation On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived, and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house. Reactions from Cobain's friends Several of Cobain's friends were surprised by his suicide. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\" In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\". Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. The song \"Tearjerker\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the\n\nA Pox Upon You. Chickenpox is a viral infection common among children, particularly those under age 12. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Usually the child recovers without complications. It used to be one of the classic childhood diseases.

Once a child has had chickenpox, as have most of the adults of my age who lived before the time of the chickenpox vaccine, the virus usually remains dormant, or asleep, in the body for a lifetime. About 1 in 10 adults will experience the virus emerge, for some unknown reason but usually during a period of stress, as shingles. For some unfortunate individuals the pain continues past the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. Bitterness is like chickenpox. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. I love it when brilliant physicians are not afraid to tell the truth that vaccines are harming our babies so much. But having MDs have concerns about the same things as they have is worth so much to parents. It lets them know that they are on the right tract. So thank you so much for giving parents the strength to follow their convictions. Or not cry when they inject your newborn with hepatitis vaccine before you can say anything. I do not know how pediatrician’s can get up every day and do what they do.,they see the results yet say nothing for fear of being sued.its a no win situation for them. Pediatrician’s have chosen the safe road. Maybe governments and pediatrician’s look at side effects as a small insignificant percentage compared to the total but when it hits your child it 100%. She was wonderfully and beautifully made, so very perfectly healthy.She surpassed all the milestones and was a happy and healthy little girl. And only a few hours later, Charlotte had passed away from what the doctor is calling SIDS. This is not coincidence. She was perfectly healthy, that’s what the doctor said! Those of us who have not suffered a loss as devastating as yours have no adequate understanding nor words sufficient to send our sadness and grief, just a moment to stand beside you and send our prayers for comfort, and eventual peace. Until then, keep up surviving, and may you once again find some thriving ability. Though there is not enough money in the world that would make the loss of a child ok, it can at least bring a measure of comfort knowing that you did something about it. I’m no lawyer but it seems that you have a strong case that vaccines caused the death of your child. My perfectly healthy son died in 1999, and I’ve always believed it to be related to his 2-month vaccination. He was in the 99th percentile in his growth milestones and all was good. He completely changed in behavior and became lethargic and would barely eat. He was also hot all the time and would cry a lot. I called his Dr. several times between the shots and when he passed just before his 4-month drs appointment. I was always told that if the fever went away when he drank some water, he would be fine. He was not fine since the day he got those shots and I have not healed from his death almost 20 years ago. Do you realise how bad vaccinse are for you??? Our son died the night after his vaccines. Thank you for your courage in posting such a private tragedy and loss. I’m so sorry for the loss of your babies. I, too, have experienced the loss of a baby due to vaccines, but called the non-answer “SIDS” by the medical examiner. 25 years ago, my son, Valequin Vonne was a healthy, happy, amazing baby who died within 32 hours of the 6 months shots he received. He was extremely fussy but, as a medical assistant who was responsible for giving shots to many babies, I believed what I was told; it was a “normal” reaction and gave him tylenol. This has been going on for far too long. I am so so sorry for the loss of your healthy and happy baby, and thank you for you courage, as a medical assistant, to tell the truth now, for others to wake up finally, out of their sleeping trust in these corporations who, really\n\nOn April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and guitarist of the American rock band Nirvana, was found dead at his home in Seattle, Washington. It was determined he had died three days earlier, on April 5. The Seattle Police Department incident report stated that Cobain was found with a shotgun across his body, had suffered a visible gunshot wound to the head, and that a suicide note had been discovered nearby. Conspiracy theories that Cobain was murdered have spread. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. He was also prone to alcoholism, suffered from depression, and regularly used drugs and inhalants. Cobain had two uncles who killed themselves using guns. On March 3, 1994, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome following an overdose of painkillers. His management agency, Gold Mountain Records, said that the overdose was accidental, and that he was suffering from influenza and fatigue. However, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, later said the overdose had been a suicide attempt: \"He took 50 pills. Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, said that the family had a history of suicide, and that Cobain had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder. Cobain said that his stomach pain had been so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal, and that taking heroin was \"the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now\". He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody.\" He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do.\" Death On March 31, 1994, Cobain left the rehabilitation center he had checked into the day before, Exodus Recovery Center, by scaling a six-foot wall. Cobain told the taxi driver he wanted to buy shells because he had been burglarized. Smith thought Cobain was asleep until he saw blood oozing from his ear. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. Cobain did not want the gun purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it for his own protection. The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbows. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. On April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was evidence of Valium in his blood. The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remained suicide and that the images would not be released to the public; however the images were released in 2016. Memorial and cremation On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived, and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house. Reactions from Cobain's friends Several of Cobain's friends were surprised by his suicide. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\" In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\". Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. The song \"Tearjerker\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.

It was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. She was the first wife of film director Ezz El-Dine Zulficar. Later revered as an icon in Egyptian cinema. Hamama substantially helped in improving the cinema industry in Egypt and emphasizing the importance of women in cinema and Egyptian society. The film addresses the decadence of Egyptian society during the Gamal Abdel Nasser era. It tells the story of a simple Egyptian civil servant, Anis (played by Emad Hamdi), who cannot tolerate the hypocrisy of the Egyptian government (for whom he works at the Ministry of Health) and the illiteracy of the Egyptian public and decides to hide from all the problems in the country by taking up smoking hashish in a shisha, a popular smoking habit in Egypt, to escape from reality. Anis (who used to work as a teacher) meets with an old student, Ragab (actor Ahmed Ramzy), by chance. He soon discovers that everyone is smoking to forget the reality and hypocrisy of Egyptian life.

In the 1970s, the most popular song of the decade was Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life,” which spend 10 weeks at the top of Billboard’s singles chart in 1977. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The songs on the album reflect the maturity of someone who has already gone through the highs and lows of love and is now experiencing what the emotion is like at this stage of her life. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Included on the album is the now classic “Angels of Fenway,” a tribute to the Boston Red Sox World Series championship season in 2004.

In 1445, as a belated consequence of the death of his father, he decided to renounce Prades and Vilamur in favor of his own son, Joan Ramon III.

Although Unrest was written by an ME sufferer, the aim of the documentary is to highlight the experiences of so many people suffering from different chronic, “hidden” diseases that remain poorly understood, both by the medical community and wider society. Jennifer Brea was working on her PhD at Harvard and about to marry when she suffered a series of sudden viral infections that left her incapacitated. It premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival where it received the Special Jury Award for editing. They include 23-year old Jessica Taylor from Kent who has been bedridden since she was 15; Karina Hansen who was forcibly institutionalised and denied contact with her parents because doctors in Denmark consider ME to be psychosomatic; and Ron Davis, a Stanford Professor of Genetics who embarks on a mission to find a cure for his son. Although primarily about ME, Unrest shines a light on what it is like to live with a chronic, misunderstood illness and as viewers will see, the symptoms are almost identical to Lyme disease. LDUK spokesperson and talented musician, Ren Gill, is featured in Unrest and his music is also used in the film.

The film is based on the life of Evan Perry, who experienced bipolar depression from a young age. The documentary was filmed throughout Evan's life, because whenever his parents, Dana and Hart Perry, consulted a psychiatrist about Evan's suicidal comments or other signs of mental illness, the psychiatrists did not believe that their son was depressed. The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed. Evan Perry had a family medical history involving serious mental illnesses. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him. About four years after Evan's death, the documentary was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and released on television and DVD. It shocked her because at that age, she thought kids would not even know what death is, and he did not seem sad when he was talking about dying. Dana Perry, a professional filmmaker, knew that psychiatrists would not believe everything she told them about her son. At this point, she decided to film as much as she could from Evan's life, especially when he talked about suicide. Evan was very much into filming, just like his parents. His responses were really short towards his family, he was listening to Nirvana, he was writing songs about suicide, demons, and pain, and he would lock himself in his room away from everyone. Middle childhood When Evan was 10 years old he started attending Pk Yonge School and made his first attempt to commit suicide. When his parents picked him up, they went straight to the Four Winds which is a mental institution. There they diagnosed him with Bipolar depression. His whole stay there, Evan kept saying that he simply did it for attention, however they knew it was just his way of getting the attention off of him. When Evan was stable enough to leave the institution, his parents sent him to Wellspring which is a home for troubled kids like Evan. At Wellspring he ran away his first night, but eventually he gave in and let himself get help. His family also went to Wellspring for family therapy, so that they could all learn to communicate and understand Evan. Adolescence At this school Evan became very involved, he made many friends and he would go out and have fun. Evan had jumped out his window and left a numbered list of reasons to live and die for, then deciding that dying was his solution. Family Hart Perry (father) Evan's father had a brother who was diagnosed with bipolar depression and committed suicide at the age of 21. Because of this, he did everything he could to prevent the same outcome for his son, Evan Perry. Hart did everything he could to make Evan happy, he would film with him, he would go to therapy with Evan, and he was very supportive. She recorded it and put it in the documentary and it shows Evan climbing onto his bed and showing his mom how he was going to hang himself from the roof of his room. Dana Perry was very caring towards her son and tried everything she could to stop his story from ending so soon. Throughout the documentary, Nicholas explained how most of the songs Evan wrote were very relatable for someone Nick's age. Nicholas was more than 5 years older than Evan, so while Evan was 7 years old, writing songs about his inner pain and demons in his head, Nicholas was in high school and experiencing this. When the suicide note was discovered and Nicholas read it, he realized that everything Evan was experiencing was common. Nicholas along with every teenager feels this at one point or another, Evan just felt it to a different intensity. Production The film was made by the boy's parents, director Dana Perry and cinematographer Hart Perry. Critical response Variety noted that because of his parents' occupations, they did a good job in recording his life, and produced an \"elegiac little gem\". The Philadelphia Inquirer called it a \"remarkable, deeply unsettling documentary\", scoring it 3/4 stars. It was begun in Greece and finished in a motel in Hollywood around 1969 along with everything else. He also said that he's putting the first couple of lines on his tombstone, and I'll be hurt if he doesn't.\" In the 1960s, Cohen lived on the Greek island Hydra with his girlfriend Marianne. She has related how she helped him out of a depression by \n\n kind of oppositional in nature to the dominant mainstream culture... that's very inspiring to me...\" Cohen's longer works include his feature film, Museum Hours, Chain, and the experimental documentary, Instrument, a portrait of the D.C. punk band Fugazi that was ten years in the making. Other works of note are Lost Book Found, his Walter Benjamin-inspired portrait of New York City, Buried in Light, a series of connected Central and Eastern European city portraits, and his short film about the late Elliott Smith, Lucky Three.

She was a pioneering researcher in women's health, studying the use of radiation therapy rather than surgery for uterine tumors and developing a vaginoscope that revolutionized women's health care in Brazil. Born into a wealthy family, whose forebears had been involved in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices that prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. Early life and education María Teresa Ferrari Alvarado was born on 11 October 1887 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Catalina Alvarado and David Ferrari White. For a woman of Ferrari's social class, paid work was unusual at the time. She had studied psychology in a cutting-edge field known as \"experimental psychology\" and applied it to her classes, which caused the authorities to launch an investigation into her teaching methods. She was allowed to continue teaching, as her techniques of motivating students and encouraging them to learn proved effective. In her first year, she was assigned to work as an assistant to in his pathology research, which inspired her continued participation in medical research. In 1918 the couple had their only child, Maurio Nicholás Gaudino. In the proceedings of the Honorable Consejo Directivo (HCD) on 23 June 1915, it was stated: \"Despite their qualifications, for physiological and psychological reasons people of the feminine sex do not meet the required conditions to be engaged as professors in the Faculty [of Medicine]\". Newspapers in Argentina, including La Prensa, La Nación, La Razón, and others of the capital, El Censor in Gualeguaychú, Los Andes in Mendoza, Buenos Aires Sud in Florencio Varela, and the Italian La Patria degli Italiani and Spanish El Diario Español carried stories of her triumph. In the interim, rather than await a decision, Ferrari continued her studies. She was an assisting physician in the clinic of Marie Curie in Paris, as well as, in the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, D.C. When her professorship was finally approved and she returned to Argentina, a celebration was held on 11 August 1927 at the Jockey Club of Buenos Aires, attended by the Minister of the Interior, ; the director of the Hospital Militar, Alberto Levenne; her research mentor, Joaquín Llambías; and many colleagues, peers, family members, and friends.

Scott was charged with first- and second-degree child abuse, first- and second-degree assault, and reckless endangerment. Frederick County Assistant State's Attorney Lindell K. Angel had urged Circuit Court Judge G. Edward Dwyer to set Scott's bail at $250,000, calling her a danger to herself and others.

How did it come about? The official name is Neonatal Comfort Care Program and it’s a service of perinatal and neonatal palliative care, so our team takes care of babies before and after birth. In the latter case, a baby may not live longer than a few minutes or a few hours after birth, however some of these newborns go on to live for days or weeks and there is really no standard of care for them. Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. And I should be able to address desires and expectations of their families.” My first case was a little girl with Trisomy 18 who lived for two weeks. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. That was the beginning. After her, I started following other mothers and other babies and the number of families I have been following has been greatly increasing over time. Other professionals were fascinated by this new way to treat babies with short lives and I started being helped by a number of them, but the patients grew so much that I realized that I needed to hire some more professionals. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Therefore, our program is running because of the generosity of donors. Just to give you an idea, in 2008 I followed thirteen families, while in 2017, more than 100. These families are confronted with very bad news. But suddenly you learn from the obstetricians that your baby has something really bad that will make his or her life short. There is a lot of emotional and psychological support needed, and this is more about what my team does. But even after they’re born, they will be held, they will be fed, they will be warm, and they won’t experience any pain. In short, we do follow the babies along their natural life. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. What does it matter if you live eight minutes or eight years? The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. From the point of view of the nurses, in the very beginning there was a lot of concern and lack of desire to be part of this project because it is such an unusual scenario. Traditionally when babies with a life-limiting condition are born, they are admitted to the NICU for comfort care. However, I am not sure about the “comfort” they receive because they are very often kept in an incubator until they die. Ideally these babies should be with mom and family in post-partum, however, the nurses\n\n Overill Dwyer-Brown (born 4 January 1961) is a Jamaican hurdler.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.
