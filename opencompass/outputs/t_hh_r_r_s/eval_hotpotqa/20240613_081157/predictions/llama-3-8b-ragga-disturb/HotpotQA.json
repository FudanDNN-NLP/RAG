The structure was erected in 1896 as St. Luke's Hospital, and was designed by Ernest Flagg. Several additions were built in the early 20th century, and some of the original pavilions have been demolished. Parts of the facility have been designated as an official New York City landmark, and the remaining pavilions of the original hospital are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The next year, the institution had acquired a plot on Fifth Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets, near St. Patrick's Cathedral. John W. Ritch designed a new brick building in the Romanesque Revival style, which was composed of two wings flanking a central pavilion. St. Luke's Hospital moved to its Fifth Avenue location in 1858. The surrounding area developed quickly, and by the late 19th century, the hospital's Fifth Avenue location was becoming increasingly outdated due to the expansion of the hospital facilities, as well as the increasing value of the land in Midtown. The arrangement was expected to be mutually beneficial for both institutions. An annual report from St. Luke's lauded the proximity to Morningside Park, immediately to the east, as well as its elevated location on top of the Morningside Heights plateau. The building committee headed a design competition for the project, in which eighty firms participated. Five prominent architects Heins & LaFarge, James Brown Lord, George Edward Harney, James Renwick Jr., and Charles W. Clinton, were offered $400 to submit designs. Renwick and Clinton declined to enter the competition, and other architects submitted plans without receiving compensation. The competition was mildly controversial: the Real Estate Record and Guide said that because competitors could not use pseudonyms, the judges could more easily identify the architects that they favored. Flagg likely benefited from favoritism: he had been described as a \"surrogate son\" of Cornelius Vanderbilt II, who was part of St. Luke's executive and building committees, and had no previous design experience. Though the building committee initially had reservations about the selection, it appointed Flagg and Charles Clinton jointly as architects for the project, with the stipulation that the committee could revise the plan at any time. St. Luke's began work on the project in May 1893 and sold their Fifth Avenue building the next month. The project was beset by delays and disputes due to Flagg's combativeness toward suppliers: he objected to the quality of such materials as the marble, steel, and stained glass. The hospital's trustees expressed concerns, because they had promised to leave the old building by July 1894. Despite this, the trustees chose to remain within part of its Fifth Avenue campus and turn the rest over to the new owners, the Union Club of the City of New York. The total cost of construction was $1.7 million. Affluent patients at first avoided St. Luke's due to the lack of a private pavilion, hurting its business. The money for an expansion was finally provided in a donation from Margaret J. Plant, wife of the late railroad magnate Henry B. After Flagg submitted plans in early 1904, work started on the Plant Pavilion in April 1904, and after a delay caused by a labor strike, it was completed in 1906. The first was Travers Pavilion on 114th Street, which was built between 1908 and 1911. A decade later, Flagg was hired to design another pavilion for private patients,\n\n 220 West 57th Street is on the southern side of 57th Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue two blocks south of Central Park, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City.

Scott Fitzgerald House, also known as Summit Terrace, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, is part of a rowhouse designed by William H. Willcox and Clarence H. Johnston Sr. The house, at 599 Summit Avenue, is listed as a National Historic Landmark for its association with author F. Scott Fitzgerald. The design of the rowhouse was called the \"New York Style\", where each unit was given a distinctive character similar to rowhouses in eastern cities.

Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Etymology\nThe genera name is derived from the Greek words harpago meaning hook and phyton meaning plant. H. procumbens is one of the floral emblems of Botswana where it is thought to be useful in treating a variety of pain conditions. Ecology and management \nHarpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

Ecology and management \nHarpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The ecological requirements of a harvested species must be known to manage the harvest of the species to ensure it is sustainable. Stewart and Cole (2005) examined the complex economic, social, and cultural factors involved in the harvest of the species. Harvest also did not affect growth, although plants in the medium size class grew more during the study period in both the harvested and unharvested populations. Fruit production was highly variable, and mature fruits were produced only under favorable conditions. Under the conditions of this experimental harvest, the species appears to be resilient to harvest, with plants subjected to harvest surviving as well as unharvested plants. However, due to the spatially variable nature of its habitat and the plasticity of the plants themselves, harvesting data from actual harvested areas from a large number of plants is required to better understand the life history of the species.

Several years after graduation, the trio formed Screaming Trees with singer Mark Lanegan in 1985 (by this time Pickerel no longer performed lead vocals). During this period, Pickerel participated in recording sessions with several bands in the Seattle scene; some of these later appeared on Lanegan's solo album The Winding Sheet and on the Nirvana rarities compilation With the Lights Out. Pickerel played on five studio albums with Screaming Trees, but quit the band in 1991 just before they began recording their breakthrough album Sweet Oblivion. After the band broke up, lead singer Matthew Shelton returned to his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas, where he started a new band called Teleo.

The First Italo-Ethiopian War resulted in the 1896 Battle of Adwa, in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipped and supported by Russia and France. As a result, the Treaty of Addis Ababa was signed in October, which strictly delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the \n\n battlegrounds during the Italian War 1935-36, with initial success by the Ethiopians in the First Battle of Tembien in January 1936, and their dramatic defeat in the Second Battle a month later; after the Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray (followed by attacks of Rayya against atse Haile Selassie's army), the Ethiopian government collapsed. Haile Sellasie's harsh measures to establish control by the central government, however, quickly led to local resistance. In December 1893, Italian colonial troops and Mahdists fought again in the Second Battle of Agordat; Ahmed Ali campaigned against the Italian forces in eastern Sudan and led about 10–12,000 men east from Kassala, encountering 2,400 Italians and their Eritrean Ascaris commanded by Colonel Arimondi. Antonelli also gave Menelik Italy's justifications for a punitive expedition to avenge Dogali. Nevertheless, in early October 1887, Yohannes wrote to Matewos, bishop of Shewa, who was with the Shewan court at Mount Entoto, that he was determined to go to war against Italy.

As a result, the Treaty of Addis Ababa was signed in October, which strictly delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the \n\n battlegrounds during the Italian War 1935-36, with initial success by the Ethiopians in the First Battle of Tembien in January 1936, and their dramatic defeat in the Second Battle a month later; after the Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray (followed by attacks of Rayya against atse Haile Selassie's army), the Ethiopian government collapsed. Haile Sellasie's harsh measures to establish control by the central government, however, quickly led to local resistance. In December 1893, Italian colonial troops and Mahdists fought again in the Second Battle of Agordat; Ahmed Ali campaigned against the Italian forces in eastern Sudan and led about 10–12,000 men east from Kassala, encountering 2,400 Italians and their Eritrean Ascaris commanded by Colonel Arimondi. Antonelli also gave Menelik Italy's justifications for a punitive expedition to avenge Dogali. Nevertheless, in early October 1887, Yohannes wrote to Matewos, bishop of Shewa, who was with the Shewan court at Mount Entoto, that he was determined to go to war against Italy. In the treaty, Italy renounced any intention of annexing Ethiopian territory.\n\n"

Indianapolis hosts the Indianapolis 500 mile race over Memorial Day weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway every May. The name of the race is usually shortened to \"Indy 500\" and also goes by the nickname \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\". The track also hosts the Brickyard 400 (NASCAR) and the Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix. Indiana features the world's largest and most prestigious drag race, the NHRA Mac Tools U.S. Nationals, held each Labor Day weekend at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in Clermont, Indiana. Indiana is also host to a major unlimited hydroplane racing power boat race circuits in the major H1 Unlimited league, the Madison Regatta (Madison, Indiana).

In 1954, Quiroga wrote Algo pasa en la calle, where she explores new and more current areas of the genre of the novel. The novel deals with love failure and a marriage break up that are settled in urban spaces. Its characters are psychologically more complex and close to the mentality of modern men. Elena Quiroga published La Careta (1995) and La Enferma (1955), where she talks about the story of a woman who deals with psychological problems and who is abandoned by his lover. She also wrote Plácida la joven y otras narraciones (1956) and La última corrida (1958). That makes \n\nThe Heart is a 2014 realistic and medical fiction novel by the French author Maylis de Kerangal. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. Plot Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. Révol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. The couple is then introduced to Thomas, who attempts to convince them to authorize the donation of Simon's organs. Eventually, Marianne realizes that allowing Simon to surf and live his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean had done for him, and she decides to accept Thomas' request to donate Simon's organs. Once he gains consent from Marianne and Sean to donate Simon's organs, Thomas contacts the Biomedical Agency, where an evaluation of the organs is performed and recipients are matched to them. Almost immediately, Simon's liver is assigned to a six-year old girl in Strasbourg, his lungs to a seventeen-year old girl in Lyon, and his kidneys to a nine-year old boy in Rouen. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Eventually, he is persuaded by Marianne to allow the hospital to carry out the donations. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. Juliette is Simon's 18-year old girlfriend. Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. Claire Méjan is a 51-year old woman and mother diagnosed with myocarditis who has been waiting for a heart transplant for three years. While Claire is ecstatic about finally receiving a new heart, she is also afraid of the pain and the possibility of death from the operation, and of the loss of her identity. In The Heart, Thomas is assigned the arduous task of convincing Marianne and Sean to authorize the donation of their son's organs. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Dr. Marthe Carrare is one of the founders of the Biomedical Agency, an organization located within the National Center for the Allocation of Transplants that conducts thorough evaluations of transplant organs and allocates them to various hospitals and patients. Virgilio Breva is a cardiac surgery intern at Pitié-Salpêtrière who assists Dr. Harfang in the heart transplantation. Rose is Virgilio's unstable and possessive girlfriend who is resentful of him often being away for operations, and with whom Virgilio cannot bring himself to break up with. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with\n\n"

In 2006, the Doc Film Institute launched Oscar Docs (2006–09, 2011), an annual three-day festival of the Academy Award-nominated short and feature documentaries, featuring introductions and Q&As by many of the nominated filmmakers. In 2011, Daniel Bernardi assumed the directorship of the institute, and film critic and theoretician Bill Nichols became chair of the advisory committee.

At the end of the 2011 season, \n\n Williams was drafted in the fifth round of the 1952 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, where he played from 1952 to 1963 and was part of the Bears' 1963 NFL Championship team. In 1964, he was traded to the Washington Redskins, along with Angelo Coia, for the Redskins' sixth overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft, which they used to select Steve DeLong. When the Redskins played Williams' former team that year, he was involved in a fight with Bears center Mike Pyle after Williams jumped offside and hit Pyle in the head with his forearm. Williams spent two seasons in Washington. Before the draft, he was projected as either a 4–3 three-technique defensive tackle or a 3–4 defensive end at the professional level. McCoy was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 3rd overall pick of the 2010 NFL Draft (as projected, to play 3-technique DT). McCoy and the Buccaneers agreed to a five-year, $63 million contract on July 31, 2010. In 2009 before he quit the team he had impressive numbers including 49 receptions for 746 yards and six touchdowns in only 7 games. At the time of the incident (known as the \"Black 14\"), the Cowboys were undefeated (4–0) and ranked 16th in the AP poll.\n\n"

Perera was restricted by stress fractures in his back for several seasons, but returned to international level in the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup, a triangular tournament featuring India and New Zealand. He was selected to represent India B in the Challenger Trophy in October 2005, a domestic limited-overs tournament. At domestic level, he played for seven different teams in a career spanning from December 1995 to October 2009, though most of his matches came for the Colombo-based Sinhalese Sports Club. Perera made his first-class debut in December 1995, aged 17, playing two matches for the Sinhalese Sports Club in the Saravanamuttu Trophy. During the 1997–98 season, he played nine first-class matches, taking 29 wickets at an average of 19.03, and also debuted for Sri Lanka A.

Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite.

Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or \"brain sand\".

Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO42−, anions. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen. Hydroxyapatite is the main mineral component of enamel in teeth. Use in dentistry As of 2019, the use of hydroxyapatite, or its synthetically manufactured form, nano-hydroxyapatite, is not yet common practice.

Hydroxyapatite has shown significant medium and long-term desensitizing effects on dentine hypersensitivity using evaporative stimuli and the visual analogue scale (alongside potassium nitrate, arginine, glutaraldehyde with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyapatite, adhesive systems, glass ionomer cements and laser). To prevent this, nano-hydroxyapatite can be added to the bleaching solution to reduce the impact of the bleaching agent by blocking pores within the enamel.

It is chemically similar to naturally occurring hydroxyapatite and can mimic the structure and biological function of the structures found in the resident extracellular matrix. As a dental material Hydroxyapatite is widely used within dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, due to its chemical similarity to hard tissue. In recent years, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (nHA) have been used in toothpaste to combat dental hypersensitivity. Synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) is proven to provide successful outcomes in alveolar socket preservation.

Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or \"brain sand\". The hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below: 10 Ca(OH)2 + 6 H3PO4 → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 18 H2O The ability to synthetically replicate hydroxyapatite has invaluable clinical implications, especially in dentistry. Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO42−, anions. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen. Hydroxyapatite is the main mineral component of enamel in teeth. Use in dentistry As of 2019, the use of hydroxyapatite, or its synthetically manufactured form, nano-hydroxyapatite, is not yet common practice. Avian eggshell hydroxyapatite can be a viable filler material in bone regeneration procedures in oral surgery. Hydroxyapatite has shown significant medium and long-term desensitizing effects on dentine hypersensitivity using evaporative stimuli and the visual analogue scale (alongside potassium nitrate, arginine, glutaraldehyde with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyapatite, adhesive systems, glass ionomer cements and laser). To prevent this, nano-hydroxyapatite can be added to the bleaching solution to reduce the impact of the bleaching agent by blocking pores within the enamel. Caries prevention Nano-hydroxyapatite possesses a remineralising effect on teeth and can be used to prevent damage from carious attacks. It is chemically similar to naturally occurring hydroxyapatite and can mimic the structure and biological function of the structures found in the resident extracellular matrix. As a dental material Hydroxyapatite is widely used within dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, due to its chemical similarity to hard tissue. In recent years, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (nHA) have been used in toothpaste to combat dental hypersensitivity. Synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) is proven to provide successful outcomes in alveolar socket preservation. Safety concerns The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) issued an official opinion in 2021, where it considered whether the nanomaterial hydroxyapatite was safe when used in leave-on and rinse-off dermal and oral cosmetic products, taking into account reasonably foreseeable exposure conditions. It involves ionic interactions between positively charged groups on a biomolecule (often a protein) and the phosphate groups in hydroxyapatite, and metal chelation between hydroxyapatite calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate and/or carboxyl groups on the biomolecule. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of trace elements, including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Stable isotope analysis of human and faunal hydroxyapatite can be used to indicate whether a diet was predominantly terrestrial or marine in nature (carbon, strontium); the geographical origin and migratory habits of an animal or human (oxygen, strontium) and to reconstruct past temperatures and climate shifts (oxygen). Hydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH), but it is usually written Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite.

Chamberlain played college baseball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers before the Yankees selected him in the first round of the 2006 MLB draft. He ascended through the minor leagues and made his MLB debut in 2007 as a relief pitcher during the Yankees' pursuit of a berth in the MLB postseason. Hammonds was an outfielder and played for the Baltimore Orioles (1993–1998), Cincinnati Reds (1998–1999), Colorado Rockies (2000), Milwaukee Brewers (2001–2003), San Francisco Giants (2003–2004) and the Washington Nationals (2005) in Major League Baseball (MLB). Before playing professionally, Hammonds played for Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and Stanford University. The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall selection of the 1992 MLB Draft. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was a first round pick (18th overall) in the 1966 June amateur baseball draft, and spent 15 seasons in professional baseball. After being drafted by the San Francisco Giants, he was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 1968 MLB expansion draft.\n\n"

The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.

White Oak Federal Research Center Since 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Scope and funding As of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs Emergency approvals (EUA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Specific standards the FDA exercises differ from one category to\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, the nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. 3/ The Drug Quality and Security Act (P.L. 113-54) authorized three new FDA user fees: the outsourcing facility fees; the prescription drug wholesale distributer licensing and inspection; and, the third-party logistics provider licensing and inspection fees. FDA expects that collections for wholesale distributer and third-party logics provider fees in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 will be minimal. 4/ The FY 2017 President’s Budget proposes to increase the statutory user fee limit for export certification. The FY 2017 Budget includes $5.1 billion in total resources for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an increase of $358 million, or 8 percent above FY 2016. Of this increase, $15 million is in budget authority, $269 million in user fees, and $75 million in new mandatory funding. FDA estimates that Americans pay about two cents per day to ensure that the products FDA regulates, representing more than 20 percent of every consumer dollar spent on products in the United States are safe and effective. The Budget will continue to invest in transforming the food safety system to address today’s challenges, ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical products, supporting the Department’s preparedness enterprise, reducing tobacco use, and conducting innovative research. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. This total includes $1.3 billion in budget authority and $210 million in user fees. In FY 2017, FDA will focus on implementing produce standards for packing, harvesting, and growing fruits and vegetables; and ensuring imported foods meet the same standards of safety as those in the United States. The additional $193 million in new resources are vital to fully support robust implementation of a prevention based food safety system. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. FDA continues to make significant progress in reducing the number of drug shortages, from a high of 251 shortages in 2011 to just 44 new shortages in 2014. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. FDA ensures the safety, quality and effectiveness of a broad scope of medical products used by Americans including biologics such as vaccines, blood products, and gene therapies, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, radiation emitting products, and medical devices ranging from dental devices to surgical implants. This significant accomplishment represents the next step to increasing treatment options for patients. These activities will continue in FY 2017 to improve patient safety by establishing systems that will allow standardized approaches to quickly and efficiently identify drug and device products in the market and streamline the way biologics are reviewed. In addition, in 2015, FDA successfully launched a mobile application to improve public access to information, including current drug shortages, and resolve drug shortages and discontinuations of drug products. In FY 2017, FDA will continue to invest in developing a safer and more modern drug supply system by building on the infrastructure to process biological product applications and support integration of the Unique Facility Identifier into IT systems that support regulatory work. The agency is responsible for overseeing and regulating a wide range of products, including food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and more. The primary objective of the FDA is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. In addition to the FD&C Act, the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This wide-ranging authority allows the FDA to address public health concerns beyond food and drugs. They regulate and control items like medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products. They are dedicated to upholding public health standards and promoting the safety of the American population. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics and products that emit radiation, and by regulating the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is the nation’s medical research agency—making important medical discoveries that improve health and save lives. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly. Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009.

FDA expects that collections for wholesale distributer and third-party logics provider fees in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 will be minimal. 4/ The FY 2017 President’s Budget proposes to increase the statutory user fee limit for export certification. The FY 2017 Budget includes $5.1 billion in total resources for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an increase of $358 million, or 8 percent above FY 2016. Of this increase, $15 million is in budget authority, $269 million in user fees, and $75 million in new mandatory funding. FDA estimates that Americans pay about two cents per day to ensure that the products FDA regulates, representing more than 20 percent of every consumer dollar spent on products in the United States are safe and effective. The Budget will continue to invest in transforming the food safety system to address today’s challenges, ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical products, supporting the Department’s preparedness enterprise, reducing tobacco use, and conducting innovative research. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. This total includes $1.3 billion in budget authority and $210 million in user fees. In FY 2017, FDA will focus on implementing produce standards for packing, harvesting, and growing fruits and vegetables; and ensuring imported foods meet the same standards of safety as those in the United States. The additional $193 million in new resources are vital to fully support robust implementation of a prevention based food safety system. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade.

Many young people have told us that they have received “no understanding” and been treated with disbelief and criticism because there has been no medical diagnosis to give credibility to their experience. Our clinical psychology team works alongside the medical team of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists with children and young people affected by different physical illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer and gastric conditions. In this paper we tell the story of a workshop we facilitated for young people affected by these sorts of symptoms. We will go on to explain how we made use of experience consultants and outsider witness practices and describe the effects of the workshop on the young people who took part. We will highlight how the workshop provided an opportunity for young people designated as ‘patients’ in the hospital to hear and share stories of resilience with other young people invited as the experience consultants because they had worked with us in the past and found ways to get their lives back on track. These labels can direct young people and families towards traditional mental health treatment services where treatment models might assume that a psychic trauma has triggered the symptoms or that the symptoms are ‘functional’. The discourses informing systemic and narrative approaches differ from the traditional medical discourse that uses the language of diagnosis, designates young people as ‘patients’ and assumes that medical tests can objectively distinguish the ‘reality’ of symptoms. Like Michael White we hold that we live our lives according to the stories we tell ourselves and the stories we are told by others . These stories talk to us of who we are, who we were and who we can become. Thus our stories are constitutive, both forming and informing our identities. Michael White described our sense of self as a ‘territory of identity’. He explained how problems like trauma can act to shrink this territory, our sense of who we are, thereby disconnecting us from our abilities to influence our own lives and those of others. We have seen how Pain and Fatigue – especially when teaming up together over many years - can not only shrink but also sometimes even erode the territory of identity of young people. Fatigue often works in tandem with Pain to pin young people to ‘sick’ beds for extensive periods of time thereby isolating them from many of the experiences of their peers such as school, social life and family. Narrative practices involve enabling people to tell stories about their lives in ways that make them stronger [9,10] or enables them to go on. For these stories to live and breathe they also need an audience. Pain and Fatigue often disconnect young people from audiences to the stories they want told about themselves and who might witness and appreciate their preferred versions of self. Even when preferred stories begin to emerge in therapy, they are often witnessed by only a therapist and one or two family members and therefore risk remaining fragile. The Narrative approach offers practices to extend the audience to these stories through the use of certificates, letters and celebrations [11-13]. In outsider witnessing one or several people are invited to join a session. In the first instance the witnesses are asked to listen whilst the interviewer interviews the ‘clients’, creating space for the telling of preferred identity stories. Michael White talks of how the witnesses’ response to the ‘Transport’ question (eg How is your life / work different for what you have heard today?) Hearing the impact that their story has had on others and the contribution their story makes to others’ lives can be a validating experience that opens space for further positive developments of self [2,16]. When we evaluated the group, the young people fed back that they liked meeting others like themselves who were living with similar symptoms or conditions.

In addition, Clarkson offers a traditional BSN degree, an MSN program with five specialties including nurse anesthesia, and a DNP curriculum designed for convenient part-time study. The college typically graduates 100-plus prelicensure BSN students each year, with a notable NCLEX pass rate of 92% over the past eight years. The College of St. Scholastica’s School of Nursing is one of the largest nursing schools in Minnesota. The school graduates 140-180 students annually from its prelicensure BS tracks, and these students have achieved an 84% first-time pass rate on the NCLEX licensure exam over the past decade. St. Scholastica also offers DNP tracks for both APRNs and baccalaureate-prepared RNs. The Department of Nursing at Bethel University produces 70-80 prelicensure BSN graduates each year, who have passed the NCLEX-RN licensure exam at a solid rate of 84% since 2009.

Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. The songs featured on the album are not from his large collection of Top 40 hits, but are instead album tracks that have filled out his unique ability to cleverly tell stories that have made him one of the most important songwriters of the past 50 years. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. Andy Platts and Shawn Lee of Young Gun Silver Fox. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Background Kurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the American grunge rock band Nirvana, one of the most influential acts of the 1990s and one of the best-selling bands of all time. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. In Charles Cross's biography Heavier Than Heaven, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his intervention: \"He was really quiet. Novoselic's offer to buy dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: \"His dealer was right there. On April 8, Cobain's body was discovered in the greenhouse above the garage at his Lake Washington Boulevard East house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith, who arrived that morning to install security lighting. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. Although conductor David Woodard had built a Dreamachine for Cobain, rumors that Cobain had been using the device heavily in the days leading up to his suicide were contradicted by later reports. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. On April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". Memorial and cremation On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures. A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse\". Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain, told Rolling Stone: \"I never knew Cobain to be suicidal. In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\". Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" Kurt's death was unexpected ... It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. The song \"Tearjerker\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain. A musical hero of Cobain's, Greg Sage, said in an interview: Well, I can't really speculate other than what he said to me, which was, he wasn't at all happy about it, success to him seemed like, I think, a brick wall. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.

        "context": "The songwriter who could easily be considered America’s unofficial poet laureate has a new album in which he revisits past composition with new recordings and new interpretations. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. The songs featured on the album are not from his large collection of Top 40 hits, but are instead album tracks that have filled out his unique ability to cleverly tell stories that have made him one of the most important songwriters of the past 50 years. While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. Coolidge gives voice to the realization that relationships and romance don’t end after you reach a certain age, but that they are filtered through years of experiences. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. Andy Platts and Shawn Lee of Young Gun Silver Fox. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Background Kurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the American grunge rock band Nirvana, one of the most influential acts of the 1990s and one of the best-selling bands of all time. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. In Charles Cross's biography Heavier Than Heaven, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his intervention: \"He was really quiet. Novoselic's offer to buy dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: \"His dealer was right there. On April 8, Cobain's body was discovered in the greenhouse above the garage at his Lake Washington Boulevard East house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith, who arrived that morning to install security lighting. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. Although conductor David Woodard had built a Dreamachine for Cobain, rumors that Cobain had been using the device heavily in the days leading up to his suicide were contradicted by later reports. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. On April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". Memorial and cremation On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures. A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse\". Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain, told Rolling Stone: \"I never knew Cobain to be suicidal.

Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\". Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" Kurt's death was unexpected ... It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way.

He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Early life and education Medawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father's profession as selling \"false teeth in South America\".) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, \"My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'.\" Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \"towards the end of the war\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire.

An only child, when he was four years old, his family moved to Dearborn, Michigan. However, according to his Columbia Studios press kit biography, his studies were interrupted when he was knocked down a flight of stairs during a \"student rush\", which resulted in a three-month hospital stay.

The act received favorable reviews in Time magazine and The New York Times and ultimately led directly to the pair being cast on The Wild Wild West television series, a Western spy spoof with elements of historical fiction and science fiction, which debuted in 1965. Dunn was probably best known for his recurring role on that series as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a mad scientist who devised passionately perverse schemes and gadgetry to ensnare Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin). Dorin played Dr. Loveless's devoted assistant, Antoinette. According to Dorin, Dunn saved her from drowning during filming of the episode \"The Night of the Murderous Spring\", plunging underwater to tear her free, when her costume became entangled in machinery used to sink a boat on the set. Dunn appeared as Dr Loveless 10 times on The Wild Wild West (four times apiece in the first two seasons and one time apiece in the remaining two seasons). In the pilot episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry television spy spoof Get Smart, Dunn showed his skill with comic farce as the well-heeled gangster Mr. Big, leader of international crime organization K.A.O.S. (September 18, 1965). Dunn featured as Alexander, a courageous court jester, in the Star Trek episode \"Plato's Stepchildren\" (November 22, 1968). He also appeared in an episode of Bonanza, \"It's a Small World\" (January 4, 1970), portraying a recently widowed circus performer trying to start a new life, and as a killer clown in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \"The Wax Men\" (5 March 1967).

The third season of the animated television series The Legend of Korra, titled Book Three: Change, was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and consists of thirteen episodes (\"chapters\"), all animated by Studio Mir. The season takes place largely in the Earth Kingdom, one of the four major nations in the setting of the series, while depicting the re-emergence of airbending among people of other nations. The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar. ; Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Iroh: A retired Fire Nation general and the wise and nurturing uncle and mentor to Zuko.\n\n"

Benjamin tenOever completed his postdoctoral formation in Molecular Biology from Harvard University in 2007 after receiving his PhD in Medicine from McGill University in 2004. This training was subsequently applied to the study of host and pathogen interactions, with a focus on the molecular biology of virus infection. In August of 2007, Dr. tenOever joined the Icahn School of Medicine in New York as an Assistant Professor of Microbiology where he is now a Fishberg Professor of Medicine, and the Director of the Virus Engineering Center for Therapeutic and Research (VECToR). He is a 2008 Pew Scholar, a recipient of the 2009 Presidential Award in Science and Engineering, a 2010 recipient of the American Society of Microbiology Young Investigator Award, a 2011 Cozzarelli Prize winner, and he received the Burroughs Wellcome Award for his work regarding the pathogenesis of infectious disease. More specifically, the lab focuses on what constitutes different cellular defense systems, how these systems have been shaped over time, and how viruses circumvent them and cause disease.

Sean Whelan is a British-American virologist. He is known for identifying the cellular protein used as a receptor by Ebola virus,  for defining the entry pathway that rabies virus uses to enter neurons, and for identifying the ribosome as a possible target for antiviral drugs. He performed his PhD work with noted virologist Jeffrey Almond, then at the University of Reading. Career \n\nWhelan joined Harvard Medical School's Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in 2002. He served as head of Harvard's PhD Program in Virology, and directed an NIH-funded Center for Excellence in Translational Research. Whelan's research focuses on using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model system for negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as the rabies, measles and Ebola viruses. He began this work as a post-doc in the laboratory of Professor Gail Wertz, developing a system for expressing infectious VSV particles from cDNA clones, which led to a patent on VSV-based gene therapy vectors and vaccines. Whelan has used this approach to study the entry process of Ebola, to identify the cellular protein the virus uses as a receptor, and to study how the rabies virus infects neurons.

Explosions rocked the carrier, but Bradley, the ship's assistant first lieutenant, led a repair party and battled the blaze on the second and third decks.

The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance, but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British, who were soon at war with the Americans in the War of 1812. Despite their overall stance as allies for the Americans, a handful of Arapaho warriors fought against the United States in key battles during the war. Like in previous wars, the US recruited Indian warriors from tribes that were enemies with the Arapaho–Cheyenne–Lakota–Dakota alliance to act as Indian scouts, most notably from the Crow, Arikara, and Shoshone. Many tribes fought American settlers at one time or another, from the Utes of the Great Basin to the Nez Perce tribe of Idaho. It was known infrequently as the Miami Confederacy since many contemporaneous federal officials overestimated the influence and numerical strength of the Miami tribes based on the size of their principal city, Kekionga. The confederacy, which had its roots in pan-tribal movements dating to the 1740s, formed in an attempt to resist the expansion of the United States and the encroachment of American settlers into the Northwest Territory after Great Britain ceded the region to the U.S. in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. American expansion resulted in the Northwest Indian War (1785–1795), in which the Confederacy won significant victories over the United States, but concluded with an U.S. victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Confederacy became fractured and agreed to peace with the United States, but the pan-tribal resistance was later rekindled by Tenskwatawa (known as the Prophet) and his brother, Tecumseh, resulting in the formation of the Tecumseh's confederacy. Indian agent John Johnston restored peace and provided the Shawnees with food to get through the winter.\n\nQuestion: In what century did this Native warrior and chief, whose brother Tenskwatawa led the Tippecanoe order of battle, become the primary leader of a large, multi tribal confederacy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Specifically, the invention concerns a reinforced bone graft substitute. U.S. Patent No. 4,878,915 to Brantigan teaches a solid metal plug. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,044,104; 5,026,373 and 4,961,740 to Ray; 5,015,247 to Michelson and U.S. Patent No. 4,820,305 to Harms et al. teach hollow metal cage structures. Surface porosity in such solid implants does not correct this problem because it will not allow sufficient ingrowth to provide a solid bone mass strong enough to withstand the loads of the spine. On the other hand, the hollow cage structures of Harms, Ray and Michelson allow ingrowth. These devices can also be filled with bone graft material to promote bone growth. Unfortunately, many of these devices are difficult to machine and therefore expensive. The supply of allograft material, which is obtained from donors of the same species, is not limited. However, allografts are also disadvantageous because of the risk of disease transmission and immune reactions. Furthermore, allogenic bone does not have the osteogenic potential of autogenous bone and therefore will give only temporary support. Calcium phosphate ceramics are biocompatible and do not present the infectious or immunological concerns of allograft materials. Ceramics may be prepared in any quantity which is a great advantage over autograft bone graft material. Furthermore, bioceramics are osteoconductive, stimulating osteogenesis in boney sites, and are also thought to be osteogenic, able to initiate osteogenesis in non-boney sites. Bioceramics provide a porous matrix which further encourages new bone growth. Unfortunately, ceramic implants lack the strength to support high spinal loads and therefore require separate fixation before the fusion. One attempt in overcoming the poor compressive strength of bioceramics is disclosed in International Publication No. WO 96/40014. Of the calcium phosphate ceramics, hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate ceramics have been most commonly used for bone grafting. Hydroxyapatite is chemically similar to inorganic bone substance and biocompatible with bone. According to the present invention, there is provided an interbody fusion spacer comprising a body having an outer surface and a height approximating the height of a human disc space and a slecve engaged to said outer surface of said body, said sleeve including a material relatively stronger under compression than said body, characterized in that said body is composed of a deactivated bone material including collagen or gelatin and naturally associated bone minerals and that said deactivated bone material is essentially free of non-collagenous proteins. The body includes a porous biocompatible material for permitting tissue ingrowth therethrough. In one specific embodiment of the invention, there is provided a plurality of apertures through the sleeve in communication with the outer surface of the body for bone ingrowth.

SWNT are in use as an experimental material for removable, structural bridge panels. In 2015, researchers incorporated CNTs and graphene into spider silk, increasing its strength and toughness to a new record. The resulting silk had a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young’s modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers. forest spinning or drawing methods may compete with carbon fiber for high-end uses, especially in weight-sensitive applications requiring combined electrical and mechanical functionality. Research yarns made from few-walled CNTs have reached a stiffness of 357 GPa and a strength of 8.8 GPa for a gauge length comparable to the millimeter-long CNTs within the yarn. Because the probability of a critical flaw increases with volume, yarns may never achieve the strength of individual CNTs. However, CNT's high surface area may provide interfacial coupling that mitigates these deficiencies. CNT yarns can be knotted without loss of strength.

The early settlers called it the \"craneberry.\" According to folklore, Native Americans used it for food, fabric dye and medicinal purposes and introduced this healthy fruit to the Pilgrims.1 Although currently harvested in water through flooding the bogs, cranberries do not grow in water. Instead, they grow on vines in impermeable beds layered with sand, gravel, and clay.They require an acid peat soil, an adequate fresh water supply, sand and a growing season that stretches from April to November, with a dormancy period in the winter months that provides an extended chilling period, necessary to mature fruiting buds.Some of the original cranberry bogs were found in Massachusetts and New Jersey, with working vines that are well over 100 years old. **Key Finding:** \"This study reveals the prolongevity effects of oregano and cranberry mixture and supports the emerging view that benefits botanicals on aging. \"2010 Jan;65(1):41-50.J Gerontol A Sci Med Sci.### **Aging**\n\n_Prolongevity effects of an oregano and cranberry extract are diet dependent in the Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens)._ Zou S, Carey JR, Lideo P, Et al. ## **Cranberries**\n\nTraditional Thanksgiving Menus in North America typically include cranberries, which are produced by low, creeping shrubs that grow wild in acidic bogs.

The early settlers called it the \"craneberry.\" According to folklore, Native Americans used it for food, fabric dye and medicinal purposes and introduced this healthy fruit to the Pilgrims.1 Although currently harvested in water through flooding the bogs, cranberries do not grow in water. Instead, they grow on vines in impermeable beds layered with sand, gravel, and clay.They require an acid peat soil, an adequate fresh water supply, sand and a growing season that stretches from April to November, with a dormancy period in the winter months that provides an extended chilling period, necessary to mature fruiting buds.Some of the original cranberry bogs were found in Massachusetts and New Jersey, with working vines that are well over 100 years old. **Key Finding:** \"This study reveals the prolongevity effects of oregano and cranberry mixture and supports the emerging view that benefits botanicals on aging. \"2010 Jan;65(1):41-50.J Gerontol A Sci Med Sci.### **Aging**\n\n_Prolongevity effects of an oregano and cranberry extract are diet dependent in the Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens)._ Zou S, Carey JR, Lideo P, Et al. ## **Cranberries**\n\nTraditional Thanksgiving Menus in North America typically include cranberries, which are produced by low, creeping shrubs that grow wild in acidic bogs.

Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better.

Thompson collaborated with composer Richard Marx on Josh Groban's first hit record, \"To Where You Are\", with composer Steve Dorff on the Celine Dion hit \"Miracle\", with Andreas Carlsson for \"Drowning\" by the Backstreet Boys, and composer David Foster on several compositions, including \"No Explanation\" for the film Pretty Woman (1990), and \"I Have Nothing\" for the film The Bodyguard (1992), for which they were nominated both for the Academy Award for Best Song in 1993 and \n\n At the 1992 Oscars, Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, and Peabo Bryson sang a composite of both versions from the film, backed by dancers dressed as Belle and the Beast.

Each of the 3 respective artists have performed the song in concerts later in their careers, outside the context of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Similarly, Dion and Bryson duetted at the JT Super Producers 94 tribute concert to David Foster, and as part of Dion's 1994-95 The Colour of My Love Tour, though they have also often sung with different duet partners.\n\n"

His early contributions to economics were in pure economic theory – on marginal utility, complementarity, hierarchical structures of wants and the pervasive Austrian School issue of time. He then moved to the World Bank, before moving on to MIT, where he was a professor from 1953 to 1968. Rabbi Friedman co-chaired the Steering Committee and was secretary of its national Bet Din.\n\n"

On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill as prime minister, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that Mountbatten-Windsor would be the surname of her and her husband's male-line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as prince or princess. While it seems the Queen had \"absolutely set her heart\" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only 11 days before the birth of Prince Andrew (19 February), and only after three months of protracted correspondence between constitutional expert Edward Iwi (who averred that, without such\n\n"

Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses Medical Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS.

AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages Available forms The AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others that have also been available and used\n\nAnabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses Medical Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS.

Anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), including testosterone and its esters, have also been taken to enhance muscle development, strength, or endurance. After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as Ben Johnson's improved performance at the 1988 Summer Olympics), prohibitions of AAS use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. Testosterone and \n\nBodybuilders and athletes may use prohormones for several reasons. Prohormones are substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body, providing similar benefits to taking anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) without the legal risks associated with them. They are often used to enhance muscle growth, increase strength and power, improve athletic performance, and accelerate recovery from intense training or injuries. These compounds are believed to undergo enzymatic changes within the body, converting into active hormones that interact with androgen receptors to produce anabolic effects. By mimicking the actions of AAS, prohormones aim to enhance muscle protein synthesis, promote nitrogen retention, and inhibit muscle breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and improved physical performance. The Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 established regulatory control over AAS and certain androgen prohormones, categorizing them as controlled substances. It is crucial to consult with medical professionals or experts in sports medicine before considering the use of prohormones or any performance-enhancing substances.

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album. To date, it is the last studio album Taylor has released, and he has been performing songs form the album on his current concert tour. Additionally, guests Sting and Yo-Yo Ma appear on the album, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s album chart when it was released. Additional episodes currently being produced include an interview with the author of a new biography about\n\n atmosphere and the ghosts of many a raised glass\" and \"an endearing mix of country soul and late night jazz\". During the subsequent tour, the duo opened for Kinky Friedman and The Handsome Family. The album was self-produced and recorded in Sydney over one day by Wade Keighran with musicians Ken Gormly from The Cruel Sea, Cec Condon from The Mess Hall on drums and Sam Worrad on guitar. I think for our real fans, this is going to be a gigantic treat, because our fans have clamored for a live album for years, and for people who don't know us or don't know us as well, to listen to this makes them go, \"Oh wow, these guys are still sounding great, holy cow.\" I think it's going to be a good project for us all around.\" This collaboration was recorded with Sing-Off-winning, country a cappella group Home Free, who uploaded the video to their \n\n Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Etta James. After relocating to Georgia while her partner, actor Aden Young shot Sundance television series Rectify, Carmen recorded and released The Peach State (2012), a suite of solo country songs, recorded in Nashville with long time Johnny Cash engineer David Ferguson. Also included are Parton's covers of the Mac Davis-penned Elvis Presley hit \"In the Ghetto\" and Joe South's \"Games People Play\". She also covered current country hits by Porter Wagoner (\"Big Wind\") and Jan Howard (\"We Had All the Good Things Going\"). In a CMT interview with Patty Loveless, Parton confirmed that the man on the album cover is her reclusive husband, Carl Dean.\n\nQuestion: Candy Coburn has shared the stage with an American country music group with who playing guitar?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. In a new interview with journalist Robert Neil, Boone talks about the unusual circumstances that created the opportunity to record “You Light Up My Life,” and the odd path that followed. In her typically good-natured way, Boone jokes about how ‘green’ she was at that time and how her desire to sing in a variety of styles ultimately left her with a ‘branding’ problem. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career. The latest episode of Documenting Popular Music takes a look at Rita Coolidge’s latest album, Safe in the Arms of Time. The album was produced by Ross Hogarth and is on Blue Ělan Records, a company quietly gaining a reputation as an artists’ label, because of the way it embraces performers of all ages and genres. Coolidge says Blue Ělan reminds her of her days at A&M Records, when Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss were running the independent label as an artist friendly, family company. Included in the review, presented by journalist Robert Neil, is a brief look at Coolidge’s career in the 70s and 80s. The gene, which incorporated elements of smooth jazz and soul, is making a comeback, and a group helping to make the past current is Young Gun Silver Fox. The band is made up of Andy Platts and Shawn Lee, who are not recording cover versions of 80s songs, but are creating new material that sounds like it was originally recorded from that era. They duo has a new album out called ‘AM Waves,’ and guys are so skilled at what they’re doing that if you didn’t know better, you would think you were listening to songs you somehow missed 35 years ago. In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before.

Introduction Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing countries in Africa, having more than 104 million people (the second most-populous in the region). It experiences the public health problems typical of an underdeveloped country, such as communicable diseases (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis etc), maternal and child health problems (diarrhoea & dehydration, pneumonia, neonatal problems etc) and malnutrition; these account for the majority of public health problems. History In Ethiopia, the quest for modern medicine beyond traditional practice started during Emperor Lebnedingil’s reign in the 15th century, when the emperor appealed to the Portuguese king for physicians and surgeons to cure illnesses. The first Ethiopian hospital was established in 1897, the Ministry of Health in 1948 and the first medical school in the country opened in 1964. It was only during Emperor Menelik’s time (1889-1913) that the first foreign-trained Ethiopian medical doctor, Hakim Workneh Eshete, began practicing medicine in Addis Ababa. Statistics: Health care financing The current Ethiopia health care financing strategy focus on financing of primary health care services in a sustainable manner. According to the 6th National Health Accounts (2013/14), health service in Ethiopia is primarily financed from 4 sources: the federal and regional governments; grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral donors; non-governmental organizations and private contributions. The main purchasers of health service in Ethiopia are: the Ministry of Health; Regional Health Bureaus; District/Woreda Health Offices in the form of line-item budgets; Ethiopia Health Insurance Agency; and, other government entities that transfer budget to service providers to reimburse service delivery cost; and households in the form of user fee. History of development Throughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrolments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, but since outlays for health have grown steadily. Its major themes focussed on: Democratization and decentralization of health system; Expanding the primary health care system and emphasizing preventive, promotional, and basic curative health services; and Encouraging partnerships and the participation of the community and nongovernmental actors. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries. Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008.

Later, Jake and Terry stage Adrian's murder and deliver false evidence of his death to the man who ordered the hit. They trail him to an FBI building, and discern that he is an agent. The precinct decides to secretly find the mole while Pimento goes into hiding. Later Dexter begins to see visions on his \"Headcase\" TV which suggest he is a wanted serial killer, the Blemvoi Butcher. The Butcher lures the pair and two police officers, including the \"by-the-book\" Tracey Weld, into a trap. There he labored on DNA splicing in an effort to create a flawless human being. His ultimate goal was to create an army of obedient assassins.\n\n"

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. Over several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015.

Release The first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015.

In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press.

Accolades Controversies Family members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. As you sit in his office, detailing your aches and pains for the umpteenth time, a shadow of concern flits across his face. For a moment, you aren't concerned with the potential risks, you want the pain G-O-N-E. Then you are reminded of a close friend, who also battled chronic pain late in life. One of the most successful has been hypnosis. As images from stage shows with people clucking like a chicken or scenes in movies where the watch swings from the hand of the sinister hypnosis jump to their mind. True, it wasn’t very long ago that hypnosis was associated with superstition and bad Hollywood films, but today, it’s supported by a large body of scientific research. The key being that you truly want to change, as unlike the sinister hypnotist in the movies, no one can be hypnotized to do anything they don’t want to. At all time you are completely safe and always in control. It is in this extremely relaxing and pleasurable state where your subconscious is open to new suggestions and the transformation begins to take place. They share feelings of happiness, calm, and relaxation.

University of Minnesota Health Clinical Nurse Specialist Michael Petty discusses quality of life for patients, current health research and his patient care philosophy. Clinical Nurse Specialist Michael Petty has worked in nursing for more then three decades. Now, he is focused on advanced heart failure, heart transplantation and related issues. When Michael Petty, PhD, RN, APRN-CNS, started his career as a nurse more than three decades ago, open heart surgery patients could expect to spend two to three weeks in the hospital. That’s just one of many changes Petty, a University of Minnesota Health cardiothoracic clinical nurse specialist, has witnessed in his long career. Petty is a recipient of the American Heart Association’s 2015 Heart and Stroke Hero Award for Medical Professionals. We spoke with him to learn more about his new research project, the rapidly changing nature of medicine and health science and his approach to patient care. In what ways have healthcare delivery and your work in this field changed over time? We are always learning something new, and I find it fascinating. How do you encourage patients to become active participants in their care?

In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Will Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast. It received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Filming Principal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Music James Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\". Release The first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games. In the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized. Accolades Controversies Family members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. As you sit in his office, detailing your aches and pains for the umpteenth time, a shadow of concern flits across his face. For a moment, you aren't concerned with the potential risks, you want the pain G-O-N-E. Then you are reminded of a close friend, who also battled chronic pain late in life. One of the most successful has been hypnosis. As images from stage shows with people clucking like a chicken or scenes in movies where the watch swings from the hand of the sinister hypnosis jump to their mind. True, it wasn’t very long ago that hypnosis was associated with superstition and bad Hollywood films, but today, it’s supported by a large body of scientific research. The key being that you truly want to change, as unlike the sinister hypnotist in the movies, no one can be hypnotized to do anything they don’t want to. At all time you are completely safe and always in control. It is in this extremely relaxing and pleasurable state where your subconscious is open to new suggestions and the transformation begins to take place. They share feelings of happiness, calm, and relaxation.

University of Minnesota Health Clinical Nurse Specialist Michael Petty discusses quality of life for patients, current health research and his patient care philosophy. Clinical Nurse Specialist Michael Petty has worked in nursing for more then three decades. Now, he is focused on advanced heart failure, heart transplantation and related issues. When Michael Petty, PhD, RN, APRN-CNS, started his career as a nurse more than three decades ago, open heart surgery patients could expect to spend two to three weeks in the hospital. That’s just one of many changes Petty, a University of Minnesota Health cardiothoracic clinical nurse specialist, has witnessed in his long career. Petty is a recipient of the American Heart Association’s 2015 Heart and Stroke Hero Award for Medical Professionals. We spoke with him to learn more about his new research project, the rapidly changing nature of medicine and health science and his approach to patient care. In what ways have healthcare delivery and your work in this field changed over time? We are always learning something new, and I find it fascinating. How do you encourage patients to become active participants in their care? Roaming the internet, I found some before and after photos of one person’s experiments with using the milky sap of petty spurge. Doesn’t all this just beg for further investigation? All I can say is WOW . I am an Australian woman recently retired and living in Gold Coast Queensland. I am of Irish descent with red hair and freckles. Thanks for the input from down under. Reaction was quick and dramatic. This year, I’m working on another section of my face, and I’m in the middle of the process. Personally, I think it’s totally worth doing. Delighted to hear about your experiences. I am a fair skinned redhead, raised on a farm during the great depression with no skin protection from the sun. I only tried petty spurge the one time as described in the post. I’ll have to tell my daughter about you. She has petty spurge on her property (in the spring, God willing) and might like to communicate. Concussion is a 2015 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the exposé \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published in 2009 by GQ magazine. Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. Over several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.

The franchise began in 1956 as a television game show hosted by Bill Cullen and was revamped in 1972. This version was originally hosted by Bob Barker. Since 2007, Drew Carey has hosted the program. It originally aired on ITV from 24 March 1984 to 8 April 1988 and was hosted by Leslie Crowther. The show later briefly moved to Sky One for one series as The New Price is Right from 4 September 1989 to 31 August 1990 with Bob Warman as the host. The show returned to ITV in 1995 hosted by Bruce Forsyth. It returned to ITV, as Bruce's Price is Right, from 4 September 1995 to 16 December 2001 with Bruce Forsyth hosting for seven series, and again\n\n"

He and Camillo Golgi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906. Biography Santiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain. Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. He took part in an expedition to Cuba in 1874–75, where he contracted malaria and tuberculosis. To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town Panticosa in the Pyrenees mountain range. Two years later, he became the director of the Zaragoza Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the University of Valencia. In 1887 Ramón y Cajal moved to Barcelona for a professorship. In 1899 he became director of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene – translated as National Institute of Hygiene , and in 1922 founder of the – translated as the Laboratory of Biological Investigations , later renamed to the , or Cajal Institute. Political and religious views In 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a Masonic lodge. John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal \"was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion\". Discoveries and theories Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). Distinctions Ramón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including honorary doctorates in medicine from Cambridge University and Würzburg University and an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Clark University. Even before Ramón y Cajal's work, Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite. In society and culture In 1906 Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida painted Cajal's official portrait celebrating his Nobel Prize win.

The film stars Harry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon, a doctor who is trying to find a cure for breast cancer. The film also stars Paula Cale, Angie Harmon and Amanda Bynes in supporting roles. Plot\nThe film follows the true story of Dr. Dennis Slamon (played by Harry Connick, Jr.), who helped develop the breast cancer drug Herceptin, over the course of 8 years from 1988 to 1996. However, when the drug company stops funding the research, philanthropists, including Lilly Tartikoff (Angie Harmon) and Ronald Perelman help him continue drug reseach. Although her mother Elizabeth (Swoosie Kurtz) pleads with Dr. Slamon, Nicole is not included in the subsequent trials as she does not meet the trial requirements. They handle their disease and drug trial, with humor—Tish (Jennifer Coolidge), or with alternative therapy—Tina (Trudie Styler). The stories of Barbara (Bernadette Peters) and Ellie (Regina King) are followed throughout, as they go through the trials and eventual recovery. Cast\nHarry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon\nPaula Cale as Donna Slamon, Dr. Slamon's wife\nAngie Harmon as Lilly Tartikoff, wife of Brandon Tartikoff (NBC Television president)\nAmanda Bynes as Jamie, Dr. Slamon's student assistant\nBernadette Peters as Barbara Bradfield, a retired art teacher and the first woman the drug trial saved by Herceptin\nRegina King as Ellie, a fashion designer and breast cancer survivor\nJohn Benjamin Hickey as Blake Rogers, Dr. Slamon's friend and fellow scientist\nSwoosie Kurtz as Elizabeth, Nicole's mother\nMelissa McBride as Sally\nTammy Blanchard as Nicole, the first woman to receive Herceptin\nAmy Madigan as Fran Visco, President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition\nTrudie Styler as Tina, participant in Phase One of the Her2 study\nJennifer Coolidge as Tish, participant in Phase One of the Her2 study\nBruce McKinnon as Dean Bradfield, Barbara Bradfield's loving husband\nLance E. Nichols as Dr. Brown, Barbara's physician\nRhoda Griffis as Bindy Hawn, a member of the Revlon charity board\nWilliam Ragsdale as Andy Marks\n\nNote: the women patients portrayed are composites with the exception of Barbara Bradfield. Soundtrack \nHarry Connick, Jr. has written \"Song for the Hopeful\". Sony has announced it will give a contribution to breast cancer charities, for each download of \"Song for the Hopeful\" (Theme from \"Living Proof\") from iTunes, where it was released on October 7, 2008. Production \nTeleplay writer Vivienne Radkoff had the story for about seven years before it was completed. The film was the first mainstream feature film to be scored as a solo project by composer Halli Cauthery. Renée Zellweger, in her first television project, is executive producer, with Neil Meron and Craig Zadan producers. Filming of Living Proof took place in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2008. A red carpet premiere evening screening took place in New York on September 24, 2008, with a reception following with Harry Connick, Jr. and Bernadette Peters performing. Critical reception \nVariety wrote: \"Earnest, emotional and cast to the hilt with cameos for actresses, \"Living Proof\" rises above most Lifetime movie fare...There's also some nice camaraderie among the women patients, who are introduced as the song \"Say a Little Prayer\" appropriately plays in the background.

The film stars Harry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon, a doctor who is trying to find a cure for breast cancer. The film also stars Paula Cale, Angie Harmon and Amanda Bynes in supporting roles. Plot\nThe film follows the true story of Dr. Dennis Slamon (played by Harry Connick, Jr.), who helped develop the breast cancer drug Herceptin, over the course of 8 years from 1988 to 1996. However, when the drug company stops funding the research, philanthropists, including Lilly Tartikoff (Angie Harmon) and Ronald Perelman help him continue drug reseach. Although her mother Elizabeth (Swoosie Kurtz) pleads with Dr. Slamon, Nicole is not included in the subsequent trials as she does not meet the trial requirements. They handle their disease and drug trial, with humor—Tish (Jennifer Coolidge), or with alternative therapy—Tina (Trudie Styler). The stories of Barbara (Bernadette Peters) and Ellie (Regina King) are followed throughout, as they go through the trials and eventual recovery.

No one told me it would more than likely come back. I thought only if you were at a later stage, you had a bigger chance of that happening? It was quite a shock to find out it came back! Besides it being on the oppocite side, the other difference was that three nodes were affected this time. Again, not in any other place (ie: not in bone marrow, etc.). Both times, it was caught in the early stages. It also had something about \"of germinal ?) which I was told had a better prognosis. So more transplant patients may reply over there than here? You said you had a transplant (allo) after your second relapse. How many relapses have you had and how long has it been since your transplant? It is mostly centered in my skin, but life is still worth living! You sure have been \"through the wringer.\" Some where, I read your whole cancer journey. I admire your strength and attitude through it all. You seem very knowledgable about this cancer stuff. I'm glad you're on these forums sharing that knowledge and helping others out. Also nice to know someone else who has had a transplant (& at the SCCA as I have!). How long might that last? Whatever I have learned has been the hard way! Regarding cancer, I was totally naîve when all of this began. The learning curve has been steep and I may know a little, but there are mountains more to learn. In a former life, I used to encourage prisoners who had lost hope - but all of that was taken away when I found that first tumor. However, when God closes a door, He opens a window. Thus, it occurred to me that cancer patients are another group which in many have lost hope. My journey has been absolutely providential. Like I said, providential. My donor/son has a hyper-vigilant immune system and after 18 drugs in 9 regimens, that is precisely what I needed to eradicate those two persistent cancers.

I think there is so much information out there for patients to have to sort through, that they're going to need some help in trying to find the best possible management for them. Critics say, as a result, they need to see more evidence. MARCIA BRAZDA: But more data is on the way.

Then she got sick. GWEN COOKE: I sort of got the agent on one day, and got the diagnosis the next. ANDREW HOLTZ: Gwen was diagnosed with cancer, a cancer that cannot be cured. GWEN COOKE: We're used to having an illness and getting better, and that's not going to happen with me. ANDREW HOLTZ: As an Oregonian, Gwen has the right to ask a physician to help end her life. But she's not doing that, in part because of the care she gets from hospice workers who visit her at home.

SUSAN TOLLE, MD, OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY: We're doing a better job than most other sates, by most measures: more hospice, more respect for refusal of treatment, more people who want to die at home getting to die at home.

Stranger still, it seems to be moving under its own will; it is an intelligent being itself.

No one told me it would more than likely come back. I thought only if you were at a later stage, you had a bigger chance of that happening? It was quite a shock to find out it came back! Besides it being on the oppocite side, the other difference was that three nodes were affected this time. Again, not in any other place (ie: not in bone marrow, etc.). Both times, it was caught in the early stages. It also had something about \"of germinal ?) which I was told had a better prognosis. So more transplant patients may reply over there than here? You said you had a transplant (allo) after your second relapse. How many relapses have you had and how long has it been since your transplant? It is mostly centered in my skin, but life is still worth living! You sure have been \"through the wringer.\" Some where, I read your whole cancer journey. I admire your strength and attitude through it all. You seem very knowledgable about this cancer stuff. I'm glad you're on these forums sharing that knowledge and helping others out. Also nice to know someone else who has had a transplant (& at the SCCA as I have!). How long might that last? Whatever I have learned has been the hard way! Regarding cancer, I was totally naîve when all of this began. The learning curve has been steep and I may know a little, but there are mountains more to learn. In a former life, I used to encourage prisoners who had lost hope - but all of that was taken away when I found that first tumor. However, when God closes a door, He opens a window. Thus, it occurred to me that cancer patients are another group which in many have lost hope. My journey has been absolutely providential. Like I said, providential. My donor/son has a hyper-vigilant immune system and after 18 drugs in 9 regimens, that is precisely what I needed to eradicate those two persistent cancers. Son and daughter are the only known individuals on earth who could donate. Keep in mind that we form our own personal statistic - that is all that matters. To be able to say \"I saved Dad's life\" is grand! They told me the stats (not long-term ones, though), but added that being younger, being caught at an earlier stage than most, and having my cancer respond well to chemo, hopefully, I will beat the stats. There are so many variables, nobody knows what may happen; there is always hope, so don't give up no matter what! First time was in 2013, large diffuse B cell, R-CHOP worked and I went into remission. My brother matched 9/10 and my daughter matched 5/10 but they want to use her Instead of my brother, a procedure called haploidentical transplant - is that what you had? how long were you in the hospital for the transplant and how long did you have to follow up at the facility?\n\n"

Strom Thurmond Dam, also known in Georgia as Clarks Hill Dam, is a concrete-gravity and embankment dam located 22 mi north of Augusta, Georgia on the Savannah River at the border of South Carolina and Georgia, creating Lake Strom Thurmond. The dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1946 and 1954 for the purposes of flood control, hydroelectricity and downstream navigation. The concrete structure of the dam spans 1096 ft and rises 204 ft above the riverbed, housing a power plant with an installed 380 MW capacity. The Dam has prevented over $185,000 \n\n The Ashley River is a blackwater and tidal river in South Carolina, rising from the Wassamassaw and Great Cypress Swamps in western Berkeley County. It consolidates its main channel about five miles west of Summerville, widening into a tidal estuary just south of Fort Dorchester. The river then flows for approximately 17 miles along the historical banks of the City of North Charleston before reaching peninsular Charleston. The much wider Ashley joins the Cooper River off the Battery in Charleston to form Charleston Harbor before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n"

Whether on store shelves, at farmers’ markets, or “cultured” at home, fermented foods are making a comeback that could be good for the American gut, the experts say. “Fermented foods provide the body with good bacteria that cannot be duplicated in a pill,” says Fields, who frequently recommends her patients substitute kefir, a fermented beverage, for probiotic pills. Here’s a quick primer for anyone interested in joining the fermented-food trend. Adding fermented foods to the diet can boost immunity and decrease inflammation, with some studies suggesting they might improve conditions such as colitis, IBS, leaky gut, gastric reflux and high cholesterol. Fields and Hodkins advise starting with smaller portions – a couple of tablespoons to only a few ounces per day ̶ to reap healthful benefits. Live fermented foods can be consumed daily, but megadosing could lead to stomach pain, cramping or diarrhea. Fermented foods are fine for most people seeking general health support, but those with gastritis, acid reflux, ulcers, and other gastric issues and serious medical conditions should consult their doctor. Yogurt, a cultured dairy product containing probiotics, is widely popular today, including regular and Greek versions.

Kefir (pronounced “kee’- fur,​” “kuh-feer’,” or “keh’-fur”), a tangy dairy beverage, is most-commonly known as a “drinkable yogurt.” It originates from the Caucasus Mountains in Eastern Europe and is considered a super power in probiotics, because it has more microflora than yogurt ̶ about 50 strains, including bacteria and yeast, says Hodkins. Traditional kefir is cultured with “kefir grains,” a culture of lumpy clumps of beneficial bacteria and yeasts that technically aren’t a “grain.” ​Dairy kefir is a good source of calcium and protein and is traditionally made from cow’s or goat’s milk, but now almond and soy milk varieties are available. Water kefir is a lighter drink made from kefir grains​ (small, translucent-looking crystals) fermented in sugar water, juice, or even coconut water. It was traditionally made with black tea and sugar, but today green tea and honey are also used. ​ Modern “kvass” also refers to sour tonic beverages,​ fermented from vegetables and fruits, that are not the bread-based version. Sauerkraut, kimchi and other fermented vegetables are all microflora-rich when they are made using traditional lacto-fermentation techniques that combine vegetables and salt to produce naturally-occurring healthy bacteria. The process does not involve any dairy; the “lacto” refers to the lactic acid produced during fermentation. Fermented soy products receive mixed reviews from wellness experts. Äyrän (ayran) is a dairy drink made by diluting qatıq (katyk, sour milk) with cold water. Another non-alcoholic sweet beverage is şirbät (sherbet) made from honey.

It is made by fermenting sugar water with kefir grains and can be flavored with fruits or herbs. Fruity Water Kefir: You can add various fruits, such as berries or citrus, to water kefir during the fermentation process to create a fruity and refreshing probiotic beverage. By using yogurt culture and milk, you can make your own homemade yogurt with live and active cultures. Homemade Almond Milk: While not a fermented beverage itself, you can use homemade almond milk as a base for smoothies or as an ingredient in other probiotic-rich recipes.

Reagan was succeeded by his vice president, George H. W. Bush, who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan's support.

Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos. In the aftermath of the Reagan era Iran–Contra affair, \n\n  Having served in various government positions, particularly the position of Director of the CIA, Bush sought the presidential nomination in the 1980 Republican primaries. Seeking to balance the ticket with an ideological moderate, Reagan selected Bush as his running mate.

Bush enjoyed warm relations with Reagan, and the vice president served as an important adviser and made numerous public appearances on behalf of the Reagan administration.\n\n"

Specifically, aldosterone stimulates the resorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephron. This leads to an increase in the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream, thereby promoting the retention of sodium by the body. Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels. As aldosterone levels increase, it leads to an increase in blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume, thereby inhibiting the release of renin. It acts on the distal tubules of the nephron in the kidney, as well as other sites like the gastric mucosa, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Through its actions, aldosterone helps to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as blood pressure regulation. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, has several effects on the kidneys. The main effects of aldosterone on the kidneys occur in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. In other words, it promotes the retention of sodium and the excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Additionally, aldosterone stimulates sodium retention in the distal colon and sweat glands through its receptors. The release of renin from the kidneys leads to the production of angiotensin II, which stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can also stimulate aldosterone secretion. Reference:\n- The adrenal cortex comprises three main zones, or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones. In one study, transgenic mice over expressing this membrane protein were shown to have increased reabsorption and retention of sodium after increased salt intake. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. It primarily acts on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidney. This hormone influences the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium, indirectly affecting water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, interferes with the aldosterone receptor and has a similar effect. Reference: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above.
