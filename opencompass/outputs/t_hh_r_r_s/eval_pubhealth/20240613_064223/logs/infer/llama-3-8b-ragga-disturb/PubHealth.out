Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.

 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.

COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.

Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

Nomenclature

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The Director-General, Tedros Adhanom explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for 2019, the year in which the outbreak was first identified. The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications.

Signs and symptoms

Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Transmission

Virology

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.

Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 variants

The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. At the present time, the expert group convened by WHO has recommended the labeling of variants using letters of the Greek Alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences." Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR). The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.

Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020. Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark. After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.

, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.

Pathophysiology

The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.

Respiratory tract
Following viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.

Nervous system
One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.

Gastrointestinal tract
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.

Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease. Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function. A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in people transferred to Intensive care units (ICU) with COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge.

Other organs
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.

Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.

Immunopathology

Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.

Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.

Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.

Viral and host factors

Virus proteins

Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which are heptad repeat regions. Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines.

The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response.

Host factors
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.

The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses.

It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19.

Host cytokine response

The severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease.

A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon.

Pregnancy response
There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.

Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:
 Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the fetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy.
 Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions.
 Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.

However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.

In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.

Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated.

Diagnosis

COVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.

Viral testing

The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited." The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. Results are generally available within hours. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.

Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" On 7September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".

Imaging

Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection. Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses. Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.

Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.

Coding
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pathology
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
 Macroscopy: pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
 Lung findings:
 minor serous exudation, minor fibrin exudation
 pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
 diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates. DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
 organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
 plasmocytosis in BAL
 Blood and vessels: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction, endotheliitis, hemophagocytosis
 Heart: cardiac muscle cell necrosis
 Liver: microvesicular steatosis
 Nose: shedding of olfactory epithelium
 Brain: infarction
 Kidneys: acute tubular damage.
 Spleen: white pulp depletion.

Prevention

Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.

The first COVID‑19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2December 2020 by the UK medicines regulator MHRA. It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.

Vaccine

Face masks and respiratory hygiene

The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection. But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any certification they can have. So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.

Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID‑19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.

Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces
The CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided. When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission. The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.

Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.

Displacement ventilation with large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust in laminar flow while significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles. Passive ventilation reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lack controllability and heat recovery. Displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. The use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air.

Hand-washing and hygiene

Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required. The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose. When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol. For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis." Glycerol is added as a humectant.

Social distancing

Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.

Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing. In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.

Surface cleaning
After being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection. Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes. Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticized as hygiene theater, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.

The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).

On many surfaces, including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions. On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours. The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.

The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission. The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used. A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inocuylum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.

Self-isolation

Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.

Healthy diet and lifestyle
The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep.

Consistently meeting scientific guidelines of 150+ minutes per week of exercise or similar physical activity was shown to be associated with a smaller risk of hospitalisation and death due to COVID‑19, even when considering likely risk factors such as elevated Body mass index (BMI).

A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that "Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms." The largest observational study on the subject using online questionnaires, with over 6,000 participants and a dosage regime near the RDI, is set to conclude in July 2021. One of the collaborators in the study is Synergy Biologics Ltd, a manufacturer of vitamin D3 supplements.

International travel-related control measures 
A 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19. Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening.

Treatment

Prognosis

The severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU.

Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects." He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organsincluding the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achieving herd immunity by infection, rather than vaccination, is "morally unconscionable and unfeasible".

In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19.

It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. One research that looked into the COVID‑19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.

Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19. Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.

Children

While very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalized children were admitted to the ICU, while a European multinational study of hospitalized children from June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care. Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be "substantially lower" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.

Complications

Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism. Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.

Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions). Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status.

In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.

Fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19.

Longer-term effects

Some early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.

By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. In people requiring hospital admission, up to 98% of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically improved.

People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.

Immunity

The immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.

Reinfection with COVID‑19 is possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021.

Mortality

Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.

The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly. In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries' populations. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US.

Case fatality rate 
The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is  (/) as of . The number varies by region.

Infection fatality rate
A key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.

Estimates

A December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO.

An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza.

Earlier estimates of IFR
At an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%. On 2July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected). As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population). Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%. In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died. In September 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.

Sex differences

COVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries. However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men. Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die. One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58).

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders. One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors. Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. In Europe as of February 2020, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID‑19 were men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.

Ethnic differences
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups. Structural factors that prevent them from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death. Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities. On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent. According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults. The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.

Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities. In the UK, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background. More severe impacts upon victims including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalization requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Karolinska Institutet. This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in Southern Europe.

Comorbidities
Biological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases. According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), Ischemic Heart Disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).

Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis. Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.

In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases and 1.4 million TB-related deaths by 2025.

History

The virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. The possibility that the virus was accidentally released from a laboratory is also under increasingly active consideration. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered.

The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020. According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals. In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.

By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause" that same evening. Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 casesenough to trigger an investigation.

During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange. On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential". On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.

Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from China. Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020.

RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. A September 2020 review journal article said, "The possibility that the COVID‑19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.

, Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million.

Misinformation

After the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.

In September 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.

Other species

Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.

Some pets, especially cats and ferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans. Symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms. Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven. Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection. Behaviors which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.

The virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or chickens at all. Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.

Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus.

Minks, which are in the same family as ferrets, have been infected. Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans. Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms. Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations, following an outbreak referred to as Cluster 5. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.

Research

International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers. The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory. There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.

, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. , more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far.

Transmission and prevention research

Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the impact of interventions, or allocation of resources. Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology, estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic. Further, conceptual frameworks from crisis management research have been applied to better understand the effects of COVID‑19 on organizations worldwide.

Treatment-related research

Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta. More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.

Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. , France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‑19 treatment.

In June, initial results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.

In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID‑19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence). The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID‑19 patients.

In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least  who require supplemental oxygen therapy. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.

In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19. Bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least , and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19 or hospitalization. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.

In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least  who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19. The authorized use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.

Cytokine storm

A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.

Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is undergoing a PhaseII non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist was approved by the FDA to undergo a PhaseIII clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID‑19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS.

Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting Tcells in hospitalised patients with COVID‑19.

Passive antibodies

Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation. Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.

The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. An updated Cochrane review in May 2021 found high certainty evidence that, for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‑19, convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement. There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID‑19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.

Bioethics
Since the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis. Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies. The socio-economic inequalities between genders, races, groups with disabilities, communities, regions, countries, and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public.

Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade
There was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu.

=============== After Reranking ===============
 1 1.82390 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. Nomenclature During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The Director-General, Tedros Adhanom explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for 2019, the year in which the outbreak was first identified. The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications. Signs and symptoms Cause COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission Virology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 variants The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. At the present time, the expert group convened by WHO has recommended the labeling of variants using letters of the Greek Alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences." Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR). The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage. Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020. Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark. After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021. , there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December. Pathophysiology The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. Respiratory tract Following viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways. Nervous system One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Gastrointestinal tract The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Cardiovascular system The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease. Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function. A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in people transferred to Intensive care units (ICU) with COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Other organs Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. Immunopathology Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy. Viral and host factors Virus proteins Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which are heptad repeat regions. Studies have shown that S1 domain induced IgG and IgA antibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability,

As of late March, users of the social-media site Sina Weibo widely shared an undated photograph showing long lines at the Hankou funeral home in Wuhan. According to Caixin Global, the Hankou funeral home was operating 19 hours a day.

In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to

[2024-06-13 06:44:40,055] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications. Signs and symptoms Cause COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission Virology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Immunopathology Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors Virus proteins Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.

  early and late drug discovery. Early drug discovery focuses on genetic validation of a target, which is a strong predictor of success, but knock-out and overexpression systems are simplistic. Spatially and temporally conditional knock-out/knock-in systems have improved the level of nuance in in vivo analysis of protein function, but still fail to completely parallel the systemic breadth of pharmacological action. For example, drugs often act through multiple mechanisms, and often work best by engaging targets partially. Chemoproteomic tools offer a solution to bridge the gap between a genetic understanding of disease and a pharmacological understanding of drug action by identifying the many proteins involved in therapeutic success.

In accordance with the notion that the NMDA receptor is not responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine, dizocilpine (MK-801), which binds to and blocks the same site on the NMDA receptor that ketamine does, lacks antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, the findings would explain why other NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, lanicemine, and traxoprodil have thus far failed to demonstrate ketamine-like antidepressant effects in human clinical trials. Instead of acting via blockade of the NMDA receptor, (2R,6R)-HNK increases activation of the AMPA receptor via a currently unknown/uncertain mechanism. The compound is now

  Arketamine appears to be more effective as a rapid-acting antidepressant than esketamine in preclinical research. In rodent studies, esketamine produced hyperlocomotion, prepulse inhibition deficits, and rewarding effects, while arketamine did not, in accordance with its lower potency as an NMDA receptor antagonist and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. As such, arketamine may have a lower propensity for producing psychotomimetic effects and a lower abuse potential in addition to superior antidepressant efficacy. A study conducted in mice found that ketamine's antidepressant activity is not caused by ketamine inhibiting NMDAR, but rather by sustained activation of a different glutamate receptor, the AMPA receptor, by a metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine; as

 A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial.
In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks.
Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. In a subset of 154 patients, the improvement was greater in the higher-dose group (0.9 mg) than the lower-dose cohort (0.27 mg).
“These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News.
Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Each trial is to involve 700 patients.
Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics.
Although cognitive impairment occurs in nearly all (98%) patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotics do not adequately offer improvement.
With its unique mechanism seen as potentially helping to improve memory and cognitive function, encenicline is being studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia as well as Alzheimer’s disease.

 [Updated, 1:10 ET] Investors are going to have to wait awhile before they see Amicus Therapeutics submit its Fabry Disease drug to the FDA for approval. And they immediately showed their displeasure by sending the Cranbury, NJ-based company’s stock down more than 20 percent.
John Crowley, Amicus’ CEO, said on a conference call Monday that following discussions with the FDA, Amicus (NASDAQ: FOLD) has decided the data from its late-stage clinical trial of migalastat HCl isn’t enough to get the drug approved. Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA.
While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval.
Investors weren’t thrilled. Shares plunged 20 percent to $2.53 apiece as of 10:08 ET, from a $3.19 Friday close.
Those investors are understandably skeptical. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period.
But Amicus believes that once all of its studies run their course—the Fabry study will conclude after two years of total data—the skeptics will be proven wrong.
“We believe that the better regulatory strategy is to obtain all of the Phase 3 datasets and to combine and integrate these data into one NDA submission,” Crowley said on the call.
Fabry is a rare inherited disease that affects between 5,000 and 10,000 people worldwide. It’s caused by the deficiency of a specific enzyme that breaks down a fat known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3). Without the enzyme, GL-3 builds up in blood vessels, causing a host of side effects including severe kidney damage.
Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.
Amicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months.
At the end of the year, patients are given an option to continue therapy for an additional year (Crowley said 57 of those patients elected to do so).
In the second 60-patient study, 36 patients already undergoing enzyme-replacement therapy switched over to megalistat; the other 24 stayed on their existing therapy. Amicus is collecting data from that study over 18 months, and hopes to show that migalistat isn’t inferior to enzyme-replacement therapy, Crowley said on the call.
Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. Amicus said that difference wasn’t statistically significant.
Amicus proposed revisions to the study to the FDA based on reviewing the drug’s impact over 12 months, for example, but the agency indicated that wouldn’t help Amicus’ case for approval. Amicus hasn’t yet seen the 12-month data, Crowley said on the call.
The FDA said it would review the drug based on the “entirety” of the clinical data the two late-stage studies, and agreed to a follow-up meeting after the 12-month data is available and the second Phase 3 study is completed, he said.
[Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014.
“We really get no credit for that—quite frankly looking at today’s stock market today I don’t think we get credit for much beyond our cash,” Crowley says.
Amicus had about $85 million in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, and while Crowley says that is enough to get Amicus through the second half of 2014, the company has already been exploring potential partnerships to help bring in revenue without diluting its stock. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole.
“We’ll be open to lots of potential business development transactions in the quarters to come,” Crowley says.
For the Pompe drug, Amicus would look to do something “that would mirror” its partnership with GlaxoSmithKline: Amicus would keep U.S. rights, give up international rights, and the partner would take on the majority of the development costs. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley.
Crowley said on the call that the British pharma giant is still fully invested in its partnership with Amicus. GSK is Amicus’ largest shareholder and held 19.8 percent of its stock as of April 26, according to a proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Pomaglumetad (LY-404,039) is an amino acid analog drug that acts as a highly selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor group II subtypes mGluR2 and mGluR3. Pharmacological research has focused on its potential antipsychotic and anxiolytic effects. Pomaglumetad is intended as a treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic and anxiety disorders by modulating glutamatergic activity and reducing presynaptic release of glutamate at synapses in limbic and forebrain areas relevant to these disorders. Human studies investigating therapeutic use of pomaglumetad have focused on the prodrug LY-2140023, a methionine amide of pomaglumetad (also called pomaglumetad methionil) since pomaglumetad exhibits low oral absorption and bioavailability in humans.

Early human trials using this prodrug form of pomaglumetad gave encouraging results. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit.

In 2015, Denovo Biopharma exclusively licensed LY-2140023 (the prodrug) for further development, having identified "a meaningful subset of patients who showed significantly improved outcomes".

Pharmacology

Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics
Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Pomaglumetad is highly selective for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. pomaglumetad has been shown to act as a potent full agonist at group II mGluRs as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, formation as a result of stimulation by forskolin. Pomaglumetad has been shown to modulate glutamatergic activity in the limbic and forebrain areas, where group II mGlu receptors are most densely localized.

The specific binding of pomaglumetad to human cloned mGlu receptors has been found to be highest for mGluR2 (K = 149 ± 11 nM) and relatively high for mGluR3 (K = 92 ± 14 nM). Research suggests that it does not have any appreciable affinity for other metabotropic glutamate receptors, ionotropic NMDA receptors, or kainate receptors, nor does it appear to have any affinity for adrenergic, benzodiazepine/GABAergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors.
The functional activity of pomaglumetad on mGluR receptors has been further demonstrated by investigating the drug's ability to suppress electrically stimulated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs. Pomaglumetad has been shown to attenuate cortically evoked EPSPs in rat striatal spiny neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, mediated by activation of mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors. This suppressive effect of pomaglumetad on stimulated EPSPs is reversed by the use of mGluR2/3 antagonists, such as LY341495.

Pomaglumetad possesses partial agonist actions at D2 receptors and inhibits the binding of the D2-specific antagonist [3H]domperidone to human cloned D2 receptors. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Pomaglumetad also appears to have some effects on serotonin. It has been shown that pomaglumetad increases serotonin turnover, increasing the ratio of 5-HIAA to 5-HT, and suppresses serotonin-induced glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex.

There is disagreement in the literature as to the possible agonistic action that pomaglumetad has on dopamine receptors. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful.

Novelty
Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Pomaglumetad was one of the first drugs to be suggested as effective in treating psychosis without any apparent interference in dopaminergic function. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors.

Structurally, pomaglumetad is a close relative to other mGluR2/3 orthosteric agonists eglumetad, LY-379,268, LY-389,795, and MGS-008, all of which are members of the bicyclohexane family. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg.

Animal studies
The pharmacokinetic profile of pomaglumetad has been primarily investigated in rodent models. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. In overnight-fasted rats, intravenous dosing resulted in an AUC value of 2.9 ug*h/ml and a C value of 7.5 ug/ml. Oral administration resulted in an AUC value of 7.2 ug*h/ml and a C value of 4.0 ug/ml. The oral bioavailability in these rats was found to be 63%.

Pomaglumetad demonstrates similar efficacy to clozapine for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in amphetamine and PCP animal models. In both mice and rat studies, the drug demonstrates inhibition of induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned avoidance responding. Pomaglumetad has also been shown to attenuate fear-potentiated startle and reduce marble burying in rodents, predictive of anxiolytic efficacy. Use of pomaglumetad in rodent models indicates a lack of motor side effects or impairment, as determined by experiments using a rotarod. There also appear to be no sedative effects.

Animal studies and neurochemical models have also shown that use of pomaglumetad augments the efficacy of known antipsychotics, predictive of potential clinical efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone.

Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil 
Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. A single dose of 200 mg results in an AUC value of 900 ng*h/ml. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly.

Synthesis and pharmacology
LY-2140023 was identified using the analogous peptide prodrug approach used previously for talaglumetad, the prodrug of eglumetad. Synthesis was the result of preparation of LY-389795 followed by oxidation to pomaglumetad and coupling with L-methionine. LY-2140023 uses a human peptide transporter and hydrolytic pathways to deliver pomaglumetad to systemic circulation in humans. It is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to produce active pomaglumetad (~70% conversion), increasing its estimated bioavailability to 49%. In humans, use of LY-2140023 resulted in significantly higher plasma levels of pomaglumetad compared with oral administration of LY-404039. LY-2140023 appears to be an inactive prodrug, as K values for the drug have been found to be greater than 100 μM.

Treatment for schizophrenia
LY-2140023 is the first drug acting on mGlu receptors that has been studied in humans for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. It is suspected that LY-2140023 may balance and normalize dysregulated and hyperactive cortical pyramidal neurons in regions associated with schizophrenia and psychosis such as the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system. Clinical trials using LY-2140023 have investigated its use as a therapy when administered alone and as an adjuvant therapy used in addition to atypical antipsychotics.

Dosage and usage
The dosage of LY-2140023 given to patients has varied by clinical trial, though dosages have typically ranged between 10 mg and 40 mg twice daily (BID). In an early phase II monotherapy trial, the dosage shown to be efficacious was 40 mg BID. Later trials investigating the use of LY-2140023 as an adjuvant to the antipsychotic medications already used by patients participating in the study utilized a lower dose of 20 mg BID. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.

Efficacy and clinical trials
In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. The researchers on the clinical trial hypothesized that the lack of significant difference between LY-2140023 and olanzapine on their outcome measures was due to incorrect dosage of LY-2140023, and that the optimal therapeutic dose was yet to be determined.

A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued.

A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. Patients receiving LY-2140023 were compared to patients receiving other antipsychotic medications, including olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole, for a 24-week treatment phase and optional 28-week extension phase. Researchers found that over the initial 6–8 weeks of treatment, the improvement on the PANSS did not differ between groups. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group.

Tolerability and side effects
LY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. However, a second, multicenter study reported four patients experiencing convulsions, suggesting a potential for increased risk of seizures during treatment. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications.

Mild weight loss has also been associated with LY-2140023. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment.

Eli Lilly stops phase III development
In August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. The company completed a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group-assignment, dose-ranging, inpatient, multi-center clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive 5, 20, 40, or 80 mg of LY-2140023, placebo, or olanzapine for 28 days. Results of the clinical trial indicated that neither LY-2140023 nor olanzapine were significantly more efficacious than the placebo as determined with PANSS total scores. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness".

 Eli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials.
The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year.
An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement.
Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009.
The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts.
President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research.
The company said it would have to take a $25m-$30m charge in relation to the termination of the programme in its third-quarter results.
The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene).
Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab.
Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients.
Other drugs in Lilly's pipeline are now becoming even more crucial to the company, notably oncology candidate ramucirumab which is in phase III testing for metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular cancer.

 1 3.63444 A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial.
In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks.
Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. In a subset of 154 patients, the improvement was greater in the higher-dose group (0.9 mg) than the lower-dose cohort (0.27 mg).
“These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News.
Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Each trial is to involve 700 patients.
Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics.
Although cognitive impairment occurs in nearly all (98%) patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotics do not adequately offer improvement.
With its unique mechanism seen as potentially helping to improve memory and cognitive function, encenicline is being studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia as well as Alzheimer’s disease.
 2 3.06400 Pomaglumetad (LY-404,039) is an amino acid analog drug that acts as a highly selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor group II subtypes mGluR2 and mGluR3. Pharmacological research has focused on its potential antipsychotic and anxiolytic effects. Pomaglumetad is intended as a treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic and anxiety disorders by modulating glutamatergic activity and reducing presynaptic release of glutamate at synapses in limbic and forebrain areas relevant to these disorders. Human studies investigating therapeutic use of pomaglumetad have focused on the prodrug LY-2140023, a methionine amide of pomaglumetad (also called pomaglumetad methionil) since pomaglumetad exhibits low oral absorption and bioavailability in humans.

Early human trials using this prodrug form of pomaglumetad gave encouraging results. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit.

In 2015, Denovo Biopharma exclusively licensed LY-2140023 (the prodrug) for further development, having identified "a meaningful subset of patients who showed significantly improved outcomes".

Pharmacology

Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics
Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Pomaglumetad is highly selective for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. pomaglumetad has been shown to act as a potent full agonist at group II mGluRs as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, formation as a result of stimulation by forskolin. Pomaglumetad has been shown to modulate glutamatergic activity in the limbic and forebrain areas, where group II mGlu receptors are most densely localized.

The specific binding of pomaglumetad to human cloned mGlu receptors has been found to be highest for mGluR2 (K = 149 ± 11 nM) and relatively high for mGluR3 (K = 92 ± 14 nM). Research suggests that it does not have any appreciable affinity for other metabotropic glutamate receptors, ionotropic NMDA receptors, or kainate receptors, nor does it appear to have any affinity for adrenergic, benzodiazepine/GABAergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors.
The functional activity of pomaglumetad on mGluR receptors has been further demonstrated by investigating the drug's ability to suppress electrically stimulated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs. Pomaglumetad has been shown to attenuate cortically evoked EPSPs in rat striatal spiny neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, mediated by activation of mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors. This suppressive effect of pomaglumetad on stimulated EPSPs is reversed by the use of mGluR2/3 antagonists, such as LY341495.

Pomaglumetad possesses partial agonist actions at D2 receptors and inhibits the binding of the D2-specific antagonist [3H]domperidone to human cloned D2 receptors. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Pomaglumetad also appears to have some effects on serotonin. It has been shown that pomaglumetad increases serotonin turnover, increasing the ratio of 5-HIAA to 5-HT, and suppresses serotonin-induced glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex.

There is disagreement in the literature as to the possible agonistic action that pomaglumetad has on dopamine receptors. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful.

Novelty
Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Pomaglumetad was one of the first drugs to be suggested as effective in treating psychosis without any apparent interference in dopaminergic function. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors.

Structurally, pomaglumetad is a close relative to other mGluR2/3 orthosteric agonists eglumetad, LY-379,268, LY-389,795, and MGS-008, all of which are members of the bicyclohexane family. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg.

Animal studies
The pharmacokinetic profile of pomaglumetad has been primarily investigated in rodent models. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. In overnight-fasted rats, intravenous dosing resulted in an AUC value of 2.9 ug*h/ml and a C value of 7.5 ug/ml. Oral administration resulted in an AUC value of 7.2 ug*h/ml and a C value of 4.0 ug/ml. The oral bioavailability in these rats was found to be 63%.

Pomaglumetad demonstrates similar efficacy to clozapine for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in amphetamine and PCP animal models. In both mice and rat studies, the drug demonstrates inhibition of induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned avoidance responding. Pomaglumetad has also been shown to attenuate fear-potentiated startle and reduce marble burying in rodents, predictive of anxiolytic efficacy. Use of pomaglumetad in rodent models indicates a lack of motor side effects or impairment, as determined by experiments using a rotarod. There also appear to be no sedative effects.

Animal studies and neurochemical models have also shown that use of pomaglumetad augments the efficacy of known antipsychotics, predictive of potential clinical efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone.

Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil 
Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. A single dose of 200 mg results in an AUC value of 900 ng*h/ml. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly.

Synthesis and pharmacology
LY-2140023 was identified using the analogous peptide prodrug approach used previously for talaglumetad, the prodrug of eglumetad. Synthesis was the result of preparation of LY-389795 followed by oxidation to pomaglumetad and coupling with L-methionine. LY-2140023 uses a human peptide transporter and hydrolytic pathways to deliver pomaglumetad to systemic circulation in humans. It is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to produce active pomaglumetad (~70% conversion), increasing its estimated bioavailability to 49%. In humans, use of LY-2140023 resulted in significantly higher plasma levels of pomaglumetad compared with oral administration of LY-404039. LY-2140023 appears to be an inactive prodrug, as K values for the drug have been found to be greater than 100 μM.

Treatment for schizophrenia
LY-2140023 is the first drug acting on mGlu receptors that has been studied in humans for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. It is suspected that LY-2140023 may balance and normalize dysregulated and hyperactive cortical pyramidal neurons in regions associated with schizophrenia and psychosis such as the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system. Clinical trials using LY-2140023 have investigated its use as a therapy when administered alone and as an adjuvant therapy used in addition to atypical antipsychotics.

Dosage and usage
The dosage of LY-2140023 given to patients has varied by clinical trial, though dosages have typically ranged between 10 mg and 40 mg twice daily (BID). In an early phase II monotherapy trial, the dosage shown to be efficacious was 40 mg BID. Later trials investigating the use of LY-2140023 as an adjuvant to the antipsychotic medications already used by patients participating in the study utilized a lower dose of 20 mg BID. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.

Efficacy and clinical trials
In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. The researchers on the clinical trial hypothesized that the lack of significant difference between LY-2140023 and olanzapine on their outcome measures was due to incorrect dosage of LY-2140023, and that the optimal therapeutic dose was yet to be determined.

A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued.

A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. Patients receiving LY-2140023 were compared to patients receiving other antipsychotic medications, including olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole, for a 24-week treatment phase and optional 28-week extension phase. Researchers found that over the initial 6–8 weeks of treatment, the improvement on the PANSS did not differ between groups. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group.

Tolerability and side effects
LY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. However, a second, multicenter study reported four patients experiencing convulsions, suggesting a potential for increased risk of seizures during treatment. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications.

Mild weight loss has also been associated with LY-2140023. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment.

Eli Lilly stops phase III development
In August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. The company completed a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group-assignment, dose-ranging, inpatient, multi-center clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive 5, 20, 40, or 80 mg of LY-2140023, placebo, or olanzapine for 28 days. Results of the clinical trial indicated that neither LY-2140023 nor olanzapine were significantly more efficacious than the placebo as determined with PANSS total scores. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness".

 4 -0.73775 [Updated, 1:10 ET] Investors are going to have to wait awhile before they see Amicus Therapeutics submit its Fabry Disease drug to the FDA for approval. And they immediately showed their displeasure by sending the Cranbury, NJ-based company’s stock down more than 20 percent.
John Crowley, Amicus’ CEO, said on a conference call Monday that following discussions with the FDA, Amicus (NASDAQ: FOLD) has decided the data from its late-stage clinical trial of migalastat HCl isn’t enough to get the drug approved. Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA.
While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval.
Investors weren’t thrilled. Shares plunged 20 percent to $2.53 apiece as of 10:08 ET, from a $3.19 Friday close.
Those investors are understandably skeptical. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period.
But Amicus believes that once all of its studies run their course—the Fabry study will conclude after two years of total data—the skeptics will be proven wrong.
“We believe that the better regulatory strategy is to obtain all of the Phase 3 datasets and to combine and integrate these data into one NDA submission,” Crowley said on the call.
Fabry is a rare inherited disease that affects between 5,000 and 10,000 people worldwide. It’s caused by the deficiency of a specific enzyme that breaks down a fat known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3). Without the enzyme, GL-3 builds up in blood vessels, causing a host of side effects including severe kidney damage.
Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.
Amicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months.
At the end of the year, patients are given an option to continue therapy for an additional year (Crowley said 57 of those patients elected to do so).
In the second 60-patient study, 36 patients already undergoing enzyme-replacement therapy switched over to megalistat; the other 24 stayed on their existing therapy. Amicus is collecting data from that study over 18 months, and hopes to show that migalistat isn’t inferior to enzyme-replacement therapy, Crowley said on the call.
Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. Amicus said that difference wasn’t statistically significant.
Amicus proposed revisions to the study to the FDA based on reviewing the drug’s impact over 12 months, for example, but the agency indicated that wouldn’t help Amicus’ case for approval. Amicus hasn’t yet seen the 12-month data, Crowley said on the call.
The FDA said it would review the drug based on the “entirety” of the clinical data the two late-stage studies, and agreed to a follow-up meeting after the 12-month data is available and the second Phase 3 study is completed, he said.
[Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014.
“We really get no credit for that—quite frankly looking at today’s stock market today I don’t think we get credit for much beyond our cash,” Crowley says.
Amicus had about $85 million in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, and while Crowley says that is enough to get Amicus through the second half of 2014, the company has already been exploring potential partnerships to help bring in revenue without diluting its stock. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole.
“We’ll be open to lots of potential business development transactions in the quarters to come,” Crowley says.
For the Pompe drug, Amicus would look to do something “that would mirror” its partnership with GlaxoSmithKline: Amicus would keep U.S. rights, give up international rights, and the partner would take on the majority of the development costs. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley.
Crowley said on the call that the British pharma giant is still fully invested in its partnership with Amicus. GSK is Amicus’ largest shareholder and held 19.8 percent of its stock as of April 26, according to a proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 5 -3.12710 Eli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials.
The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year.
An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement.
Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009.
The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts.
President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research.
The company said it would have to take a $25m-$30m charge in relation to the termination of the programme in its third-quarter results.
The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene).
Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab.
Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients.
Other drugs in Lilly's pipeline are now becoming even more crucial to the company, notably oncology candidate ramucirumab which is in phase III testing for metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular cancer.

[2024-06-13 06:45:05,305] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial. In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty
Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil 
Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.

Efficacy and clinical trials
In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects
LY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development
In August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness".

[Updated, 1:10 ET] Investors are going to have to wait awhile before they see Amicus Therapeutics submit its Fabry Disease drug to the FDA for approval. Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.
Amicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did.

Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil 
Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.

Efficacy and clinical trials
In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects
LY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development
In August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness".

  Deutsche Welle describes ITN as a party that could "turn anti-vax into state policy", stating that the party's parliamentary head, Toshko Yordanov, had supported and spread anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in parliament by claiming that vaccines do not reduce COVID-19 transmission. Trifonov rejected the accusation, stating that he would "not flirt with anti-vaxxers ... as that would be like flirting with death", adding that he himself is vaccinated against COVID-19. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented "discrimination" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as "tyranny" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests.

 Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, M.D.
Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to update you on the public health challenges of 2009 H1N1 influenza.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and our colleagues throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are working in close partnership with many parts of the federal government, as well as with states and localities, under a national preparedness and response framework for action that builds on the efforts and lessons learned from the past few months, this previous spring and influenza preparedness trainings conducted during the last several years. Working together with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, state and local health departments, the medical community and our private sector partners, we have been monitoring the spread of H1N1 and facilitating prevention and treatment, including implementing a vaccination program. CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign.
pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges.
One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Since the initial spring emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza, the virus has spread throughout the world. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. This virus also remains susceptible to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir, with very rare exception.
Unlike a usual influenza season, flu activity in the United States continued throughout the summer, at summer camps and elsewhere. More recently, we have seen widespread influenza activity in 48 states; any reports of widespread influenza this early in the season are very unusual. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. We are also already observing that more communities are affected than those that experienced H1N1 outbreaks this past spring and summer.
Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization.
Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. CDC continues to support all states and territories with test reagents, equipment, and funding to maintain laboratory staff and ship specimens for testing. In addition, CDC serves as the primary support for public health laboratories conducting H1N1 tests around the globe and has provided test reagents to 406 laboratories in 154 countries. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain.
Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. HHS is in constant communication with state health officials and hospital administrators to monitor stress on the health care system and to prepare for the possibility that federal medical assets will be necessary to supplement state and local surge capabilities. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants.
Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. This monitoring system generates a verified, near-real-time, national summary report daily on the number of school dismissals by state across the 130,000 public and private schools in the United States, and the number of students and teachers impacted. The system was activated August 3, 2009. This has helped us to calibrate our messages and guidance and may have contributed to the smaller number of school closings seen in the fall relative to those seen in the spring.
A second major area of effort in support of individuals and institutions is to provide science-based guidance that allows them to take appropriate and effective action. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. We can all take action to reduce the impact flu will have on our communities, schools, businesses, other community organizations, and homes this fall, winter, and spring.
There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC also has provided guidance to workers and in relation to work settings, such as health care workers, first responders, and those in the swine industry, as well as to laboratories, homeless shelters, correctional and detention centers, hemodialysis centers, schools, child care settings, colleges and universities, small businesses, and federal agencies.
With the holidays coming up, reducing the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza among travelers will be an important consideration.
CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Interim guidance documents for response to travelers with influenza-like illness, for airline crew, cruise ship personnel and Department of Homeland Security port and field staff have been developed and posted online. As new information about this 2009 H1N1 influenza virus becomes available, CDC will evaluate its guidance and, as appropriate, update it using the best available science and ensure that these changes are communicated to the public, partners, and other stakeholders.
In preparation for the upcoming months when we expect many families and individuals to gather for the holidays, we are preparing to launch a national communications campaign to encourage domestic and international travelers to take steps to prevent the spread of flu. Plans are to display public advertisements with flu prevention messages in ports of entry and various other advertising locations, such as newspapers and online advertisements, both before and during the upcoming holiday travel season.
A third major area of effort is to support shared responsibility and action through enhanced communication to individuals. Our recommendations and action plans are based on the best available scientific information. CDC is working to ensure that Americans are informed about this pandemic and consistently updated with information in clear language. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic is a dynamic situation, and it is essential that the American people are fully engaged and able to be part of the mitigation strategy and overall response. CDC will continue to conduct regular media briefings, available at flu.gov, to get critical information about influenza to the American people.
Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Covering your cough and sneeze and washing your hands frequently will also help reduce the spread of infection. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses.
CDC is communicating with the public about ways to reduce the spread of flu in more interactive formats such as blog posts on the Focus on Flu WebMD blog, radio public service announcements, and podcasts.
Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. Our information is updated around the clock so we are well positioned to respond to the needs and concerns of our inquirers. Our customer service representatives get first-hand feedback from the public on a daily basis. In addition to the H1N1 response, we continue to provide this service for all other CDC programs.
A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. Working in close partnership with industry, HHS has led the process of developing a safe and effective 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, but the delivery of vaccine to the public has not been as rapid as hoped or initially estimated. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. The speed of this vaccine development was made possible due to investments made in vaccine advanced research and development and vaccine manufacturing infrastructure building through the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) over the past four years, and in collaboration with CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and FDA. The rapid responses of HHS agencies, in terms of surveillance, viral characterization, pre-clinical and clinical testing, and assay development, were greatly aided by pandemic preparedness efforts for influenza pandemics set in motion by the H5N1 virus re-emergence in 2003, and the resources Congress provided for those efforts.
Pandemic planning had anticipated vaccine becoming available 6-9 months after emergence of a new influenza. In fact, 2009 H1N1 vaccination began in early October—just 5 months after the emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza. Critical support from Congress resulted in $1.44 billion for states and hospitals to support planning, preparation, and implementation efforts. States and cities began placing orders for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine on September 30th. The first vaccination with 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine outside of clinical trials was given October 5th. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Although the initial pace of vaccine delivery to the States has complicated the early immunization efforts, vaccine will become increasingly available over the weeks ahead, and will become more visible through delivery in a variety of settings, such as vaccination clinics organized by local health departments, healthcare provider offices, schools, pharmacies, and workplaces.
States have begun executing their plans to provide vaccine to targeted priority populations, and CDC continues to offer technical assistance to states and other public health partners as we work together to ensure the H1N1 vaccination program is as effective as possible. Although we had hoped to have more vaccine distributed by this point, we are working hard to get vaccine out to the public just as soon as we receive it.
H1N1 vaccines are manufactured by the same companies employing the same methods used for the yearly production of seasonal flu vaccines. H1N1 vaccine is distributed to providers and state health departments similarly to the way federally purchased vaccines are distributed in the Vaccines for Children program. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus.
CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. On July 29, 2009, ACIP recommended targeting the first available doses of H1N1 vaccine to five high-risk groups comprised of approximately 159 million people; CDC accepted these recommendations. These groups are: pregnant women; people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age; health care and emergency services personnel; persons between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; and people from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for severe disease because of chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes, or compromised immune systems. In addition, ACIP recommended that local public health authorities may want to prioritize a smaller group of people while supplies are limited, in which case the following groups who are at the highest risk for infection or severe illness should receive the vaccine before others: pregnant women, people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency medical services personnel with direct patient contact, children 6 months through 4 years of age, and children 5 through 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions. This subset of the five target groups comprises approximately 42 million persons in the United States. These recommendations provide a framework from which states can tailor vaccination to local needs.
Ensuring a vaccine that is safe as well as effective is a top priority. CDC expects that the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine will have a similar safety profile to seasonal influenza vaccine, which historically has an excellent safety track record. So far the reports of adverse events among H1N1 vaccination are generally mild and are similar to those we see with seasonal flu vaccine. We will remain alert, however, for the possibility of rare, severe adverse events that could be linked to vaccination. CDC and FDA have been working to enhance surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events among vaccinated persons and to adjust the vaccination program to minimize these risks. Two primary systems used to monitor vaccine safety are the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), jointly operated between CDC and FDA, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project, a collaborative project with eight managed care organizations covering more than nine million members. These systems are designed to determine whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate than among unvaccinated persons. CDC has worked with FDA and other partners to strengthen these vaccine safety tracking systems and we continue to develop new ways to monitor vaccine safety, as announced earlier this week by the Federal Immunization Safety Task Force in HHS. In addition, based on the recommendation of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), HHS established the H1N1 Vaccine Safety Risk Assessment Working Group to review 2009 H1N1 vaccine safety data as it accumulates. This working group of outside experts will conduct regular, rapid reviews of available data from the federal safety monitoring systems and present them to NVAC and federal leadership for appropriate policy action and follow-up.
More than 36,000 people die each year from complications associated with seasonal flu. CDC continues to recommend vaccination against seasonal influenza viruses, especially for all people 50 years of age and over and all adults with certain chronic medical conditions, as well as infants and children. As of the fourth week in October, 89 million doses of seasonal vaccine had been distributed. It appears that interest in seasonal flu vaccine has been unprecedented this year. Manufacturers estimate that a total of 114 million doses will be brought to the U.S. market.
In the spring, anticipating commercial market constraints, HHS deployed 11 million courses of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ensure the nation was positioned to quickly employ these drugs to combat 2009 H1N1 and its spread. In early October, HHS shipped an additional 300,000 bottles of the oral suspension formulation of the antiviral oseltamivir to states in order to mitigate a predicted near-term national shortage indicated by commercial supply data. In addition, the Secretary authorized the release of the remaining 234,000 bottles of pediatric Tamiflu® on October 29th. We will continue to conduct outreach to pharmacists and providers related to pediatric dosing and compounding practices to help assure supplies are able to meet pediatric demand for antiviral treatment, and we have updated our guidance relating to general antiviral use as new information has warranted. Finally, CDC and FDA have also worked together to address potential options for treatment of seriously ill hospitalized patients with influenza, including situations in which physicians may wish to use investigational formulations of antiviral drugs for intravenous therapy. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) on October 23rd, 2009, for the investigational antiviral drug peramivir intravenous (IV) authorizing the emergency use of peramivir for the treatment of certain hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. Physician requests for peramivir to be used under the EUA are managed through a CDC web portal.
CDC is working hard to limit the impact of this pandemic, and we are committed to keeping the public and the Congress fully informed about both the situation and our response. We are collaborating with our federal partners as well as with other organizations that have unique expertise to help CDC provide guidance to multiple sectors of our economy and society. There have been enormous efforts in the United States and abroad to prepare for this kind of challenge.
Our nation’s current preparedness is a direct result of the investments and support of Congress over recent years, effective planning and action by Federal agencies, and the hard work of state and local officials across the country. We look forward to working closely with Congress as we address the situation as it continues to evolve in the weeks and months ahead.
Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this conversation with you and your colleagues. I look forward to answering your questions.

 The TeamHeath Medical Call Center (THMCC) is one of the country’s most established, reputable and sought after providers of telephone nurse triage clinical care. Esteemed clients include academic medical centers, large multi-specialty practices, FQHCs, health plans and university student health services.
For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general.
As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion.
• Last year’s outbreak was the worst in a decade. The CDC ranked it as a high severity season that started in November of 2017 and extended through March 2018. There were 30,453 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in the United States.
• The flu is devastating to the old and young. People 65 years and older accounted for approximately 58% of reported influenza-associated hospitalizations. As of August 25, 2018, a total of 180 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC during the 2017-2018 season. Approximately 80% of these deaths occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination prior to or during that season.
• Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important step in protecting against influenza and its potentially serious complications. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. People at high risk of serious flu complications include young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older.
• People who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue (tiredness). Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.
• Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? The HHS website states that flu and other vaccines are required to be covered by your health insurance without charging a co-payment or coinsurance, but be sure to check with your insurance company to find out if you must go to a specific facility to receive the vaccine. Some insurance plans only cover vaccines given by your doctor or at specific locations.
Experience is the best teacher. THMCC has more than 22 years of experience gained from caring for millions of patients. Preparation and compliance with the CDC recommendations will result in the best possible health outcomes we will all face during the upcoming 2018-19 FLU SEASON.

  Since 2009, health insurance has been compulsory for the whole population in Germany, when coverage was expanded from the majority of the population to everyone. As of 2021, salaried workers and employees who make less than €64,350 per year or €5,362.50 per month are automatically enrolled into one of currently around 105 public non-profit "sickness funds" (Krankenkassen). The fund has a common rate for all members, and is paid for with joint employer-employee contributions. The employer pays half of the contribution, and the employee pays the other half. Self-employed workers and those who are unemployed without benefits must pay the entire contribution themselves. Provider payment is negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified self-governed bodies

 1 1.86478 Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, M.D. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to update you on the public health challenges of 2009 H1N1 influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and our colleagues throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are working in close partnership with many parts of the federal government, as well as with states and localities, under a national preparedness and response framework for action that builds on the efforts and lessons learned from the past few months, this previous spring and influenza preparedness trainings conducted during the last several years. Working together with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, state and local health departments, the medical community and our private sector partners, we have been monitoring the spread of H1N1 and facilitating prevention and treatment, including implementing a vaccination program. CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Since the initial spring emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza, the virus has spread throughout the world. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. This virus also remains susceptible to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir, with very rare exception. Unlike a usual influenza season, flu activity in the United States continued throughout the summer, at summer camps and elsewhere. More recently, we have seen widespread influenza activity in 48 states; any reports of widespread influenza this early in the season are very unusual. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. We are also already observing that more communities are affected than those that experienced H1N1 outbreaks this past spring and summer. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. CDC continues to support all states and territories with test reagents, equipment, and funding to maintain laboratory staff and ship specimens for testing. In addition, CDC serves as the primary support for public health laboratories conducting H1N1 tests around the globe and has provided test reagents to 406 laboratories in 154 countries. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. HHS is in constant communication with state health officials and hospital administrators to monitor stress on the health care system and to prepare for the possibility that federal medical assets will be necessary to supplement state and local surge capabilities. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. This monitoring system generates a verified, near-real-time, national summary report daily on the number of school dismissals by state across the 130,000 public and private schools in the United States, and the number of students and teachers impacted. The system was activated August 3, 2009. This has helped us to calibrate our messages and guidance and may have contributed to the smaller number of school closings seen in the fall relative to those seen in the spring. A second major area of effort in support of individuals and institutions is to provide science-based guidance that allows them to take appropriate and effective action. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. We can all take action to reduce the impact flu will have on our communities, schools, businesses, other community organizations, and homes this fall, winter, and spring. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC also has provided guidance to workers and in relation to work settings, such as health care workers, first responders, and those in the swine industry, as well as to laboratories, homeless shelters, correctional and detention centers, hemodialysis centers, schools, child care settings, colleges and universities, small businesses, and federal agencies. With the holidays coming up, reducing the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza among travelers will be an important consideration. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Interim guidance documents for response to travelers with influenza-like illness, for airline crew, cruise ship personnel and Department of Homeland Security port and field staff have been developed and posted online. As new information about this 2009 H1N1 influenza virus becomes available, CDC will evaluate its guidance and, as appropriate, update it using the best available science and ensure that these changes are communicated to the public, partners, and other stakeholders. In preparation for the upcoming months when we expect many families and individuals to gather for the holidays, we are preparing to launch a national communications campaign to encourage domestic and international travelers to take steps to prevent the spread of flu. Plans are to display public advertisements with flu prevention messages in ports of entry and various other advertising locations, such as newspapers and online advertisements, both before and during the upcoming holiday travel season. A third major area of effort is to support shared responsibility and action through enhanced communication to individuals. Our recommendations and action plans are based on the best available scientific information. CDC is working to ensure that Americans are informed about this pandemic and consistently updated with information in clear language. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic is a dynamic situation, and it is essential that the American people are fully engaged and able to be part of the mitigation strategy and overall response. CDC will continue to conduct regular media briefings, available at flu.gov, to get critical information about influenza to the American people. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Covering your cough and sneeze and washing your hands frequently will also help reduce the spread of infection. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. CDC is communicating with the public about ways to reduce the spread of flu in more interactive formats such as blog posts on the Focus on Flu WebMD blog, radio public service announcements, and podcasts. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. Our information is updated around the clock so we are well positioned to respond to the needs and concerns of our inquirers. Our customer service representatives get first-hand feedback from the public on a daily basis. In addition to the H1N1 response, we continue to provide this service for all other CDC programs. A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. Working in close partnership with industry, HHS has led the process of developing a safe and effective 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, but the delivery of vaccine to the public has not been as rapid as hoped or initially estimated. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. The speed of this vaccine development was made possible due to investments made in vaccine advanced research and development and vaccine manufacturing infrastructure building through the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) over the past four years, and in collaboration with CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and FDA. The rapid responses of HHS agencies, in terms of surveillance, viral characterization, pre-clinical and clinical testing, and assay development, were greatly aided by pandemic preparedness efforts for influenza pandemics set in motion by the H5N1 virus re-emergence in 2003, and the resources Congress provided for those efforts. Pandemic planning had anticipated vaccine becoming available 6-9 months after emergence of a new influenza. In fact, 2009 H1N1 vaccination began in early October—just 5 months after the emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza. Critical support from Congress resulted in $1.44 billion for states and hospitals to support planning, preparation, and implementation efforts. States and cities began placing orders for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine on September 30th. The first vaccination with 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine outside of clinical trials was given October 5th. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Although the initial pace of vaccine delivery to the States has complicated the early immunization efforts, vaccine will become increasingly available over the weeks ahead, and will become more visible through delivery in a variety of settings, such as vaccination clinics organized by local health departments, healthcare provider offices, schools, pharmacies, and workplaces. States have begun executing their plans to provide vaccine to targeted priority populations, and CDC continues to offer technical assistance to states and other public health partners as we work together to ensure the H1N1 vaccination program is as effective as possible. Although we had hoped to have more vaccine distributed by this point, we are working hard to get vaccine out to the public just as soon as we receive it. H1N1 vaccines are manufactured by the same companies employing the same methods used for the yearly production of seasonal flu vaccines. H1N1 vaccine is distributed to providers and state health departments similarly to the way federally purchased vaccines are distributed in the Vaccines for Children program. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. On July 29, 2009, ACIP
 2 -2.12355 The TeamHeath Medical Call Center (THMCC) is one of the country’s most established, reputable and sought after providers of telephone nurse triage clinical care. Esteemed clients include academic medical centers, large multi-specialty practices, FQHCs, health plans and university student health services.
For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general.
As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion.
• Last year’s outbreak was the worst in a decade. The CDC ranked it as a high severity season that started in November of 2017 and extended through March 2018. There were 30,453 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in the United States.
• The flu is devastating to the old and young. People 65 years and older accounted for approximately 58% of reported influenza-associated hospitalizations. As of August 25, 2018, a total of 180 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC during the 2017-2018 season. Approximately 80% of these deaths occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination prior to or during that season.
• Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important step in protecting against influenza and its potentially serious complications. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. People at high risk of serious flu complications include young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older.
• People who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue (tiredness). Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.
• Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? The HHS website states that flu and other vaccines are required to be covered by your health insurance without charging a co-payment or coinsurance, but be sure to check with your insurance company to find out if you must go to a specific facility to receive the vaccine.

Trifonov rejected the accusation, stating that he would "not flirt with anti-vaxxers ... as that would be like flirting with death", adding that he himself is vaccinated against COVID-19. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented "discrimination" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks.

ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as "tyranny" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests. For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general. As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion. • The flu is devastating to the old and young. • Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. • Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? THMCC has more than 22 years of experience gained from caring for millions of patients.

Transduction of the missing gene to hematopoietic stem cells using viral vectors is being tested in ADA SCID and X-linked SCID. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva's blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them. These cells were then injected back into her body, and began to express a normal enzyme. This, augmented by weekly injections of ADA, corrected her deficiency. However, the concurrent

 LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first life-saving gene therapy for children, developed by Italian scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, has been recommended for approval in Europe, boosting the pioneering technology to fix faulty genes.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available.
Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. They rarely survive beyond two years unless their immune function is restored with a suitable bone marrow transplant.
SCID is sometimes known as “bubble baby” disease, since children born with it have immune systems so weak they must live in germ-free environments.
Strimvelis is expected to secure formal marketing authorization from the European Commission in a couple of months, making it the second gene therapy to be approved in Europe, after UniQure’s Glybera, which treats a rare adult blood disorder.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development.
Other large pharmaceutical companies are also eyeing the field, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has a tie-up with UniQure.
Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells.
Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development.
“We’re on page one of chapter one of a new medicine text book,” he told Reuters.
A host of challenges still need to be overcome, including the complexity of delivering a product like GSK’s new treatment, which requires bone marrow cells to be taken from the patient, processed and injected back.
Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. UniQure’s Glybera made history in 2014 as the first drug to carry a $1 million price tag. GSK is not putting a price on its product but a source close to the company said that, if approved, Strimvelis would cost “very significantly less than $1 million”.
GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years.
Its Strimvelis treatment for ADA-SCID is also being lined up for submission to U.S. regulators, although Andrews said this would not happen before the end of next year.

  GenePeeks simulates the combination of genetic sequences of two people and predicts potential diseases and inherited disorders to find good recipient matches for sperm donors. By simulating the process of reproduction with the two DNA sequences, the company's software (called Matchright) forms a hypothetical child genome to determine the likelihood of the resulting child developing one of around 600 conditions. The technology is currently aimed at sperm banks; the first users will be at two fertility clinics in the United States, one of which is Manhattan Cryobank in New York City. The software creates around 10,000 virtual genomes for each donor-recipient pair, and typically rules out 10-15% of donors as bad matches for the recipient. Currently it only searches for single gene genetic conditions, but the company plan to expand the software to look for multiple gene diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Concern has been raised as to whether the software would allow "designer babies", but the company say that they are not intending to use the system for non-medical purposes.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available.
Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. They rarely survive beyond two years unless their immune function is restored with a suitable bone marrow transplant.
SCID is sometimes known as “bubble baby” disease, since children born with it have immune systems so weak they must live in germ-free environments.
Strimvelis is expected to secure formal marketing authorization from the European Commission in a couple of months, making it the second gene therapy to be approved in Europe, after UniQure’s Glybera, which treats a rare adult blood disorder.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development.
Other large pharmaceutical companies are also eyeing the field, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has a tie-up with UniQure.
Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells.
Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development.
“We’re on page one of chapter one of a new medicine text book,” he told Reuters.
A host of challenges still need to be overcome, including the complexity of delivering a product like GSK’s new treatment, which requires bone marrow cells to be taken from the patient, processed and injected back.
Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. UniQure’s Glybera made history in 2014 as the first drug to carry a $1 million price tag. GSK is not putting a price on its product but a source close to the company said that, if approved, Strimvelis would cost “very significantly less than $1 million”.
GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years.
Its Strimvelis treatment for ADA-SCID is also being lined up for submission to U.S. regulators, although Andrews said this would not happen before the end of next year.

  e-cigarette appeal and usage. As such, adolescents were more likely to initiate vaping through flavored e-cigarettes than unflavored ones, and a majority of youth who used an e-cigarette first tried a flavored e-cigarette. The goal of tobacco companies also drives the widespread use of flavored tobacco products. According to a 2008 study, the internal tobacco company documents found that makers of the largest menthol cigarette brands in the United States—Kool, Newport, Salem, Marlboro, and Camel—formulated the menthol levels in their cigarettes, as well as their marketing strategies, to entice young people. Likewise, multiple reviews of internal tobacco company documents have found that flavored cigarettes are deliberately introduced to appeal

  young people, with flavorings often being fine-tuned to best appeal to youth. Furthermore, flavored tobacco products are often advertised to children and adolescents. Flavored cigarettes have been advertised in magazines frequently read by kids, such as Sports Illustrated, Cosmopolitan, and Rolling Stone and on television programs watched by adolescents. A majority of adolescents and young adults are exposed to cigarillo advertising in magazines and storefronts and on social media. Flavored e-cigarettes have been marketed extensively to youth in retail stores and on television and social media: 78.2 percent of American youth (20.5 million people).

  Flavored tobacco products—particularly flavored cigarettes (including menthol), cigarillos, hookah,  and electronic cigarettes  —are disproportionately preferred by adolescents and young adults. Because of the high availability of these popular flavors, flavored tobacco products are widely used for at least 80% of youth tobacco users. According to the CDC, 67% of high school students and 49% of middle school students who used tobacco products in the past 30 days reported using a flavored tobacco product during that time. Flavored tobacco products promote youth smoking initiation and help young occasional smokers to become daily smokers by reducing or masking the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke and increasing the social acceptability

  on the pharynx. The long-term toxicity is subject to the additives and contaminants in the e-liquid. Certain e-liquid flavorings contain diacetyl and acetyl propionyl which give a buttery taste. Diacetyl and acetyl propionyl are associated with bronchiolitis obliterans ("popcorn lung"), a serious lung disease. A 2015 review recommended for specific regulation of diacetyl and acetyl propionyl in e-liquid, which are safe when ingested but have been associated with respiratory harm when inhaled. Both diacetyl and acetyl-propionyl have been found in concentrations above those recommended by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Diacetyl is normally found at lower

  the toxic tobacco product. Menthol appeals to younger or beginning smokers largely because the menthol masks the harshness and discomfort of inhaling smoke, making smoking more palatable. Trying menthols increases smoking initiation among youth and young adults, and menthols users face greater addiction and decreased success in quitting smoking. Young people who use menthol cigarettes are 80% more likely to become life-long smokers than those who use regular cigarettes. Likewise, studies associate youth hookah use with subsequent cigarette use, increased intensity of cigarette use, and decreased success in quitting.

 Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses, such as pneumonia, but sufferers typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Differential diagnoses have overlapping features with VAPI, including COVID-19.

Sufferers usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths.

All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. CDC data show that the outbreak peaked in September 2019, and declined steadily to a low level through January 2020. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was "driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources." However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes.

The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020.

Signs and symptoms
Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy.  In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms. Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever. Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing. Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease. In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation. Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks.

Possible causes
No single cause of these illnesses has been established . Many different substances and product sources continued to be under investigation.

Possible sources of VAPI include:
 E-liquid vaporizers
 Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. Metal coils coated with microporous ceramic have been developed to protect against oxidation of metals.
 Vape blend chemicals:
 E-liquid carrying agents:
 Glycerin (vegetable glycerin (VG)) and/or propylene glycol (PG): Glycerin was long thought to be a safe option. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. Glycerin may also cause lipid pneumonia.
 MCT oil: In vivo mouse exposure of inhaled MCT oil induces acute inflammation.
 Vitamin E acetate: On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. The CDC stated as of 11 February 2020 that previous research suggested inhaled vitamin E acetate may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaped vitamin E acetate produced exceptionally toxic ketene gas, along with carcinogenic alkenes and benzene.
 Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity.
 Psychoactive substances:
 Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Synthetic cannabinoids are increasingly offered in e-cigarette form as "c-liquid".
 Viruses
 SARS-CoV-2: Shared vaping devices are linked to COVID-19.
 Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through "dabbing." Dabbing uses a different type of device to heat and extract cannabinoids for inhalation. It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials.

Mechanism 

Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. glycerin (sold as vegetable glycerine (VG)), propylene glycol (PG)). The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown.

Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products.

VAPI appears to be a type of acute lung injury, similar to acute fibrinous pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology causing VAPI.

Diagnosis 
High clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of VAPI. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. Healthcare providers were advised to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.

All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. Additionally a detailed physical examination was recommended, specifically including vital signs and pulse-oximetry. Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which might include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, complete blood count with differential, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), liver transaminases, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC were recommended. Imaging, typically a chest X-ray, with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results did not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease were urged. It was pointed out that consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) could help guide further evaluation. The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis. Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission,  following the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis but are performed as clinically indicated to rule out the likelihood of infection.

There are non-specific laboratory abnormalities that have been reported in association with the disease, including elevations in white blood cell count (with neutrophilic predominance and absence of eosinophilia), transaminases, procalcitonin, and inflammatory markers. Infectious disease testing, including blood and sputum cultures and tests for influenza, Mycoplasma, and Legionella were all found to be negative in the majority of reported cases. Imaging abnormalities are typically bilateral and are usually described as "pulmonary infiltrates or opacities" on chest X-ray and "ground-glass opacities" on chest CT. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may exhibit an increased level of neutrophils in combination with lymphocytes and vacuole-laden macrophages. Lavage cytology with oil red O staining demonstrated extensive lipid-laden alveolar macrophages. In the few cases in which lung biopsies were performed, the results were consistent with acute lung injury and included a broad range of features, such as acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, lipid-laden macrophages, and organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsies often showed neutrophil predominance as well, with rare eosinophils.

Case definitions 
Based on the clinical characteristics of VAPI cases from ongoing federal and state investigations, interim surveillance case definitions for confirmed and probable cases have been developed.

The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:
 Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND
 Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND
 Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. Minimum criteria include:
 A negative respiratory viral panel
 A negative influenza polymerase chain reaction or rapid test if local epidemiology supports testing.
 All other clinically indicated respiratory infectious disease testing (e.g., urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, sputum culture if productive cough, bronchoalveolar lavage culture if done, blood culture, human immunodeficiency virus–related opportunistic respiratory infections if appropriate) must be negative and
 No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process).

The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:

These surveillance case definitions are meant for public health data collection purposes and are not intended to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to guide clinical care; they are subject to change and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Differential diagnosis 
As VAPI was, as of October 2019, a diagnosis of exclusion, a variety of respiratory diseases must be ruled out before a diagnosis of VAPI can be made. The differential diagnosis should include more common diagnostic possibilities, such as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as do-not-miss diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism. Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. These processes include the following:
 Acute eosinophilic pneumonia
 COVID-19
 Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
 Giant cell pneumonitis
 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
 Lipoid pneumonia
 Organizing pneumonia
 Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease

The use of imaging and other diagnostic modalities, including chest CT, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy, may provide additional information to determine the presence of these processes and potentially establish a definitive diagnosis, but are generally not performed unless clinically indicated.

Treatment

CDC recommendations for primary care
, the CDC has published updated interim guidance based on the most current data to provide a framework for healthcare providers in their management and follow-up of persons with symptoms of VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. Once admitted, initiation of corticosteroids should be considered, which have been found to be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a group of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids, and those that began glucocorticoid therapy continued on it for at least 7 days. The medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that "respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids". Among 140 cases reported nationally to the CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved. In patients with more severe illness, a more aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids as well as antimicrobial and antiviral therapy may be warranted.

As a large proportion of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit based on data submitted to the CDC, many patients require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, high-flow oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation.

During influenza season, health care providers should consider influenza in all patients with suspected VAPI. Decisions on initiation or discontinuation of treatment should be based on specific clinical features and, when appropriate, in consultation with specialists.

Special consideration should be given to high-risk patients such as the elderly, those with a history of cardiac or lung disease, or pregnant individuals. Patients over 50 years old have an increased risk of intubation and might need longer hospitalizations.
CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. Evidence-based tobacco product quitting strategies include behavioral counseling and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-approved cessation medications.

Follow-up care 
Due to reports of relapse during corticosteroid tapers after hospitalization, the CDC recommends scheduling a follow-up visit no later than one to two weeks after discharge from inpatient hospital treatment for VAPI, with considerations for performing pulse-oximetry testing and repeat CXR. In one to two months, healthcare providers should consider additional follow-up testing, including spirometry, diffusion capacity testing, and another repeat CXR. In patients with persistent hypoxemia (O saturation <95%) requiring home oxygen at discharge, consider ongoing pulmonary follow-up. In patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids, consider endocrinology follow-up to monitor adrenal function.

As it is unknown whether patients with a history of VAPI are at increased risk for severe complications with influenza or other respiratory infections, follow-up care should also include annual vaccination against influenza for all persons over 6 months of age, including patients with a history of VAPI, as well as administration of the pneumococcal vaccine according to current guidelines.

An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products.

Public health recommendations 
The CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer.

Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Research into the effectiveness of this approach is still incomplete.

Epidemiology 

The outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The CDC has received complete gender and age data on these cases with 70% of cases being male. The median age of cases is 24 years and ranges from 13 to 85 years. 79% of cases are under 35 years old. There have been 64 confirmed deaths in 28 states and the District of Columbia from this outbreak ranging from ages 15–75 years old.

Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.

On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. A number of other probable cases have been reported in British Columbia and New Brunswick as of October 2019.

In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. One lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010.

Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use.

Before the outbreak, one lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010.

18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. Pauwaert's CBD oils were tested for vitamin E at the Saint-Luc Hospital in November 2019.  "Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) and vitamin E acetate were not detected in the vaping fluid by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection." The death is under investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived.

The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She had difficulty breathing and was admitted to the hospital in October 2019. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

 Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses, such as pneumonia, but sufferers typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Differential diagnoses have overlapping features with VAPI, including COVID-19.

Sufferers usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths.

All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. CDC data show that the outbreak peaked in September 2019, and declined steadily to a low level through January 2020. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was "driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources." However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes.

The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020.

Signs and symptoms
Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy.  In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms. Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever. Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing. Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease. In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation. Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks.

Possible causes
No single cause of these illnesses has been established . Many different substances and product sources continued to be under investigation.

Possible sources of VAPI include:
 E-liquid vaporizers
 Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. Metal coils coated with microporous ceramic have been developed to protect against oxidation of metals.
 Vape blend chemicals:
 E-liquid carrying agents:
 Glycerin (vegetable glycerin (VG)) and/or propylene glycol (PG): Glycerin was long thought to be a safe option. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. Glycerin may also cause lipid pneumonia.
 MCT oil: In vivo mouse exposure of inhaled MCT oil induces acute inflammation.
 Vitamin E acetate: On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. The CDC stated as of 11 February 2020 that previous research suggested inhaled vitamin E acetate may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaped vitamin E acetate produced exceptionally toxic ketene gas, along with carcinogenic alkenes and benzene.
 Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity.
 Psychoactive substances:
 Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Synthetic cannabinoids are increasingly offered in e-cigarette form as "c-liquid".
 Viruses
 SARS-CoV-2: Shared vaping devices are linked to COVID-19.
 Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through "dabbing." Dabbing uses a different type of device to heat and extract cannabinoids for inhalation. It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials.

Mechanism 

Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. glycerin (sold as vegetable glycerine (VG)), propylene glycol (PG)). The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown.

Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products.

VAPI appears to be a type of acute lung injury, similar to acute fibrinous pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology causing VAPI.

Diagnosis 
High clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of VAPI. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. Healthcare providers were advised to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.

All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. Additionally a detailed physical examination was recommended, specifically including vital signs and pulse-oximetry. Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which might include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, complete blood count with differential, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), liver transaminases, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC were recommended. Imaging, typically a chest X-ray, with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results did not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease were urged. It was pointed out that consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) could help guide further evaluation. The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis. Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission,  following the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis but are performed as clinically indicated to rule out the likelihood of infection.

There are non-specific laboratory abnormalities that have been reported in association with the disease, including elevations in white blood cell count (with neutrophilic predominance and absence of eosinophilia), transaminases, procalcitonin, and inflammatory markers. Infectious disease testing, including blood and sputum cultures and tests for influenza, Mycoplasma, and Legionella were all found to be negative in the majority of reported cases. Imaging abnormalities are typically bilateral and are usually described as "pulmonary infiltrates or opacities" on chest X-ray and "ground-glass opacities" on chest CT. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may exhibit an increased level of neutrophils in combination with lymphocytes and vacuole-laden macrophages. Lavage cytology with oil red O staining demonstrated extensive lipid-laden alveolar macrophages. In the few cases in which lung biopsies were performed, the results were consistent with acute lung injury and included a broad range of features, such as acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, lipid-laden macrophages, and organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsies often showed neutrophil predominance as well, with rare eosinophils.

Case definitions 
Based on the clinical characteristics of VAPI cases from ongoing federal and state investigations, interim surveillance case definitions for confirmed and probable cases have been developed.

The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:
 Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND
 Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND
 Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. Minimum criteria include:
 A negative respiratory viral panel
 A negative influenza polymerase chain reaction or rapid test if local epidemiology supports testing.
 All other clinically indicated respiratory infectious disease testing (e.g., urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, sputum culture if productive cough, bronchoalveolar lavage culture if done, blood culture, human immunodeficiency virus–related opportunistic respiratory infections if appropriate) must be negative and
 No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process).

The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:
 Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND
 Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND
 Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and
 No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process).

These surveillance case definitions are meant for public health data collection purposes and are not intended to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to guide clinical care; they are subject to change and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Differential diagnosis 
As VAPI was, as of October 2019, a diagnosis of exclusion, a variety of respiratory diseases must be ruled out before a diagnosis of VAPI can be made. The differential diagnosis should include more common diagnostic possibilities, such as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as do-not-miss diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism. Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. These processes include the following:
 Acute eosinophilic pneumonia
 COVID-19
 Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
 Giant cell pneumonitis
 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
 Lipoid pneumonia
 Organizing pneumonia
 Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease

The use of imaging and other diagnostic modalities, including chest CT, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy, may provide additional information to determine the presence of these processes and potentially establish a definitive diagnosis, but are generally not performed unless clinically indicated.

A 2020 study found that vaped vitamin E acetate produced exceptionally toxic ketene gas, along with carcinogenic alkenes and benzene.
 Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity.
 Psychoactive substances:
 Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Synthetic cannabinoids are increasingly offered in e-cigarette form as "c-liquid".
 Viruses
 SARS-CoV-2: Shared vaping devices are linked to COVID-19.
 Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through "dabbing." Dabbing uses a different type of device to heat and extract cannabinoids for inhalation. It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials.

Mechanism 

Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. glycerin (sold as vegetable glycerine (VG)), propylene glycol (PG)). The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown.

Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products.

VAPI appears to be a type of acute lung injury, similar to acute fibrinous pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology causing VAPI.

Diagnosis 
High clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of VAPI. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. Healthcare providers were advised to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.

All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. Additionally a detailed physical examination was recommended, specifically including vital signs and pulse-oximetry. Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which might include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, complete blood count with differential, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), liver transaminases, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC were recommended. Imaging, typically a chest X-ray, with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results did not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease were urged. It was pointed out that consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) could help guide further evaluation. The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis. Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission,  following the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis but are performed as clinically indicated to rule out the likelihood of infection.

There are non-specific laboratory abnormalities that have been reported in association with the disease, including elevations in white blood cell count (with neutrophilic predominance and absence of eosinophilia), transaminases, procalcitonin, and inflammatory markers. Infectious disease testing, including blood and sputum cultures and tests for influenza, Mycoplasma, and Legionella were all found to be negative in the majority of reported cases. Imaging abnormalities are typically bilateral and are usually described as "pulmonary infiltrates or opacities" on chest X-ray and "ground-glass opacities" on chest CT. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may exhibit an increased level of neutrophils in combination with lymphocytes and vacuole-laden macrophages. Lavage cytology with oil red O staining demonstrated extensive lipid-laden alveolar macrophages. In the few cases in which lung biopsies were performed, the results were consistent with acute lung injury and included a broad range of features, such as acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, lipid-laden macrophages, and organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsies often showed neutrophil predominance as well, with rare eosinophils.

Case definitions 
Based on the clinical characteristics of VAPI cases from ongoing federal and state investigations, interim surveillance case definitions for confirmed and probable cases have been developed.

The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:
 Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND
 Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND
 Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. Minimum criteria include:
 A negative respiratory viral panel
 A negative influenza polymerase chain reaction or rapid test if local epidemiology supports testing.
 All other clinically indicated respiratory infectious disease testing (e.g., urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, sputum culture if productive cough, bronchoalveolar lavage culture if done, blood culture, human immunodeficiency virus–related opportunistic respiratory infections if appropriate) must be negative and
 No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process).

The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:
 Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND
 Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND
 Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and
 No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process).

These surveillance case definitions are meant for public health data collection purposes and are not intended to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to guide clinical care; they are subject to change and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Differential diagnosis 
As VAPI was, as of October 2019, a diagnosis of exclusion, a variety of respiratory diseases must be ruled out before a diagnosis of VAPI can be made. The differential diagnosis should include more common diagnostic possibilities, such as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as do-not-miss diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism. Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. These processes include the following:
 Acute eosinophilic pneumonia
 COVID-19
 Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
 Giant cell pneumonitis
 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
 Lipoid pneumonia
 Organizing pneumonia
 Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease

The use of imaging and other diagnostic modalities, including chest CT, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy, may provide additional information to determine the presence of these processes and potentially establish a definitive diagnosis, but are generally not performed unless clinically indicated.

Treatment

CDC recommendations for primary care
, the CDC has published updated interim guidance based on the most current data to provide a framework for healthcare providers in their management and follow-up of persons with symptoms of VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. Once admitted, initiation of corticosteroids should be considered, which have been found to be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a group of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids, and those that began glucocorticoid therapy continued on it for at least 7 days. The medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that "respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids". Among 140 cases reported nationally to the CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved. In patients with more severe illness, a more aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids as well as antimicrobial and antiviral therapy may be warranted.

As a large proportion of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit based on data submitted to the CDC, many patients require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, high-flow oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation.

During influenza season, health care providers should consider influenza in all patients with suspected VAPI. Decisions on initiation or discontinuation of treatment should be based on specific clinical features and, when appropriate, in consultation with specialists.

Special consideration should be given to high-risk patients such as the elderly, those with a history of cardiac or lung disease, or pregnant individuals. Patients over 50 years old have an increased risk of intubation and might need longer hospitalizations.
CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. Evidence-based tobacco product quitting strategies include behavioral counseling and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-approved cessation medications.

Follow-up care 
Due to reports of relapse during corticosteroid tapers after hospitalization, the CDC recommends scheduling a follow-up visit no later than one to two weeks after discharge from inpatient hospital treatment for VAPI, with considerations for performing pulse-oximetry testing and repeat CXR. In one to two months, healthcare providers should consider additional follow-up testing, including spirometry, diffusion capacity testing, and another repeat CXR. In patients with persistent hypoxemia (O saturation <95%) requiring home oxygen at discharge, consider ongoing pulmonary follow-up. In patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids, consider endocrinology follow-up to monitor adrenal function.

As it is unknown whether patients with a history of VAPI are at increased risk for severe complications with influenza or other respiratory infections, follow-up care should also include annual vaccination against influenza for all persons over 6 months of age, including patients with a history of VAPI, as well as administration of the pneumococcal vaccine according to current guidelines.

An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products.

Public health recommendations 
The CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer.

Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Research into the effectiveness of this approach is still incomplete.

Epidemiology 

The outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The CDC has received complete gender and age data on these cases with 70% of cases being male. The median age of cases is 24 years and ranges from 13 to 85 years. 79% of cases are under 35 years old. There have been 64 confirmed deaths in 28 states and the District of Columbia from this outbreak ranging from ages 15–75 years old.

Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.

On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. A number of other probable cases have been reported in British Columbia and New Brunswick as of October 2019.

In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. One lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010.

Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use.

Before the outbreak, one lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010.

18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. Pauwaert's CBD oils were tested for vitamin E at the Saint-Luc Hospital in November 2019.  "Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) and vitamin E acetate were not detected in the vaping fluid by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection." The death is under investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived.

The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She had difficulty breathing and was admitted to the hospital in October 2019. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

 Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), refers to lung diseases that are associated with the use of vaping products. These conditions can be severe and pose a life-threatening risk. The symptoms of VAPI initially resemble common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals affected by VAPI typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. It is worth noting that VAPI shares overlapping features with COVID-19 and other differential diagnoses.

People who develop VAPI usually seek medical care within a few days to weeks after the onset of symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths.

All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Most samples tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive component of cannabis. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices.

The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. However, further evidence is required to establish a conclusive link. It is important to note that the information provided here is not exhaustive, and healthcare professionals should rely on up-to-date guidelines and research to diagnose and treat patients with VAPI.

Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health.

  to 80 people since March 2018, including one death in July 2018. In August 2018, there were almost one hundred overdose cases reported over two days in New Haven, Connecticut from a bad batch of K2. The synthetic cannabinoid was believed to have been mixed with fentanyl, although no fentanyl was identified in samples of the drug tested by the DEA. In September 2018, at least 10 people overdosed on a synthetic cannabinoid, either AMB-FUBINACA or AB, in Christchurch, New Zealand over two days. Some of the people are in critical condition in the Intensive Care Unit. From September 21–22, 2018, almost 50 people overdosed and two people died in the Kensington area of Philadelphia.

Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses, such as pneumonia, but sufferers typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Differential diagnoses have overlapping features with VAPI, including COVID-19. Sufferers usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. CDC data show that the outbreak peaked in September 2019, and declined steadily to a low level through January 2020. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was "driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources." However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Signs and symptoms Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms. Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever. Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing. Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease. In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation. Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks. Possible causes No single cause of these illnesses has been established . Many different substances and product sources continued to be under investigation. Possible sources of VAPI include: E-liquid vaporizers Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. Metal coils coated with microporous ceramic have been developed to protect against oxidation of metals. Vape blend chemicals: E-liquid carrying agents: Glycerin (vegetable glycerin (VG)) and/or propylene glycol (PG): Glycerin was long thought to be a safe option. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. Glycerin may also cause lipid pneumonia. MCT oil: In vivo mouse exposure of inhaled MCT oil induces acute inflammation. Vitamin E acetate: On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI.

Possible sources of VAPI include: E-liquid vaporizers Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. Metal coils coated with microporous ceramic have been developed to protect against oxidation of metals. Vape blend chemicals: E-liquid carrying agents: Glycerin (vegetable glycerin (VG)) and/or propylene glycol (PG): Glycerin was long thought to be a safe option. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. Glycerin may also cause lipid pneumonia. MCT oil: In vivo mouse exposure of inhaled MCT oil induces acute inflammation. Vitamin E acetate: On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. The CDC stated as of 11 February 2020 that previous research suggested inhaled vitamin E acetate may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaped vitamin E acetate produced exceptionally toxic ketene gas, along with carcinogenic alkenes and benzene. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances: Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Synthetic cannabinoids are increasingly offered in e-cigarette form as "c-liquid". Viruses SARS-CoV-2: Shared vaping devices are linked to COVID-19. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through "dabbing." Dabbing uses a different type of device to heat and extract cannabinoids for inhalation. It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. glycerin (sold as vegetable glycerine (VG)), propylene glycol (PG)). The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a type of acute lung injury, similar to acute fibrinous pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology causing VAPI. Diagnosis High clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of VAPI. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. Healthcare providers were advised to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. Additionally a detailed physical examination was recommended, specifically including vital signs and pulse-oximetry. Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which might include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, complete blood count with differential, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), liver transaminases, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC were recommended. Imaging, typically a chest X-ray, with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results did not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease were urged. It was pointed out that consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) could help guide further evaluation. The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis. Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission, following the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis but are performed as clinically indicated to rule out the likelihood of infection. There are non-specific laboratory abnormalities that have been reported in association with the disease, including elevations in white blood cell count (with neutrophilic predominance and absence of eosinophilia), transaminases, procalcitonin, and inflammatory markers. Infectious disease testing, including blood and sputum cultures and tests for influenza, Mycoplasma, and Legionella were all found to be negative in the majority of reported cases. Imaging abnormalities are typically bilateral and are usually described as "pulmonary infiltrates or opacities" on chest X-ray and "ground-glass opacities" on chest CT. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may exhibit an increased level of neutrophils in combination with lymphocytes and vacuole-laden macrophages. Lavage cytology with oil red O staining demonstrated extensive lipid-laden alveolar macrophages. In the few cases in which lung biopsies were performed, the results were consistent with acute lung injury and included a broad range of features, such as acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, lipid-laden macrophages, and organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsies often showed neutrophil predominance as well, with rare eosinophils. Case definitions Based on the clinical characteristics of VAPI cases from ongoing federal and state investigations, interim surveillance case definitions for confirmed and probable cases have been developed. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use: Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. Minimum criteria include: A negative respiratory viral panel A negative influenza polymerase chain reaction or rapid test if local epidemiology supports testing. All other clinically indicated respiratory infectious disease testing (e.g., urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, sputum culture if productive cough, bronchoalveolar lavage culture if done, blood culture, human immunodeficiency virus–related opportunistic respiratory infections if appropriate) must be negative and No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use: Using an e-cigarette ("vaping") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). These surveillance case definitions are meant for public health data collection purposes and are not intended to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to guide clinical care; they are subject to change and will be updated as additional information becomes available. Differential diagnosis As VAPI was, as of October 2019, a diagnosis of exclusion, a variety of respiratory diseases must be ruled out before a diagnosis of VAPI can be made. The differential diagnosis should include more common diagnostic possibilities, such as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as do-not-miss diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism. Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. These processes include the following: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia COVID-19 Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Giant cell pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Lipoid pneumonia Organizing pneumonia Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease The use of imaging and other diagnostic modalities, including chest CT, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy, may provide additional information to determine the presence of these processes and potentially establish a definitive diagnosis, but are generally not performed unless clinically indicated. Treatment CDC recommendations for primary care , the CDC has published updated interim guidance based on the most current data to provide a framework for healthcare providers in their management and follow-up of persons with symptoms of VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities
 3 3.39387 Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses, such as pneumonia, but sufferers typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Differential diagnoses have overlapping features with VAPI, including COVID-19. Sufferers usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. CDC data show that the outbreak peaked in September 2019, and declined steadily to a low level through January 2020. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was "driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources." However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Signs and symptoms Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms. Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever. Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing. Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease. In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation. Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks. Possible causes No single cause of these illnesses has been established . Many different substances and product sources continued to be under investigation.

 4 -4.65404 Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), refers to lung diseases that are associated with the use of vaping products. These conditions can be severe and pose a life-threatening risk. The symptoms of VAPI initially resemble common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals affected by VAPI typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. It is worth noting that VAPI shares overlapping features with COVID-19 and other differential diagnoses.

People who develop VAPI usually seek medical care within a few days to weeks after the onset of symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths.

All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Most samples tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive component of cannabis. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices.

The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. However, further evidence is required to establish a conclusive link. It is important to note that the information provided here is not exhaustive, and healthcare professionals should rely on up-to-date guidelines and research to diagnose and treat patients with VAPI.

Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health.
 5 -8.29450  the toxic tobacco product. Menthol appeals to younger or beginning smokers largely because the menthol masks the harshness and discomfort of inhaling smoke, making smoking more palatable. Trying menthols increases smoking initiation among youth and young adults, and menthols users face greater addiction and decreased success in quitting smoking. Young people who use menthol cigarettes are 80% more likely to become life-long smokers than those who use regular cigarettes. Likewise, studies associate youth hookah use with subsequent cigarette use, increased intensity of cigarette use, and decreased success in quitting. A 2016 study found 11- to 16-year-old English children exposed to e-cigarette advertisements highlighting flavored, in contrast to flavor-free e-cigarettes,

 the toxic tobacco product. Trying menthols increases smoking initiation among youth and young adults, and menthols users face greater addiction and decreased success in quitting smoking. Likewise, studies associate youth hookah use with subsequent cigarette use, increased intensity of cigarette use, and decreased success in quitting.

Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), refers to lung diseases that are associated with the use of vaping products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths. All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Most samples tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive component of cannabis. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices. The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. It is important to note that the information provided here is not exhaustive, and healthcare professionals should rely on up-to-date guidelines and research to diagnose and treat patients with VAPI. Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health. Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was "driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources." However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include: E-liquid vaporizers Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. The CDC stated as of 11 February 2020 that previous research suggested inhaled vitamin E acetate may interfere with normal lung functioning. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances: Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through "dabbing." It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. Healthcare providers were advised to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use.

['Scientists have long dreamed of using stem cells to repair damaged hearts, but the cells have proven difficult to coax into forming the complex, three-dimensional structures of the organ. Now, researchers have developed a technique that allows stem cells to grow into heart tissue in a lab dish, bringing the dream of stem cell-based heart repair one step closer to reality.\nThe technique, developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, involves using a gel-like substance to create a three-dimensional environment for the stem cells to grow. The gel is made of a material called alginate, which is derived from seaweed, and is mixed with a protein called collagen. The resulting gel is then seeded with stem cells and placed in a bioreactor, a device that provides nutrients and oxygen to the cells.\nThe researchers found that the stem cells grew into heart tissue in the lab dish, forming structures that resembled the left atrium, the upper left chamber of the heart. The tissue was able to contract and respond to electrical stimulation, just like heart tissue in the body.\nThe researchers say that the technique could be used to create heart tissue for use in transplants, or to develop new drugs for treating heart disease. The study was published in the journal Stem Cells.\nThe use of stem cells to repair damaged hearts has been a major focus of stem cell research in recent years. In 2010', 'Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts']

  to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death. In humans specifically, a “cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer” was found in the myocardium that renewed the cells with progenitors that differentiated into mature cardiac cells. What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells. Loss of the myocardium due to disease often leads to heart failure; therefore, it would be useful to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost. This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac

These sheets were still found to be present four weeks later. Research has also been conducted into the engineering of heart valves. Tissue-engineered heart valves derived from human cells have been created in vitro and transplanted into a non-human primate model. These showed a promising amount of cellular repopulation even after eight weeks, and succeeded in outperforming currently-used non-biological valves. In 2021, researchers demonstrated a switchable iPSCs-reprogramming-based approach for regeneration of damaged heart without tumor-formation in mice. In April 2019, researchers 3d printed a prototype human heart the size of a rabbit's heart.

Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was found to induce mitosis in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes, while treatment with FGF1 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors was found to regenerate the heart, reduce scarring, and improve cardiac function in rats with cardiac injury. One of the most promising sources of heart regeneration is the use of stem cells. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was

  Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, and have increased proportionally from 25.8% of global deaths in 1990, to 31.5% of deaths in 2013. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. In addition, during a typical myocardial infarction or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost. The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact on modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the axolotl), mammalian cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring

  were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. This was done using three transcription factors: GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5. Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously. The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration. Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted. Masumoto and his team designed a method of producing sheets of cardiomyocytes and

  In July 2008, the CCTRN opened enrollment in two studies in patients who had recently suffered heart attacks: TIME ((NCT00684021)) and LateTIME ((NCT00684060)). The purpose of these studies was to determine if stem cells safely taken from an individual’s bone marrow could be transplanted back into the injured heart muscle of the individual and improve the heart’s ability to pump following a heart attack, as well as to determine the best time for transplanting the cells following a heart attack. The results of both studies were presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific meetings in 2011 (LateTIME) and 2012 (TIME), and simultaneously

 Under a microscope inside a lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center, a dish of cells pulsates with the rhythm of a human heart.
Days ago, these building blocks of heart muscle had a different identity altogether: They were scar-forming cells that proliferate in the wake of a heart attack and weaken the organ’s ability to pump blood.
Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions.
They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming.
Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics.
Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues.
In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss.
Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver.
At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells.
The center, led by biologist Eric Olson, opened in May with a $10 million gift from the Hamon Charitable Foundation. Its areas of research include stem cells as well as direct reprogramming.
Olson hopes the center will help UT Southwestern attract top college graduates from around the U.S.
Olson’s career-long interest in how a single cell develops into the trillions that make up the human body led to his lab’s current work.
“I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said.
After pondering what cell type to focus on, Olson settled on muscle cells, because muscles make up 40 percent of our body mass and turn on thousands of genes as they develop.
The idea was that a deep understanding of one particular system could be applied more widely. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process.
Over the years, Olson’s lab has uncovered several of the major genes that control muscle development.
Recent work from his lab has led to a promising approach to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a congenital disease that causes muscles to progressively weaken and degenerate.
In the center’s inaugural publication this month in the journal Science, Olson and his colleagues outlined a way to “edit” the gene abnormalities responsible for the disorder in a mouse and rectify the body’s ability to grow healthy muscle.
Olson’s lab extended its work into heart muscle cells in the early 1990s. At the time, Deepak Srivastava, then a postdoctoral researcher, was working in the lab.
“I was trained as a pediatric cardiologist and was interested in how the heart forms in the embryo and how that goes awry in human disease,” says Srivastava, who now directs cardiac and stem cell research at the Gladstone Institutes and is a professor at the University of California San Francisco. The two went on to discover many of the genes that control heart development.
Using some of that research, Srivastava pioneered cardiac reprogramming several years later.
“We took the years of knowledge that our lab and other labs had developed about how nature normally makes a heart in the embryo and essentially redeployed those same methods in the adult heart,” he says.
In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients. Those ingredients, proteins known as transcription factors, are master regulators that flip genes on and off. The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb.
In 2012, Srivastava and Olson, writing separate papers in the same issue of the journal Nature, showed that the process could be performed successfully in living mice.
Each group used a different combination of transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that the technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack.
For the last two decades, stem cells have been virtually synonymous with regenerative medicine.
Scientists use them in many different ways. In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue.
In a second approach, scientists can extract stem cells from embryos and then convert them.
In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells.
Adult stem cells have had mixed results. “The reality is this has shown limited benefits after a decade of clinical trials,” says Olson.
So far, researchers have tried direct reprogramming in mice and in human cells in a lab dish.
Chun-Li Zhang, a colleague of Olson’s at the Hamon Institute, is using direct reprogramming to rebuild nerve cells, or neurons. He starts with glial cells, which reproduce in the brain and spinal cord following an injury and can form scars.
“Basically, these are the fibroblasts of the brain,” he says.
In a series of papers published over the last year, Zhang and his colleagues reported generating new neurons from glial cells in mice following a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. The lab is now investigating how much the new cells can contribute to the animals’ recovery.
Most scientists who work on direct reprogramming are continuing their research on stem cells in parallel. “They each have advantages and disadvantages,” says Srivastava.
George Daley, director of stem cell transplantation at Children’s Hospital Boston and a past president of the International Society of Stem Cell Research, compared the effectiveness of the two methods in a paper published last month in the journal Cell.
Neurons and heart cells created using direct reprogramming “aren’t as close to normal tissue as those generated from stem cells,” he said.
Another advantage of using stem cells is that the process creates a lot more cells to work with than direct reprogramming.
“Right now, if you take a dish of fibroblasts in a lab and reprogram that dish, you can get maybe 10 percent of those cells to turn into heart muscle cells, and we’d like to improve that efficiency,” says Olson.
Yet direct reprogramming, says Zhang, is more akin to true regeneration. “We design a way to help the tissue repair or regenerate itself,” he says. Stem cells, by contrast, involve growing cells in a dish and then injecting them into patients.
The ultimate hope with direct reprogramming is that it will lead to a drug that will stimulate patients’ bodies to heal themselves.
With both approaches, Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments are still at least several years away.
Srivastava is testing his direct reprogramming technique in pigs, whose hearts are closer in size to those of humans. The goal is to see if he can generate enough muscle to dramatically improve the heart’s pumping ability.
If all goes well, he hopes to approach the FDA with a plan for clinical trials within two to three years.
“It’s not inconceivable that we could know if this works in humans within the next five years,” he says.

This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War, which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants. They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75. This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed

 Despite what your mother told you, time cannot mend all broken hearts, but current research indicates that cord blood and cord tissue stem cells may be able to help heal the real thing.
Heart disease is the number one cause of death for both men and women in the United States. Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available.
Heart disease is an umbrella term for many kinds of heart conditions. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease, is the most common and also the source of most heart attacks. A heart attack happens when the organ is starved of oxygen, such as when a clot blocks the flow of blood. A heart attack will leave behind scar tissue that lacks muscle or blood vessels. Any part of the heart, which is basically a big muscle, that can’t contract, doesn't have a sufficient blood supply or otherwise limits the ability to pump blood could lead to further complications.
Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs.
About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. The newly formed arteries, arterioles and capillaries occupied 68 percent of the damaged portion of the ventricle nine days after the stem cells were transplanted, in effect replacing the dead tissue with living, functioning tissue. The researchers found that mice that received the transplanted cells survived in greater numbers than mice with heart attacks that did not receive the mouse stem cells.
In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. Bonnville had been accidentally shot in the heart with a nail gun while doing home repair. He underwent open-heart surgery but later suffered from a massive heart attack. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart. Doctors at the William Beaumont Hospital in Michigan harvested his stem cells, and using a heart catheter, they transplanted the stem cells into the artery that supplies blood to the front of the heart. Following the procedure, Bonnville experienced significant improvement in heart function.
In 2004, the FDA approved the first clinical trial in the United States to test stem cell therapy for severe heart failure. Prior to this clinical trial, scientists in Brazil had already tested the treatment on fourteen patients. The 2014 study's results, published in Circulation Research, showed that the procedure is safe and significantly improves heart function.
Further studies followed such as the one highlighted in a 2007 article in the International Journal of Cardiology. It reported on a study that divided 70 cardiac patients into two equal groups: one group was injected with stem cells, and the other group received a placebo. Six months later, the patients treated with stem cells had a significant improvement in left ventricular pumping, and in the control group, there was no improvement. Twenty-five patients experienced complications, but none died.
Following these studies, from 2009 to 2011, a number of statin drugs, which are used to treat high cholesterol, showed that they could enhance the efficacy of stem cells in cardiac repair.
“The finding that a drug with an excellent safety profile used widely to lower blood cholesterol is effective in improving cardiac function in hibernating myocardium is a welcome finding,” said Gen Suzuki, M.D., Ph.D., UB research assistant professor of medicine and the author of a study on one such drug.
Statin drugs showed promise, but attention on their abilities to improve outcomes has waned in recent years.
A study looking at safety and feasibility of infusing cord blood stem cells into the hearts of babies born with a defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is nearing completion, and we have already heard of one family who is sleeping better knowing their little boy is on the road to recovery.
HLHS occurs in approximately 1,000 births each year in the United States and is when the left side of the heart does not fully develop. The child must undergo a series of three surgeries over the same number of years to effectively re-plumb the blood flow to the heart.
“Prior to the 1980s and '90s, there were essentially no good surgical options for these patients,” said Dr. Joe Rossano, who heads up the cardiac center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, “but a number of very innovative surgical techniques were developed that have allowed many of these children to survive and thrive." Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, known as CHOP, is one of the leading medical centers for HLHS surgeries and treatment.
The surgeries allow the children to live relatively normal lives, but because the right side of the heart is handling the tasks of both ventricles, it has been shown to weaken with age. This would normally require the patient to undergo a heart transplant later down the road, but researchers think an infusion of cord blood could solve the problem by making the right side of the heart two times to five times stronger.
“We're finding ways of inventing new therapies to make that right heart stronger by stimulating the growth of the heart muscle and make the five-horsepower engine, a 10-horsepower engine, a 50-horsepower engine,” said Dr. Tim Nelson, who researches and conducts new HLHS treatments. “And if we make it strong enough, we believe that that has a shot at delaying and preventing transplant for a significant number of these children."
Andrea and Heath Sexton found out their son Ryals would be born with HLHS during one of their routine ultrasounds.
"We were wondering how is this going to change our lives ... Obviously, the care of a child that possibly would need a lot of help, maybe a lot of long-term help," said Heath Sexton. "And then, of course, in the back of your mind, obviously, you've read that a lot of children don't make it past three months. And, so, just thinking about, you know, am I going to be prepared ... for a funeral?"
CHOP became one of a number of institutions who joined together to help expand access to this clinical trial, and the Sextons quickly put their child in the care of the CHOP as the first family to undergo the treatment. After collecting the cord blood at the time of birth, processing it in Minnesota and cryo-preserving it for three months, the cord blood stem cells were thawed and infused directly into Ryals’s heart near the end of his second operation. In three more years, Ryals will undergo the final surgery. His family is just happy to have him home in Alabama and feel much better now that they are able to give some normalcy to Ryal’s life—and future.
In addition to being able to repair heart damage through the transplantation of stem cells into the affected area, doctors have been able to grow heart parts in the lab to eventually be placed in a damaged heart. In 2007, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a world-famous heart surgeon based at Imperial College London, and a team of researchers developed heart valve cells with stem cells. They used collagen to hold the valve tissue in shape as it grew into one-inch disk-shaped valves. Although plastic heart valves do exist, stem cell–grown valves offer a distinct advantage: "[B]ecause the patient's own stem cells are used, it eliminates the problem with rejection that happens when a heart has been donated by another person."
Presenting at the American Heart Association's annual scientific sessions in New Orleans during November 2008, cardiac surgeon Dr. Ralf Sodian reported that his team had used stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood to create tissue-engineered heart valves. Stem cells collected at birth from the umbilical cord may help doctors fashion new heart valves for children born with heart valve defects. The tissue-engineered valves would have the advantage of growing with the child, said researchers at the University Hospital of Munich.
"If we replace a valve in a child, they will need surgery several times in their lifetime because they will grow out of the devices, so the ultimate goal is to have a construct which is able to grow with the child and only have to do the surgery once," said Dr. Sodian.
In addition, stem cell-based valves offer the advantage of not experiencing the wear-and-tear issues related to metal and plastic valves.
In February 2009, researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison announced that they had taken skin cells and grown them into pulsing heart cells. In Circulation Research, Timothy Kamp, co-director of the university's Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Center, reported that the reprogrammed heart cells made in the laboratory generated electrical pulses, and in response to these pulses, they contracted. It is the collective contraction of all these cells that enables the heart to beat.
"It's an encouraging result because it shows that those cells will be useful for research and may someday be useful in therapy,'' said Kamp. "If you have a heart failure patient who is in dire straits and there are never enough donor hearts for transplantation, we may be able to make heart cells from the patient's skin cells and use them to repair heart muscle. That's pretty exciting."
More recently with the advent of 3-D printing, scientists are working toward a future where body parts bioengineered from stem cells will be able to engrafted into the human body.
A 2014 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 1,255 participants showed a reduce risk of mortality or re-hospitalization in the long-term for patients who underwent a stem cell therapy for heart disease. Unfortunately, despite some promising results, the diverse content and character of these studies and the limited understanding of basic principles, pathways and other factors have slowed progress, especially as it has to do with the one of the most complex muscles in the human body.
As scientists have been better developing an understanding of how these stem cells are aiding heart repair, they have moved more and more towards mesenchymal stem cells as a source. While found in cord blood, mesenchymal stem cells can be found in greater abundance in cord tissue. Studies using other sources of these mesenchymal stem cells such as bone marrow will continue to be performed, but cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown to have a higher proliferative potential and to be capable of differentiating into more cell types. Unfortunately, as the stem cells in cord tissue have only recently been discovered, their availability—especially in self-treatments—is greatly limited.
Between 2010 and 2015, there have been about 41 clinical trials performed using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cardiac repair. Most of these studies were in the processing of completing phase II and some were even moving into phase III. Today, more and more clinical trials using stem cells like those found in cord tissue are being used to treat heart disease. One of the larger such studies was completed in 2016. The phase II study showed significant improvements in the long-term health of the 58 patients with class III or class IV heart failure who received their own stem cells.
As scientists gain further insight into how, when, which and to what capacity stem cells can be used to treat heart conditions through these clinical trials, we grow ever closer to potentially discovering a whole new way to mend a broken heart.
The phase I trial using cord blood to treat HLHS is still recruiting with a number of collaborating hospitals.
A similar clinical trial is being conducted out of the Royal Children's Hospital in Australia.
A pair of clinical trials in China and a clinical trial in Turkey are similarly using cord tissue to treat chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle in an attempt to promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing. This study recruited patients who had heart failure, but would no longer benefit from other forms of standard treatment such as surgery or coronary artery repair procedures such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement.

Studies using other sources of these mesenchymal stem cells such as bone marrow will continue to be performed, but cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown to have a higher proliferative potential and to be capable of differentiating into more cell types. Unfortunately, as the stem cells in cord tissue have only recently been discovered, their availability—especially in self-treatments—is greatly limited. Between 2010 and 2015, there have been about 41 clinical trials performed using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cardiac repair. Most of these studies were in the processing of completing phase II and some were even moving into phase III. Today, more and more clinical trials using stem cells like those found in cord tissue are being used to treat heart disease. One of the larger such studies was completed in 2016. The phase II study showed significant improvements in the long-term health of the 58 patients with class III or class IV heart failure who received their own stem cells. As scientists gain further insight into how, when, which and to what capacity stem cells can be used to treat heart conditions through these clinical trials, we grow ever closer to potentially discovering a whole new way to mend a broken heart. The phase I trial using cord blood to

Days ago, these building blocks of heart muscle had a different identity altogether: They were scar-forming cells that proliferate in the wake of a heart attack and weaken the organ’s ability to pump blood.
Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions.
They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming.
Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics.
Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues.
In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss.
Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver.
At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells.
The center, led by biologist Eric Olson, opened in May with a $10 million gift from the Hamon Charitable Foundation. Its areas of research include stem cells as well as direct reprogramming.
Olson hopes the center will help UT Southwestern attract top college graduates from around the U.S.
Olson’s career-long interest in how a single cell develops into the trillions that make up the human body led to his lab’s current work.
“I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said.
After pondering what cell type to focus on, Olson settled on muscle cells, because muscles make up 40 percent of our body mass and turn on thousands of genes as they develop.
The idea was that a deep understanding of one particular system could be applied more widely. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process.
Over the years, Olson’s lab has uncovered several of the major genes that control muscle development.
Recent work from his lab has led to a promising approach to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a congenital disease that causes muscles to progressively weaken and degenerate.
In the center’s inaugural publication this month in the journal Science, Olson and his colleagues outlined a way to “edit” the gene abnormalities responsible for the disorder in a mouse and rectify the body’s ability to grow healthy muscle.
Olson’s lab extended its work into heart muscle cells in the early 1990s. At the time, Deepak Srivastava, then a postdoctoral researcher, was working in the lab.
“I was trained as a pediatric cardiologist and was interested in how the heart forms in the embryo and how that goes awry in human disease,” says Srivastava, who now directs cardiac and stem cell research at the Gladstone Institutes and is a professor at the University of California San Francisco. The two went on to discover many of the genes that control heart development.
Using some of that research, Srivastava pioneered cardiac reprogramming several years later.
“We took the years of knowledge that our lab and other labs had developed about how nature normally makes a heart in the embryo and essentially redeployed those same methods in the adult heart,” he says.
In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients. Those ingredients, proteins known as transcription factors, are master regulators that flip genes on and off. The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb.
In 2012, Srivastava and Olson, writing separate papers in the same issue of the journal Nature, showed that the process could be performed successfully in living mice.
Each group used a different combination of transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that the technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack.
For the last two decades, stem cells have been virtually synonymous with regenerative medicine.
Scientists use them in many different ways. In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue.
In a second approach, scientists can extract stem cells from embryos and then convert them.
In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells.
Adult stem cells have had mixed results. “The reality is this has shown limited benefits after a decade of clinical trials,” says Olson.
So far, researchers have tried direct reprogramming in mice and in human cells in a lab dish.
Chun-Li Zhang, a colleague of Olson’s at the Hamon Institute, is using direct reprogramming to rebuild nerve cells, or neurons. He starts with glial cells, which reproduce in the brain and spinal cord following an injury and can form scars.
“Basically, these are the fibroblasts of the brain,” he says.
In a series of papers published over the last year, Zhang and his colleagues reported generating new neurons from glial cells in mice following a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. The lab is now investigating how much the new cells can contribute to the animals’ recovery.
Most scientists who work on direct reprogramming are continuing their research on stem cells in parallel. “They each have advantages and disadvantages,” says Srivastava.
George Daley, director of stem cell transplantation at Children’s Hospital Boston and a past president of the International Society of Stem Cell Research, compared the effectiveness of the two methods in a paper published last month in the journal Cell.
Neurons and heart cells created using direct reprogramming “aren’t as close to normal tissue as those generated from stem cells,” he said.
Another advantage of using stem cells is that the process creates a lot more cells to work with than direct reprogramming.
“Right now, if you take a dish of fibroblasts in a lab and reprogram that dish, you can get maybe 10 percent of those cells to turn into heart muscle cells, and we’d like to improve that efficiency,” says Olson.
Yet direct reprogramming, says Zhang, is more akin to true regeneration. “We design a way to help the tissue repair or regenerate itself,” he says. Stem cells, by contrast, involve growing cells in a dish and then injecting them into patients.
The ultimate hope with direct reprogramming is that it will lead to a drug that will stimulate patients’ bodies to heal themselves.
With both approaches, Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments are still at least several years away.
Srivastava is testing his direct reprogramming technique in pigs, whose hearts are closer in size to those of humans. The goal is to see if he can generate enough muscle to dramatically improve the heart’s pumping ability.
If all goes well, he hopes to approach the FDA with a plan for clinical trials within two to three years.
“It’s not inconceivable that we could know if this works in humans within the next five years,” he says.

Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously. The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration. Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective.

This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War, which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants. They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75. This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed

  Chemical measures of lipid concentration have long been the most-used clinical measurement, not because they have the best correlation with individual outcome, but because these lab methods are less expensive and more widely available. The lipid profile does not measure LDL particles. It only estimates them using the Friedewald equation by subtracting the amount of cholesterol associated with other particles, such as HDL and VLDL, assuming a prolonged fasting state, etc.: This formula provides an approximation with fair accuracy for most people, assuming the blood was drawn after fasting for about 14 hours or longer, but does not reveal the actual LDL particle concentration because the percentage of fat molecules within the LDL particles which are cholesterol varies, as much as 8:1 variation. However, the concentration of LDL particles, and to

  There are several competing methods for measurement of lipoprotein particle concentrations and size. The evidence is that the NMR methodology (developed, automated & greatly reduced in costs while improving accuracy as pioneered by Jim Otvos and associates) results in a 22-25% reduction in cardiovascular events within one year, contrary to the longstanding claims by many in the medical industry that the superiority over existing methods was weak, even by statements of some proponents. Since the later 1990s, because of the development of NMR measurements, it has been possible to clinically measure lipoprotein particles at lower cost [under $80 US (including shipping) & is decreasing; versus the previous costs of >$400 to >$5,000] and higher accuracy.

There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low.

Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense ("buoyant") LDL. With continued research, decreasing cost, greater availability and wider acceptance of other lipoprotein subclass analysis assay methods, including NMR spectroscopy, research studies have continued to show a stronger correlation between human clinically obvious cardiovascular events and quantitatively measured particle concentrations.

  Blood tests commonly report LDL-C: the amount of cholesterol which is estimated to be contained with LDL particles, on average, using a formula, the Friedewald equation. In clinical context, mathematically calculated estimates of LDL-C are commonly used as an estimate of how much low density lipoproteins are driving progression of atherosclerosis. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States. In 2008, the ADA and ACC recognized direct LDL particle measurement by NMR as superior for assessing individual risk of cardiovascular events.

 Your cholesterol numbers help inform you of your risk of heart disease, but the standard way they’re determined doesn’t always provide the most accurate assessment. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a better way to calculate more precisely the level of so-called bad cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
“The traditional way of measuring LDL cholesterol too often underestimates it,” says Johns Hopkins cardiologist Steven Jones, M.D. This means that some high-risk patients need more aggressive treatment than they may be receiving.
Cholesterol is a waxy substance that builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, the deposits that harden and narrow the arteries. This makes it difficult for blood to be pumped effectively from the heart to the rest of the body, setting the stage for a possible future heart attack or stroke.
Cholesterol doesn’t float freely in the blood—it must be carried by lipoproteins, particles formed in the liver that are made of fat and protein. There are several types, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps remove cholesterol from the arteries and prevent fatty buildup, and various non-HDL lipoproteins, which in excess are linked to artery damage, heart disease and stroke. These include intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).
Nearly one in four people found to have LDL cholesterol in the “desirable” level through the traditional calculation method actually may have needed more aggressive treatment, according to a study at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine published in 2013 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The newer way of calculating LDL cholesterol, which the same researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Associationlater that year, provides a more individual and accurate assessment of risks.
A simple blood test called a lipoprotein panel, or lipid panel, is used to measure these lipoproteins. Results show three easily measured scores: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, another type of fat molecule. Also included is LDL cholesterol, which is normally estimated rather than directly measured. To calculate LDL, labs use a formula known as the Friedewald equation, a more expedient way to assess LDL compared with actually measuring it, (which involves a cumbersome and expensive process called ultracentrifugation).
The traditional Friedewald equation estimates LDL cholesterol this way: total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol minus triglycerides divided by five. For simplicity’s sake, the formula applies a one-size-fits-all factor of five to everyone. But Johns Hopkins researchers found that this often makes LDL cholesterol appear lower than it really is for some high-risk patients. The researchers sought a more accurate formula that would take into account specific details about a person’s cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Using a database of blood lipid samples from more than 1.3 million Americans—almost 3,000 times larger than the one used to develop the Friedewald equation—Johns Hopkins researchers developed a more accurate system for calculating LDL cholesterol. Because it’s individualized and looks at all non-HDL cholesterol—not just LDL—it can be used to make more precise decisions about treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke.
“LDL cholesterol alone is a relatively poor predictor of your risk,” Jones says. The new formula is especially useful in guiding treatment decisions for patients with high triglycerides—above 200 milligrams per deciliter—or low HDL cholesterol, those who are being treated for high-risk conditions like stroke and heart attack, or those who are trying to reach certain targets of non-HDL cholesterol.
This newer LDL cholesterol formula is being adopted by U.S. laboratories as well as others around the world. The formula is also available as a mobile device app called the LDL Cholesterol Calculator. It is available on the iTunes App Store and on Google Play, which makes it easier for physicians to implement the calculation for patients.
Researchers hope the new formula will one day be adopted by all labs that process lipid panels, as it involves using the same test currently used at the same cost.

  NMR was mentioned by the ADA and ACC, in a 28 March 2008 joint consensus statement, as having advantages for predicting individual risk of atherosclerosis disease events, but the statement noted that the test is less widely available, is more expensive [about $13.00 US (2015 without insurance coverage) from some labs which use the Vantera Analyzer ]. Debate continues that it is "...unclear whether LDL particle size measurements add value to measurement of LDL-particle concentration", though outcomes have always tracked LDL particle, not LDL-C, concentrations. Using NMR, as pioneered by researcher Jim Otvos and the North Carolina State University academic research spin-off company LipoScience, the total LDL particle concentrations, in nmol/L plasma, are typically subdivided by percentiles referenced to the 5,382 men and women, not on any lipid medications, who are participating in the MESA trial.

 Accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease. LDL cholesterol, also known as "bad" cholesterol, builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, which can harden and narrow the arteries. This can impede blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.

Traditionally, the measurement of LDL cholesterol may underestimate its actual levels. This means that some high-risk patients might not receive the aggressive treatment they need. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a more precise calculation method that provides a more individualized and accurate assessment of risks associated with LDL cholesterol.

By accurately calculating LDL cholesterol levels, healthcare professionals can identify patients who may require more aggressive treatment to manage their cholesterol and reduce their risk of heart disease. Regular screening and monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels can help guide treatment decisions and interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

To determine LDL cholesterol levels, a lipoprotein panel or lipid panel blood test is typically performed. This test provides information about different cholesterol and lipoprotein levels in the bloodstream, including LDL cholesterol. It is an important tool for assessing cardiovascular risk and informing treatment strategies.

In summary, accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is crucial for assessing their risk of heart disease and guiding appropriate treatment. This information helps healthcare professionals identify individuals who may require more aggressive interventions to manage their cholesterol levels and reduce their risk of cardiovascular events. Regular monitoring and management of LDL cholesterol levels are essential for maintaining heart health.

['In recent weeks, more than 100 bottlenose dolphins have washed up dead on the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico, from Florida to Texas. The cause of the deaths is unknown, but scientists are investigating a number of possibilities.\n\nThe first theory is that the dolphins are dying from a viral infection. Infectious disease expert Dr. David W. Guillory of the University of Florida\'s College of Veterinary Medicine says that the symptoms of the disease match those of a viral infection. "The dolphins are exhibiting respiratory distress, lethargy, and a lack of appetite," he explains. "These are all classic symptoms of a viral infection."\n\nAnother theory is that the dolphins are dying from a bacterial infection. Dr. Guillory says that this theory is less likely, but it cannot be ruled out. "Bacterial infections can be just as deadly as viral infections," he says. "We need to test the dolphins to see if there is a bacterial infection present."\n\nA third theory is that the dolphins are dying from a toxin in the water. Dr. Guillory says that this theory is also being investigated. "We are testing the water for toxins," he says. "If we find a toxin, we will need to determine its source and whether it is', 'Scientists debate cause of dolphin deaths.']

  Speculations on the causes of death have generated heated arguments. Some Ghanaians believe that with the start of the exploration of oil and gas in 2007 to 2010 eleven whales have died within three years. They believe that seismic air guns used for oil exploration generate so much noise that if a whale goes deaf it cannot survive. The academia is not sure of the causes of death of the whales. "It's definitely unusual. But what may be the cause we can't put our finger on," said A.K.

In a 2018 publication "Bottlenose dolphins can understand their partner's role in a cooperative task" DRC staff tested the ability of bottlenose dolphins to coordinate their behavior to receive a reward. In a trial, pairs of dolphins were instructed to swim across their lagoons and press an underwater button, with each dolphin assigned a button. In some trials, both dolphins were given the command at the same time; in other trials, one dolphin would receive the command up to 20 seconds before the other.

 Viral vs. Bacterial Pneumonia: What's Really the Difference?
Two of the more common types of pneumonia, an infection within your lungs, are viral and bacterial. “Both forms of pneumonia are very similar,” Dawn Turner, DO, attending physician at MedPost, Detroit Medical Center’s urgent care partner, tells Health.
So does it really matter which one you have?
Doctors will answer that question with a resounding yes, since treatment—and often, the severity of the illness—differs greatly. See what else is different between viral and bacterial pneumonia, along with the best ways to ward them off.
Why do people get pneumonia?
That depends on what type of pneumonia it is. All sorts of viruses—from the common cold to influenza—can lead to viral pneumonia, which is fairly contagious, Roger Lovell, MD, infectious disease specialist at Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center, tells Health. It passes easily between coworkers, spouses, friends, and fellow commuters.
The good news? “Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild,” notes the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Typically, you’ll improve in a few weeks.
Bacterial pneumonia often occurs after another illness, like the cold or the flu. However, most of the time, the bacteria behind bacterial pneumonia do not spread from person to person, says Dr. Lovell.
That's true for the number one cause of bacterial pneumonia: a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is found in many people’s throats naturally, generally without causing harm, says Dr. Lovell. The exception: "If you are not healthy or have problems with your immune system or have conditions that make it harder to fight off bacteria, then you are more susceptible to these bacteria, and it can lead to pneumonia," he says.
Along with viral and bacterial pneumonia, there's a third type worth knowing: fungal. This variant is far more rare and generally seen only in people with a weakened immune system due to certain conditions. Other types of pneumonia to note: necrotizing pneumonia (a rare but quite serious type of bacterial pneumonia) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (another rare disease, with unknown causes, that’s typically treated with steroids).
You may also have heard of walking pneumonia, which the American Lung Association describes as a “non-medical term” for a case of pneumonia with symptoms so mild, you can walk around without realizing you’re ill.
“Good hygiene and health practices will help you from contracting most infections,” Turner says.
You probably already know the drill here: Wash your hands frequently, avoid sneezers and their trail of tissues, and clean frequently touched surfaces—elevator buttons, handles, doorknobs—where germs can linger.
And keep your immune system strong with a nutritious diet, lots of water, and adequate sleep, Turner adds.
Vaccines are also a powerful preventive measure. Get the flu vaccine annually—influenza on its own is unpleasant, but it can also lead to pneumonia. “Get the pneumococcal vaccine if you are 65 years or older,” Turner advises; the vaccine, which protects against bacterial pneumonia, is also recommended for cigarette smokers and younger people with certain medical conditions.
If you have pneumonia—either bacterial or viral—you’ll typically have a cough that brings up sputum, fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain when you cough or take a deep breath, says Kimberly Brown, MD, MPH, an emergency medicine doctor in Memphis, Tennessee.
“It can be difficult to tell by symptoms alone whether you have viral or bacterial pneumonia,” says Dr. Brown.
But there is one potential tip-off that it’s bacterial, and not viral. “Generally, bacterial pneumonia causes the more severe symptoms,” Turner says.
Along with a physical exam, your doctor may take a sputum culture, chest X-ray, and blood work to determine if you have a viral or bacterial form of pneumonia, Turner says.
Your diagnosis is important since it helps determine treatment. “If you have viral pneumonia, I wouldn’t prescribe to you an antibiotic,” says Dr. Brown.
That’s for three important reasons. First, antibiotics simply don’t work to treat viruses. And, they can lead to unpleasant side effects (possibly even more uncomfortable than your original symptoms). Finally, unnecessary use of antibiotics means that they might not be effective when you do actually need them for treatment, says Dr. Brown. “We always strive to give the right treatment to the right patient at the right time,” she notes.
Instead of antibiotics, if you have a viral form of pneumonia, your doctor will recommend either antiviral agents or over-the-counter medications to ease your symptoms, says Dr. Lovell. Tylenol can bring down your fever, for instance, while an expectorant thins out mucus so you can cough more productively.

 Scientists have identified two genes that are switched on only when a child is suffering from a bacterial infection. This could allow doctors to quickly distinguish between a viral or bacterial illness, and identify early cases of potentially deadly infections.
The international team of scientists, led by researchers at Imperial College London, hope to now use the findings to develop a rapid test for use in hospitals and doctors' surgeries.
This would enable conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia or pneumonia - which are caused by bacterial infections - to be caught more rapidly. Such a test would also prevent children with viral infections being unnecessarily prescribed antibiotics, which are only effective against bacteria. This would help combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.
At the moment, when a child arrives at a surgery or hospital with fever, doctors have no quick method of distinguishing whether the child is suffering from bacterial or viral illness. Diagnosis relies instead on taking a sample of blood or spinal fluid, and seeing if bacteria grow in this sample. However this can take more than 48 hours.
Differentiating between viruses and bacteria is crucially important. Although viral infections are much more common than bacterial infections, the latter are far more dangerous, and lead to a deadly conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia.
Professor Michael Levin, from Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, who led the study explained: "Fever is one of the most common reasons children are brought to medical care. However every year many children are sent away from emergency departments or doctors' surgeries because the medical team thinks they have a viral infection, when in fact they are suffering from life-threatening bacterial infections - which are often only diagnosed too late. Conversely, many other children are admitted to hospital and receive antibiotics because the medical team are unable to immediately exclude the possibility of a bacterial infection - but in fact they are suffering from a virus."
Professor Levin, from the section for paediatric infectious diseases at Imperial added: "Although this research is at an early stage, the results show bacterial infection can be distinguished from other causes of fever, such as a viral infection, using the pattern of genes that are switched on or off in response to the infection. The challenge is now to transform our findings into a diagnostic test that can be used in hospital emergency departments or GP surgeries, to identify those children who need antibiotics."
In the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the scientists studied 240 children with an average age of 19 months, who arrived at hospitals with fever across the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and the USA. Once the children were diagnosed with a viral or bacterial infection using traditional methods, the team studied the genes that had been switched on in the children's white blood cells. Using a method known as RNA micro arrays, which measure changes in 48,000 genes simultaneously using only a small drop of each child's blood, the team found two genes are switched on in bacterial infections. Further tests showed these genes, called IFI44L and FAM89A, predicted a bacterial infection with 95-100 per cent accuracy.
Dr Jethro Herberg, senior lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases at Imperial, and co-author of the research added: "We are facing a growing threat from antibiotic resistant bacteria. A large proportion of antibiotic use is driven by our inability to reliably identify the small number of children with bacterial infection from the much larger number with viral infection, who do not need antibiotics. Fear of missing life-threatening infections like meningitis and septicaemia result in doctors often prescribing antibiotics and undertaking investigations such as lumber punctures just to be safe. A rapid test based on the two genes we have identified could transform paediatric practice, and allow us to use antibiotics only on those children who actually have a bacterial infection."
Vinny Smith, Chief Executive of Meningitis Research Foundation added: "We are proud to have supported the research underpinning this study over a number of years, and we are grateful to our family members who took part. This latest development is very exciting. Bacterial meningitis and septicaemia can kill in hours, and can leave survivors with life-changing after effects. Giving health professionals the tools to rapidly determine whether an infection is bacterial or viral will enable faster detection and treatment of meningitis and septicaemia."
The research team are now working on further studies to confirm the findings in larger numbers of children.

  On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid, flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters. Since March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid. According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute, "It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts, or transport of algae species via ship ballast water."

 2 1.77404 Viral vs. Bacterial Pneumonia: What's Really the Difference?
Two of the more common types of pneumonia, an infection within your lungs, are viral and bacterial. “Both forms of pneumonia are very similar,” Dawn Turner, DO, attending physician at MedPost, Detroit Medical Center’s urgent care partner, tells Health.
So does it really matter which one you have?
Doctors will answer that question with a resounding yes, since treatment—and often, the severity of the illness—differs greatly. See what else is different between viral and bacterial pneumonia, along with the best ways to ward them off.
Why do people get pneumonia?
That depends on what type of pneumonia it is. All sorts of viruses—from the common cold to influenza—can lead to viral pneumonia, which is fairly contagious, Roger Lovell, MD, infectious disease specialist at Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center, tells Health. It passes easily between coworkers, spouses, friends, and fellow commuters.
The good news? “Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild,” notes the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Typically, you’ll improve in a few weeks.
Bacterial pneumonia often occurs after another illness, like the cold or the flu. However, most of the time, the bacteria behind bacterial pneumonia do not spread from person to person, says Dr. Lovell.

['A new study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma has found that young athletes who undergo surgery for their first-time shoulder dislocation may have better outcomes than those who opt for non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, followed 100 young athletes who had experienced their first shoulder dislocation. Half of the athletes underwent surgery, while the other half received non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe results showed that the athletes who underwent surgery had a significantly lower rate of re-dislocation and a higher rate of return to sports compared to those who received non-surgical treatment. The study also found that the athletes who underwent surgery had less pain and better function in the long term.\n\nThe researchers believe that the benefits of surgery for young athletes with first-time shoulder dislocations are due to the fact that surgery can help to restore the normal anatomy of the shoulder joint, which can reduce the risk of future dislocations.\n\nHowever, the researchers also note that the decision to undergo surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis, and that non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for some athletes.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. David J.

  Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Damage to the shoulder and adjacent features can fluctuate in severity depending on the person's age, sport, position, recurring shoulder dysfunction, and many other factors. Some other common shoulder injuries are fractures to any shoulder girdle bones i.e. clavicle, ligamentous sprains such as AC joint or GH ligaments, rotator cuff injuries, different labral tears, and other acute or chronic conditions related to shoulder anatomy. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Inflammation or injury of associated tendons, bone, muscles, nerves, ligaments, and cartilage can all cause pain. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain.

 Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the "decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments." Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Eccentric contractions use less energy and actually absorb energy that will be used as heat or elastic recoil for the next movement. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Repeated-bout Effect markedly reduces DOMS. "Completing bouts of eccentric training and then repeating the workout 1 week (or more) later will result in less DOMS after the second workout." ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the

  Those who have had this procedure done are expected to have a stronger ankle, meaning their ankle will no longer give out on them. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Success can be achieved regardless how soon the ankle is repaired after a patient's ankle instability issues occur, but the results are slightly better when the surgery is performed sooner. According to another study, most patients reported good to excellent results. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. However, patients may still experience temporary soreness in the ankle upon returning to sports or other physical activity. Swelling may also occur after exercise. In which case, doctors recommend continually icing even after full recovery from the procedure. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons.

  below. Another study suggested that "shneck pain" was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti-inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement during the day and night time. All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.

  While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. The failure rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair has been shown to dramatically increase from 4% to 67% in patients with significant bone loss. The same authors subsequently reported much improved results when the Latarjet operation was used in patients with bone loss. A number of technical variations have been proposed including both open and arthroscopic variations. Complication rates are between 15 - 30%, with long term issues such as graft osteolysis continuing to be an issue

  Treatment options include surgical and non-surgical approaches. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates.

 Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City.
Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). The overall quality of the studies analyzed was variable, with only two using a randomized controlled trial design.
Of the conservatively managed knees, 136 (30.9%) sustained a repeat dislocation, while 35 (22.3%) of those treated surgically experienced another dislocation. Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. Surgery, however, was associated with significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) for knee-related quality of life, daily function, and sports and recreation compared with conservative care. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.
Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016.
The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature.
Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups.
In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Although little attention is currently paid to these characteristics, the results encourage more consideration of them when making treatment decisions, experts say.
Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said.
These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome.
However, the quality of featured studies urges caution.
Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said.
Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said.
Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

 Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes.
Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The patients’ treatment method, recovery and treatment effect were analyzed to sum up the clinical treatment experience.
Results: All the 2000 patients included in the clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. All the operations were successful. The healing time of the fracture end was 6 weeks to 10 weeks, with average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. The patients were followed up for two years after the operation. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%.
Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus.
Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect.
Anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus (Figure 1) is a very serious shoulder injury. This injury is more common in car accident patients, and the number of patients shows a very obvious upward trend year by year. The treatment of proximal humeral fracture is challenging owing to the variable deforming forces of the muscles surrounding the fractured bone and operative treatment with plate and screw fixation through a deltopectoral approach is the commonly used [1,2]. Proximal humeral fractures account for about 5% of all fractures . Patients with proximal humeral fractures are more common in the elderly over 60 years of age, and the number of elderly patients is increasing . Neer typing  and AO  typing are the most common clinical types. Open reduction and locking plate fixation is the most commonly used method for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Rueh et al.  showed that the locking plate could stabilize the proximal humerus fracture block stably through biomechanical tests.
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus.
Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. The disease is a very serious injury for badminton athletes. If not handled properly, it is likely to affect training result of badminton athletes, and even concern their entire career . Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Thus, clinical treatment is difficult.
At this stage, clinical treatment methods for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus mainly include manipulative reduction, closed reduction, external fixation and open reduction . Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. The information and results are hereby reported below.
Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Among the 2000 patients included in this clinical analysis, there were 1100 male patients, 900 female patients; the patients were aged 18 to 37 years, with average age at (28.23 ± 4.31) years. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Before undergoing open reduction surgery, all the patients received magnetic resonance test . Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. The inclusion or exclusion criteria referred to this reference . This research was approved by the Ethical Committee of Department of Physical Education, Shaanxi Institute of International Trade and Commerce according to the declaration of Helsinki promulgated in 1964 as amended in 1996, the approval number is 2012002.
All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. The specific method of open reduction surgery is: patients took supine position in the treatment for local anesthesia . After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position.
Then, the dislocated humeral head and glenoid cavity had anatomical reduction, with lacerated end of the fracture cleaned up. After the lacerated end of fracture was completely reset, T-type plate or Link anatomical plate was used to fix the fracture site of the patient. In this clinical study, 680 patients were fixed with T-type plate (smith nephew, London, Britain), 290 patients were fixed with Link structure plate (smith nephew, London, Britain) . And then normal saline was used to repeatedly wash the fracture part. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. After surgery, the fracture part of the patient was fixed with bandage. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation.
In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . These two symptoms will be obviously aggravated in case of weather changes or overstrain. Excellent rate=(excellent+good)/total number of cases*100.00%.
In the analysis of the controlled trial, statistical analysis software SPSS19.0 was used for analysis and processing of all the data generated. The measurement data were expressed as the mean ± average number (x̅ ± s), with chi-square for comparison between the groups. The count data were expressed as natural number (n) and percentage (%), with t for comparison between the groups. In the statistical analysis, 0.05 was used as the test standard, with confidence interval at 95%. When P<0.05, there is significant difference between the two groups, which is statistically significant.
All the 2000 patients included in this clinical research analysis were treated with open reduction surgery, all receiving successful results. The healing time of the fracture end was 6 weeks to 10 weeks, with average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. The patients were followed up for two years after the operation. Seen from the follow-up results of the 2000 patients, among the 2000 cases of badminton athletes, 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. Among them, symptoms of 90 patients with complications disappeared after associated treatment, with the patients cured.
The average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. Recent study has demonstrated that anatomic fracture reduction with a locked plate significantly improved functional outcomes and lowered the complication rate of unstable and displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the anatomic neck . At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Therefore, clinical researchers should choose the appropriate treatment for patients, actively carry out follow-up treatment to improve the clinical treatment efficiency and life quality of patients after surgery. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. It is worth noting that, after surgery, patients should actively cooperate with rehabilitation therapy to actively prevent the occurrence of a variety of complications. Only in this way can they achieve the best treatment effect, so that patients’ quality of life can be guaranteed . The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. It is believed that in the future development, treatment regimen for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will be more scientific and rational, benefiting more patients with such diseases .

  Non-surgical treatment used to involve very long periods in a series of casts, and took longer to complete than surgical treatment. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. It used to be that patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities. Modern studies including non-surgical patients generally limit non-weight-bearing

 Many patients come to Iran from different parts of the world to seek orthopedics care and surgeries. Orthopedics in Iran, hospitals and facilities present some of the most advanced ,Orthopedics in Iran technologies in this fields and state-of-the-art and orthopedic equipment.
Patients with joint diseases, knee arthritis, and weight gain related joint problems can take advantage of high quality Orthopedic care services such as knee surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Iran’s professional doctors and surgeons with high medical knowledge and experience, are at par with highly advanced countries in this field.
Iranian Orthopedic Surgeons Association, established in 1973, is one of the oldest associations in the country expanded after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Currently, over 850 orthopedists in Iran are members of this association.
Orthopedics in Iran is a specialty of immense breadth and variety. Orthopedic surgeons treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including: fractures and dislocations, torn ligaments, sprains, and strains, tendon injuries, pulled muscles, and bursitis, ruptured disks, sciatica, low back pain, and scoliosis, knock knees, bow legs, bunions, and hammer toes, arthritis and osteoporosis, one tumors, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, club foot and unequal leg length, abnormalities of the fingers and toes and growth abnormalities.
repair is an outpatient surgical procedure to repair torn knee cartilage. The torn meniscus is repaired by a variety of minimally invasive techniques and requires postoperative protection to allow healing.
Total knee replacement (total knee arthroplasty), is a surgical technique in which damaged portions of the knee joint are replaced with artificial parts (plastic and metal parts).
but this type of surgery allows surgeons to use less cutting of the tissue surrounding the knee.
The NAVIO system is a development in the procedure our orthopedic surgeons carry out partial knee replacement. The system works with the surgeon’s skilled hands to reach the accurate positioning of the knee implant based on each patient’s unique anatomy.
This technique lets surgeon to see the knee joint without making a large incision through the skin and other soft tissues. Arthroscopy is used to recognize and cure a wide type of knee damages.
This procedure is often carried out in both an outpatient surgical center and a hospital’s operating room. A small incision is made at the knee joint so the surgeon may insert the arthroscope, a long, narrow tube-like instrument with a viewing eyepiece on one end, into the joint.
If considerable damage is available within all three joint sections, a total knee replacement most likely will be recommended; however, if only one requires intervention, a partial knee replacement may be considered.
Replacement surgery (Knee Surgery) is one of the most prevalent bone surgeries. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic.
A meniscus tear is a most usual knee cartilage damage. All people particularly those who play contact sports, are exposed to meniscus tears. The meniscus is the soft rubbery bumper cushion that sits between the thigh bone and the leg bone.
The knees have four major ligaments. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the front ligament and it is one of the most common damage among athletes. Two of the knee ligaments are collateral, or toward the side of the knee joint the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) may rupture after a hard hit to the outside of the knee. Like the LCL, the medial collateral ligament rests on the side of the knee. The MCL faces inward toward the opposite knee. The fourth ligament and the ligament that is toward the back of the knee is the posterior cruciate ligament. The cruciate ligaments like the ACL and PCL cross over one another. The PCL lies toward the back of the knee and it can tear whenever the joint improperly bends.
For often people occur one episode of dislocation of the patella with no further recurrence. Surgery for curing this case, is not essential. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is a surgical method showed in patients with more severe patellar instability. MPFL is the major ligament which stabilizes the patella and helps in preventing patellar subluxation (partial dislocation) or dislocation.
Paediatric surgery is a subspecialty of surgery including the surgery of fetuses, infants, children, adolescents, and young adults.
This is a new procedure that helps the doctors attain more precision during surgery. GPS technology uses in this technique, similar to what you have in your car, and 3D computer images to help the surgeon and improve the accuracy of the surgery.
Damages to the musculoskeletal system, such as fractured or dislocated bones, broken, and soft tissue injuries known as Trauma. Trauma Surgery is a subspecialty of orthopedic medicine that requires fellowship training beyond the usual orthopedic surgical residency.
In this surgery, both knees are replaced at the same time. It’s relatively unusual to have the arthritis in both knees reach the same degree at the same time where a bilateral would be a consideration.
Sports damages occur when engaging in sports or exercise. Sports damages have different causes such as overtraining, lack of conditioning, and improper form or technique. Failing to warm up increases the possibility of sports injuries.
Hip arthroscopy (hip scope) is a surgical procedure to the viewing of the interior of the hip joint through an arthroscope (which inserted into the body through a small incision) and diagnose of hip pathology through a minimally invasive approach. Since 1990s, the advances in arthroscopic surgical equipment has allowed surgeons to treat problems that were untreatable or which required more open procedures.
Hemi Hip replacement (Hemiarthroplasty): unlike THR During the hemiarthroplasty procedure the surgeon replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface. After surgery physical therapy begins as soon as the patient feels comfortable to restore function and movement to the joint. Most patients have positive results after this surgery.
Hip resurfacing (Resurfacing of the hip joint) has been developed as an alternative form of THR. The concept of this surgery is an effort to save the bone during the replacement of an artificial hip joint. This preservation of bone has some advantages and choosing between THR and Hip replacement is very important decision that your doctor can make. The experience of surgeon with hip resurfacing is the most important; thus choosing the right surgeon is absolutely essential for a positive outcome.
hip abnormalities or hip joint traumatic and relative problems are not restricted to adults. When a child has such problems the physical immaturity of their bones requires some special consideration which some surgeons cannot handle. In children surgery suggested when it is the only treatment to the joint.
surgeons may use computer assisted surgery (CAS) technology, during hip surgeries to ensure implants are in proper places and aligned correctly which also may help the new joint feel more natural. This technology is an interactive system consisting of: 1. An infrared navigation camera 2. Smart Instruments with LED technology ۳٫ A computer with specialized surgical navigation software.
A proximal hip replacement surgery, also known as hip arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure that aims to restore strength and function back in a disabled, or damaged, hip joint.
Especially older athletes who have been highly active in their 20’s and 30’s athletes can experience hip pain, as a result of many circumstances: Hip pointer, Bone fractures, Muscle strains and tendinitis, Stress fractures, Muscle tendon bursitis, Contusion (bruise, commonly called a hip “pointer”), Hip labral tears, Osteoarthritis Sport hip injuries are usually identified via a detailed examination by a qualified sports-medicine physician. Diagnostic tests may include imaging techniques such as X-ray or MRI.
The largest tendon in the body called Achilles tendon. It’s the tissue that connects your heel bone to your calf muscles and you use it when you walk or jump and run. While the Achilles tendon can endure great stresses from jumping and running, it is also vulnerable to injury. A “rupture of the tendon” is a separation and tearing of the tendon fibers thus the muscle can no longer perform its normal function. After an injury retrieval Achilles tendon function is critical. The goal to re-join the calf muscles with the heel bone to restore normal muscles activities.
total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) also known as total ankle replacement is a surgery that use to treat ankle arthritis and replace the damaged surfaces of ankle joint with artificial implants. Ankle replacement mostly done when u are under general anesthesia. Your surgeon will make incision to expose joint. Then the doctor will remove damaged bone and replace with some metal and plastic parts. After surgery you need to stay in hospital at least for one night.
It’s also known as ankle arthrodesis is usually done to treat arthritis in the ankle. Probably an ankle fracture is the most usual cause of arthritis of the ankle. If patients have severe ankle arthritis and more conventional methods have failed they can be candidates for an ankle arthrodesis. A fusion is a very good operation for treating a damaged joint for the ankle, especially when the patient is young and very active.
Bunion or hallux valgus is an abnormal bony bump at the big toe caused by misalignment of the bone and soft tissues around the joint. In Bunion surgery, the operation is performed with very small incisions, only a few millimetres long. The aim of this surgery is to relieve pain and realign the soft tissues and bone which is the cause of the joint deformity.
In foot and ankle surgery, minimally invasive refers to a type of surgery that has either a very small incision or no incision at all. Minimally invasive ankle surgeries have many advantages, including: Less injury, Less pain, Shorter surgery time. Some of these procedures include: ankle arthroscopy, fusions and gluing the joints together, for example the ankle joint and hindfoot joints.
Ankle reconstruction surgery is performed to correct the structures of the ankle and restore its natural functionality that has been lost cause by injury or disease. This surgery is typically carried out as a day case procedure. general anaesthetic is given and an injection is used around the ankle so that it’s numb and it will be pain-free after the surgery. When a effective solution is required, a surgical ankle reconstruction can cure ankle instability quickly and effectively.
Since the child is growing, Pediatric ankle disorders differ from those in adults. These conditions may be present at birth or develop later as the child grows which they can affect the way the child’s foot or ankle works. The most appropriate treatment for ankle disorders in children depends on the age of the child. In cases which surgery is needed to correct Pediatric ankle disorders, the aim is to maintain the optimum range of motion and function of the child.
A bone can get fractured or broken completely or partially that may be usually caused from trauma due to fall, accidents or sports. In cases with severe fracture, stabilizing apparatuses such as plates or screws is necessary. In cases involving high impact injuries or bone reconstruction and repositioning surgeries, a trauma specialist is needed to provide optimum treatment.
Soft tissue conditions happen due to trauma or overuse of muscles, tendons or ligaments. The cause of these injuries is mostly a sudden movement, although soft tissue injuries can also happen due to extreme overuse of fatigued parts which grow gradually, when a speicific activity is repeated over time. Arthroscopy is used to detect certain soft tissue conditions when the exact cause of ankle symptoms is unknown.
The foot joints become unstable if the ligaments get damaged. Ligament injuries often happen due to sports injury. If a ligament is torn, the knee movement is limited significantly. Artificial ligaments are designed as surgical implants in the case of natural ligament loss or as a reinforcement structure. Using artificial ligaments has some noticable advantages in comparison to other methods. Artificial ligaments accelerate the bone healing and integration process.
Limb lengthening surgery is used to replace missing bones and to lengthen or straighten bone structures which are deformed. This surgery can be performed for both children and adults. Through the limb lengthening process, new bone and soft tissues including skin, muscle, nerves, etc. will gradually grow. Some of the indications of this surgery include: Leg Length Discrepancy, Bone Loss, post Traumatic Bone Deformities.
Bunionectomy is a surgery performed to cut or remove a bunion. A bunion is made up of bone and soft tissue and it appears when the joint at the base of the big toe gets enlarged. This condition makes walking and other activities extremely painful. The number one cause of bunions is wearing shoes that are too small or too tight. When conservative procedures such as using wide toed shoes and medication, are unsuccessful, bunionectomy is necessary to relieve your pain.
Although most sports injuries may not require surgery, but very severe injuries like broken bones require appropriate treatment, including manipulation or surgery in order to fix the damaged bones using wires, plates, rods, etc. In some cases the displaced bones can get realigned without a surgical procedure, but injuries such as a torn knee ligament, needs surgery to get repaired.
Total shoulder replacement or arthroplasty, refers to a procedure for treating arthritis or degenerative joint disease of the shoulder joint. The objective of shoulder replacement surgery is to relief the pain and to restore the motion and function of the joint. This procedure involves the replacement of the arthritic ball with an artificial metal ball. When conservative treatments such as medications and are unsuccessful, shoulder replacement surgery can be considered to relieve your pain.
The main difference between a conventional total shoulder replacement and a reverse replacement is that in a reverse replacement procedure, the metal ball and socket and are switched so their natural position is reversed. In the case of failed conventional total shoulder replacements or failed fracture surgery, the reverse total shoulder replacement surgery is an appropriate option. Also for patients with cuff tear arthropathy, this procedure is more successful because different muscles are involved in it to move the arm.
Acromioplasty is an arthroscopic procedure of the acromion, top of the shoulder blade. In the shoulder acromioplasty surgery, a small part of the acromion surface that is the cause of the tendon tissue damage is shaved. The objective of acromioplasty is to remove the roughness of the structure while maintaining its normal supporting parts. This Surgery is used to smooth the bones and create more space for the rotator cuff so that the shoulder can move with less pain.
Arthroscopy is a procedure used in orthopedics to examine, diagnose, and repair tissues inside or around the shoulder joint. In this procedure, a tiny camera called arthroscope is used to inspect or repair the tissue. In this operation, very small incisions are used to insert the camera through the skin. Shoulder arthroscopy may be indicated if the shoulder joint is damaged due to arthritis, an injury, or other conditions.
Shoulder fracture is often a result of traumatic events such as falling from a height, sports or motor vehicle accidents. Shoulder pain, swelling and having difficulty with moving the arm are the common symptoms of shoulder fracture. Various factors including the involved bones in the fracture and amount of the displacement determine the appropriate treatment and management plan for these injuries. The fracture may be displaced or non-displaced. While non-displaced fracture can be treated with non-surgical procedures, surgery may be a necessity to realign the bones in displaced fractures.
A Bankart tear is a particular injury to a part called the labrum of the shoulder. When the labrum is torn, it may lead to shoulder instability. This injury usually occurs due to the dislocation of the shoulder joint. Pain in the front of the shoulder associated with clicking or catching sensations are common symptoms of Bankart tear. Younger patients and athletes who are involved in high-risk sports, are more susceptible to have dislocations repeatedly so they are advised to have surgical treatment.
Shoulder dislocation occurs when the upper arm bone separates from the shoulder blade at the shoulder joint. An extreme force or rotation of the shoulder like an accident or a fall is often the cause of the shoulder dislocation which can result in intense pain, arm numbness, weakness and swelling. Shoulder dislocation has to be treated and shoulder get relocated as soon as possible. Surgical treatment for shoulder dislocation may be recommended if patients are unwilling to end their high-risk sport activities or if they are suffering from recurrent dislocations.
Shoulder reconstruction surgery is performed to improve stability and function of the Shoulder in patients with shoulder instability. This condition occurs due to injuries of the structures surrounding the shoulder joint such as the ligaments. In Shoulder reconstruction surgery, the torn or stretched ligaments are repaired in order to better support the shoulder joint. When conservative treatments such as physical therapy and are unsuccessful, shoulder reconstruction surgery may be recommended to relieve the shoulder instability.
Shoulder arthritis is usually a chronic condition and can result in disability. Shoulder arthritis occurs due to the loss of the smooth cartilage covering the surfaces of the ball and socket. Some of the most common types of shoulder arthritis are osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis and cuff tear arthropathy. Pain during activity is the most common symptom of shoulder arthritis that may also appear at rest. When non-surgical treatments fail to control shoulder arthritis, shoulder arthritis surgery may be a necessity.
The shoulder receives its nerve supply through a complex network of nerves. These nerves can be damaged along their way from the neck to the shoulder due to various injuries and diseases such as infection, nerve inflammation, Compression or entrapment of the nerve. These injuries can result in pain and strength loss of muscles. Nerve conduction tests are performed to obtain accurate information upon the nerve injury type and severity for diagnosing the disease and defining the appropriate treatment.
The rotator cuff is made up of a group of tendons forming a cuff over the shoulder to help stabilize and move the shoulder. A combination of overuse, injury and weakening of the tendons may results in the rotator cuff injury. If non-surgical treatments fail to improve the torn rotator cuff pain, surgery may be advised as an option. In the surgery procedure, the torn tendon is reattached to the upper arm bone so that it gets repaired.
The aim of Shoulder resection arthroplasty surgery is to repair the acromioclavicular (AC) joint of the shoulder. This joint is where the acromion and the collarbone meet. The AC joint may develop osteoarthritis in middle age which leads to pain and difficulty for shoulder movement in everyday activities. And old injury such as an acromioclavicular dislocation, may also lead to AC joint disease. Shoulder resection arthroplasty surgery is performed to restore the function, stability and motion range of the injured shoulder.
Athletic activities that involve excessive and repetitive movement such as swimming and weightlifting may lead to shoulder sport injuries and makes athletes more susceptible to these problems. Some of the most common shoulder injuries include dislocations, rotator cuff injuries and fractures. Contact sports like wrestling are more likely to cause dislocations, while sports which involve heavy weight lifting may cause rotator cuff injuries. Depending on the injury type, there are various treatments and in severe conditions, shoulder surgery may be required.
The aim of joint replacement surgery which is also called arthroplasty, is to treat symptoms of arthritis to restore the joint function and motion. In cases of severe tumors or trauma this surgery may be a necessity. In this surgical procedure, artificial metal and plastic structures are replaced with the worn joint. Also when non-surgical treatments including therapy or medication fail to handle the pain of end stage arthritis, joint replacement is recommended.
In arthroscopic surgery, a tiny camera called arthroscope is used to diagnose or repair injuries inside a joint which is inserted through the skin using very small incisions. By using Elbow, wrist and hand arthroscopy the cartilage surfaces of all bones inside the joints are visualized and the ligaments between various bones of the joint can be evaluated more accurately. It is also used to remove small fracture debris and realign the bone’s broken pieces.
In cases which the elbow is severely injured or elbow arthritis causes pain that non-surgical treatments like medication fail to control it, elbow surgery may be a necessity. Also if the nerves and blood vessels are injured due to elbow injuries, or an open elbow injury has caused one or more of the elbow bones to come through the skin, surgical procedure is often needed. The most common elbow surgeries include fracture repair, elbow arthroscopy and elbow replacement.
Hands serve us during many everyday activities such as writing, eating, etc. the hands need to have movement and sensation in their muscles, tendons and joints to function properly. When the hand is injured due to trauma or various hand diseases, different types of tissues and joints need to be treated in order to restore the function and motion range of the hand. In cases which non-surgical procedures such as hand therapy or medication fail to treat hand conditions and relieve the pain, hand surgery is recommended.
Trigger finger is a common condition which causes pain and locking sensation in fingers and it happens when the tendons of one or more fingers get inflamed. It mostly occurs in the thumb, ring and middle finger. Feeling pain when straightening or bending the affected finger and swelling are common symptoms of Trigger finger condition. When conservative treatments fail to treat this condition, surgery may be recommended so that the affected tendon can move freely.
Arthritis is a disease which occurs due to the loss of the cartilage around the joints. This condition affects the function of the joints and causes pain and inflammation. In cases which non-surgical procedures such as medication fail to relieve the pain and restore function of the joints, surgery is recommended.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition which occurs when the median nerve inside the wrist is compressed. This condition results in pain and inflammation in the arm and hand. If conservative procedures fail to treat this condition and relieve the pain, surgery may be recommended to cut the carpal ligament to make enough space for the nerve. The ligament grows back together after the surgery, but this time it will not compress the median nerve.
Dupuytren’s Contracture is a disease that affects the fascia, which is located in the palm and fingers, below the surface of the skin. This condition can affect the function of the hand and result in disability. The appropriate treatment depends on the severity of the disease. In severe cases which non-surgical procedures fail to treat the symptoms and restore hand function, surgery may be required. fasciotomy and fasciectomy are two common surgical procedures to treat Dupuytren’s Contracture.
Compressive neuropathies occur due to pressure on peripheral nerves and may result in disability. Carpal tunnel syndrome a common type of this condition which affects the wrist. Various treatments can be used to decompress the diseased nerve. If conservative procedures fail to relieve pain and restore function, surgery may be recommended to treat compressive neuropathies.
These nerves can be damaged along their way from the shoulder to the fingertips due to various injuries and diseases such as infection, nerve inflammation, Compression or entrapment of the nerve. These injuries can result in pain and affect the function of the arm and hand. In severe cases which the nerve is crushed or cut, surgery may be recommended. Surgical procedures may be used to decompress, repair or graft nerves.
Hand, wrist and elbow fractures are often a result of traumatic events such as falling from a height, sports or motor vehicle accidents. Pain and swelling are the common symptoms of bone fracture. The aim of this treatment is to relieve the pain, repair the fractured bone and restore function. The appropriate treatment depends on the severity of the fracture. For example a dislocated finger can be treated without surgery, while a dislocated elbow may need surgical treatment.
The biceps is the main muscle in the front of the upper arm which is attached to the elbow and shoulder by tendons. The biceps functions to make the elbow bending and forearm rotation possible. Ruptures of the biceps tendon are most often caused by trauma or sudden injury. Surgical treatment may be required to repair the torn tendon and restore strength of the arm.
Athletic activities that involve excessive and repetitive movement may lead to hand, wrist and elbow sport injuries. Sports which involve throwing or swinging may result in elbow injury while sports such as football involving catching may lead to injuries of fingers, hand and wrist. Golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis) and tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) are examples of common sport injuries. The appropriate treatment depends on various factors such as the severity of the injury. If conservative treatments such as therapy and medication fail to relieve symptoms, surgical procedures may be recommended.
Disks are located between the bones in the spine which function to absorb shocks and support the spine. If a disk extends beyond its capsule, it is called a herniated disk. This condition can occur anywhere in the spine, but it mostly happens in the lower back. A herniated disk may occur due to various reasons such as lifting something in the wrong way or overweight. If non-surgical procedures such as pain relievers and physical therapy fail to treat this condition, surgical treatments like laminectomy and diskectomy may be recommended.
If a disk extends beyond its capsule, it is called a herniated disk and if it pushes against a nerve it may cause pain, weakness and numbness. Disk removal or discectomy is a surgical procedure which involves removing a part of the herniated disk that is pushing against the nerve root. Sometimes the entire disk is removed. Microdiskectomy is a similar procedure which is a less invasive newer method, using a smaller incision to treat herniated disks.
Laminectomy which is also called decompression surgery, is a surgical procedure that involves removing the lamina (vertebral arch) to enlarge the spinal canal and relieve pressure on the nerve roots. Laminotomy is a similar procedure which uses a small incision and only removes a small part of the lamina. This surgery is effective for treating spinal stenosis.
Spinal fusion which is also called arthrodesis, is a surgical procedure which involves permanently joining vertebrae (small bones of the spine) together. This surgery is effective for treating many spinal conditions. Spinal fusion may decrease flexibility, but it can relieve symptoms of various spinal problems such as spinal stenosis, herniated disks, tumors, scoliosis and spinal weakness.
Percutaneous Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which uses a small puncture in the skin to inject bone cement into the fractured vertebra. The goal of this procedure is to relieve spinal pain caused by vertebral fractures and to restore mobility.
Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure similar to vertebroplasty which uses a small puncture in the skin to inject a specific cement into the fractured vertebra. The goal of this procedure is to relieve spinal pain caused by vertebral compression fractures and to stabilze the bone. Kyphoplasty can also be used to restore the lost vertabral hight by creating space between the fractured parts, using a balloon tamp.
Limb and spine deformities are disorders which affect the bone structures. These deformities are usually congenital (present at birth) and may cause abnormality in the child’s bone structure, for example one of the limbs may be larger or smaller than normal, or there may be a missing segment in the bone structure. There are various treatments for congenital deformities which are used to encourage development and improve the appearance of the diseased structure. If non-surgical procedures fail to treat these conditions, surgery may be necessity.
Gain or walking abnormalities can occur due to genetics or other reasons like injury or disease. The term “gait” refers to the movement pattern during walking. These abnormalities affect the nerves, muscles bones of the legs. Physical therapy and medical care can be used to treat this condition. In more severe cases, pharmacological therapy may also be required.
Broken bones which are also called fractures, is a common injury among young children. They usually occur due to falls, while more severe fractures are caused by car accidents. Bone fracture is different in children, because the bones have more flexibility and a thicker covering, so they can better absorb shock. Most of the bone fractures in children can be treated with non-surgical procedures. In more severe cases, surgery may be recommended.
Tumors and infections can affect the bones or joints in children. Septic arthritis is a joint infection which mostly affects the elbow, wrist, hip, shoulder and knee. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection which affects the arm and leg long bones in children. Common pediatric tumors include ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. There are a wide range of treatments for these pediatric diseases, the appropriate procedure depends on various factors such as the type and stage of the condition.

 1 2.67709 Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City.
Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). The overall quality of the studies analyzed was variable, with only two using a randomized controlled trial design.
Of the conservatively managed knees, 136 (30.9%) sustained a repeat dislocation, while 35 (22.3%) of those treated surgically experienced another dislocation. Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. Surgery, however, was associated with significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) for knee-related quality of life, daily function, and sports and recreation compared with conservative care. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.
Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016.
The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature.
Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups.
In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Although little attention is currently paid to these characteristics, the results encourage more consideration of them when making treatment decisions, experts say.
Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said.
These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome.
However, the quality of featured studies urges caution.
Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said.
Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said.
Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

 2 1.41835 Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The patients’ treatment method, recovery and treatment effect were analyzed to sum up the clinical treatment experience. Results: All the 2000 patients included in the clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. All the operations were successful. The healing time of the fracture end was 6 weeks to 10 weeks, with average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. The patients were followed up for two years after the operation. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus (Figure 1) is a very serious shoulder injury. This injury is more common in car accident patients, and the number of patients shows a very obvious upward trend year by year. The treatment of proximal humeral fracture is challenging owing to the variable deforming forces of the muscles surrounding the fractured bone and operative treatment with plate and screw fixation through a deltopectoral approach is the commonly used [1,2]. Proximal humeral fractures account for about 5% of all fractures . Patients with proximal humeral fractures are more common in the elderly over 60 years of age, and the number of elderly patients is increasing . Neer typing and AO typing are the most common clinical types. Open reduction and locking plate fixation is the most commonly used method for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Rueh et al. showed that the locking plate could stabilize the proximal humerus fracture block stably through biomechanical tests. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. The disease is a very serious injury for badminton athletes. If not handled properly, it is likely to affect training result of badminton athletes, and even concern their entire career . Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Thus, clinical treatment is difficult. At this stage, clinical treatment methods for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus mainly include manipulative reduction, closed reduction, external fixation and open reduction . Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. The information and results are hereby reported below. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Among the 2000 patients included in this clinical analysis, there were 1100 male patients, 900 female patients; the patients were aged 18 to 37 years, with average age at (28.23 ± 4.31) years. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Before undergoing open reduction surgery, all the patients received magnetic resonance test . Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. The inclusion or exclusion criteria referred to this reference . This research was approved by the Ethical Committee of Department of Physical Education, Shaanxi Institute of International Trade and Commerce according to the declaration of Helsinki promulgated in 1964 as amended in 1996, the approval number is 2012002. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. The specific method of open reduction surgery is: patients took supine position in the treatment for local anesthesia . After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position. Then, the dislocated humeral head and glenoid cavity had anatomical reduction, with lacerated end of the fracture cleaned up. After the lacerated end of fracture was completely reset, T-type plate or Link anatomical plate was used to fix the fracture site of the patient. In this clinical study, 680 patients were fixed with T-type plate (smith nephew, London, Britain), 290 patients were fixed with Link structure plate (smith nephew, London, Britain) . And then normal saline was used to repeatedly wash the fracture part. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. After surgery, the fracture part of the patient was fixed with bandage. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . These two symptoms will be obviously aggravated in case of weather changes or overstrain. Excellent rate=(excellent+good)/total number of cases*100.00%. In the analysis of the controlled trial, statistical analysis software SPSS19.0 was used for analysis and processing of all the data generated. The measurement data were expressed as the mean ± average number (x̅ ± s), with chi-square for comparison between the groups. The count data were expressed as natural number (n) and percentage (%), with t for comparison between the groups. In the statistical analysis, 0.05 was used as the test standard, with confidence interval at 95%. When P<0.05, there is significant difference between the two groups, which is statistically significant. All the 2000 patients included in this clinical research analysis were treated with open reduction surgery, all receiving successful results. The healing time of the fracture end was 6 weeks to 10 weeks, with average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. The patients were followed up for two years after the operation. Seen from the follow-up results of the 2000 patients, among the 2000 cases of badminton athletes, 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. Among them, symptoms of 90 patients with complications disappeared after associated treatment, with the patients cured. The average healing time at (8.04 ± 0.15) weeks. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. Recent study has demonstrated that anatomic fracture reduction with a locked plate significantly improved functional outcomes and lowered the complication rate of unstable and displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the anatomic neck . At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Therefore, clinical researchers should choose the appropriate treatment for patients, actively carry out follow-up treatment to improve the clinical treatment efficiency and life quality of patients after surgery. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. It is worth noting that, after surgery, patients should actively cooperate with rehabilitation therapy to actively prevent the occurrence of a variety of complications. Only in this way can they achieve the best treatment effect, so that patients’ quality of life can be guaranteed . The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. It is believed that in the future development, treatment regimen for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will be more scientific and rational, benefiting more patients with such diseases .

 3 -1.14407 Many patients come to Iran from different parts of the world to seek orthopedics care and surgeries. Orthopedics in Iran, hospitals and facilities present some of the most advanced ,Orthopedics in Iran technologies in this fields and state-of-the-art and orthopedic equipment. Patients with joint diseases, knee arthritis, and weight gain related joint problems can take advantage of high quality Orthopedic care services such as knee surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Iran’s professional doctors and surgeons with high medical knowledge and experience, are at par with highly advanced countries in this field. Iranian Orthopedic Surgeons Association, established in 1973, is one of the oldest associations in the country expanded after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Currently, over 850 orthopedists in Iran are members of this association. Orthopedics in Iran is a specialty of immense breadth and variety. Orthopedic surgeons treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including: fractures and dislocations, torn ligaments, sprains, and strains, tendon injuries, pulled muscles, and bursitis, ruptured disks, sciatica, low back pain, and scoliosis, knock knees, bow legs, bunions, and hammer toes, arthritis and osteoporosis, one tumors, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, club foot and unequal leg length, abnormalities of the fingers and toes and growth abnormalities. repair is an outpatient surgical procedure to repair torn knee cartilage. The torn meniscus is repaired by a variety of minimally invasive techniques and requires postoperative protection to allow healing. Total knee replacement (total knee arthroplasty), is a surgical technique in which damaged portions of the knee joint are replaced with artificial parts (plastic and metal parts). but this type of surgery allows surgeons to use less cutting of the tissue surrounding the knee. The NAVIO system is a development in the procedure our orthopedic surgeons carry out partial knee replacement. The system works with the surgeon’s skilled hands to reach the accurate positioning of the knee implant based on each patient’s unique anatomy. This technique lets surgeon to see the knee joint without making a large incision through the skin and other soft tissues. Arthroscopy is used to recognize and cure a wide type of knee damages. This procedure is often carried out in both an outpatient surgical center and a hospital’s operating room. A small incision is made at the knee joint so the surgeon may insert the arthroscope, a long, narrow tube-like instrument with a viewing eyepiece on one end, into the joint. If considerable damage is available within all three joint sections, a total knee replacement most likely will be recommended; however, if only one requires intervention, a partial knee replacement may be considered. Replacement surgery (Knee Surgery) is one of the most prevalent bone surgeries. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic. A meniscus tear is a most usual knee cartilage damage. All people particularly those who play contact sports, are exposed to meniscus tears. The meniscus is the soft rubbery bumper cushion that sits between the thigh bone and the leg bone. The knees have four major ligaments. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the front ligament and it is one of the most common damage among athletes. Two of the knee ligaments are collateral, or toward the side of the knee joint the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) may rupture after a hard hit to the outside of the knee. Like the LCL, the medial collateral ligament rests on the side of the knee. The MCL faces inward toward the opposite knee. The fourth ligament and the ligament that is toward the back of the knee is the posterior cruciate ligament. The cruciate ligaments like the ACL and PCL cross over one another. The PCL lies toward the back of the knee and it can tear whenever the joint improperly bends. For often people occur one episode of dislocation of the patella with no further recurrence. Surgery for curing this case, is not essential. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is a surgical method showed in patients with more severe patellar instability. MPFL is the major ligament which stabilizes the patella and helps in preventing patellar subluxation (partial dislocation) or dislocation. Paediatric surgery is a subspecialty of surgery including the surgery of fetuses, infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. This is a new procedure that helps the doctors attain more precision during surgery. GPS technology uses in this technique, similar to what you have in your car, and 3D computer images to help the surgeon and improve the accuracy of the surgery. Damages to the musculoskeletal system, such as fractured or dislocated bones, broken, and soft tissue injuries known as Trauma. Trauma Surgery is a subspecialty of orthopedic medicine that requires fellowship training beyond the usual orthopedic surgical residency. In this surgery, both knees are replaced at the same time. It’s relatively unusual to have the arthritis in both knees reach the same degree at the same time where a bilateral would be a consideration. Sports damages occur when engaging in sports or exercise. Sports damages have different causes such as overtraining, lack of conditioning, and improper form or technique. Failing to warm up increases the possibility of sports injuries. Hip arthroscopy (hip scope) is a surgical procedure to the viewing of the interior of the hip joint through an arthroscope (which inserted into the body through a small incision) and diagnose of hip pathology through a minimally invasive approach. Since 1990s, the advances in arthroscopic surgical equipment has allowed surgeons to treat problems that were untreatable or which required more open procedures. Hemi Hip replacement (Hemiarthroplasty): unlike THR During the hemiarthroplasty procedure the surgeon replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface. After surgery physical therapy begins as soon as the patient feels comfortable to restore function and movement to the joint. Most patients have positive results after this surgery. Hip resurfacing (Resurfacing of the hip joint) has been developed as an alternative form of THR. The concept of this surgery is an effort to save the bone during the replacement of an artificial hip joint. This preservation of bone has some advantages and choosing between THR and Hip replacement is very important decision that your doctor can make. The experience of surgeon with hip resurfacing is the most important; thus choosing the right surgeon is absolutely essential for a positive outcome. hip abnormalities or hip joint traumatic and relative problems are not restricted to adults. When a child has such problems the physical immaturity of their bones requires some special consideration which some surgeons cannot handle. In children surgery suggested when it is the only treatment to the joint. surgeons may use computer assisted surgery (CAS) technology, during hip surgeries to ensure implants are in proper places and aligned correctly which also may help the new joint feel more natural. This technology is an interactive system consisting of: 1. An infrared navigation camera 2. Smart Instruments with LED technology ۳٫ A computer with specialized surgical navigation software. A proximal hip replacement surgery, also known as hip arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure that aims to restore strength and function back in a disabled, or damaged, hip joint. Especially older athletes who have been highly active in their 20’s and 30’s athletes can experience hip pain, as a result of many circumstances: Hip pointer, Bone fractures, Muscle strains and tendinitis, Stress fractures, Muscle tendon bursitis, Contusion (bruise, commonly called a hip “pointer”), Hip labral tears, Osteoarthritis Sport hip injuries are usually identified via a detailed examination by a qualified sports-medicine physician. Diagnostic tests may include imaging techniques such as X-ray or MRI. The largest tendon in the body called Achilles tendon. It’s the tissue that connects your heel bone to your calf muscles and you use it when you walk or jump and run. While the Achilles tendon can endure great stresses from jumping and running, it is also vulnerable to injury. A “rupture of the tendon” is a separation and tearing of the tendon fibers thus the muscle can no longer perform its normal function. After an injury retrieval Achilles tendon function is critical. The goal to re-join the calf muscles with the heel bone to restore normal muscles activities. total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) also known as total ankle replacement is a surgery that use to treat ankle arthritis and replace the damaged surfaces of ankle joint with artificial implants. Ankle replacement mostly done when u are under general anesthesia. Your surgeon will make incision to expose joint. Then the doctor will remove damaged bone and replace with some metal and plastic parts. After surgery you need to stay in hospital at least for one night. It’s also known as ankle arthrodesis is usually done to treat arthritis in the ankle. Probably an ankle fracture is the most usual cause of arthritis of the ankle. If patients have severe ankle arthritis and more conventional methods have failed they can be candidates for an ankle arthrodesis. A fusion is a very good operation for treating a damaged joint for the ankle, especially when the patient is young and very active. Bunion or hallux valgus is an abnormal bony bump at the big toe caused by misalignment of the bone and soft tissues around the joint. In Bunion surgery, the operation is performed with very small incisions, only a few millimetres long. The aim of this surgery is to relieve pain and realign the soft tissues and bone which is the cause of the joint deformity. In foot and ankle surgery, minimally invasive refers to a type of surgery that has either a very small incision or no incision at all. Minimally invasive ankle surgeries have many advantages, including: Less injury, Less pain, Shorter surgery time. Some of these procedures include: ankle arthroscopy, fusions and gluing the joints together, for example the ankle joint and hindfoot joints. Ankle reconstruction surgery is performed to correct the structures of the ankle and restore its natural functionality that has been lost cause by injury or disease. This surgery is typically carried out as a day case procedure. general anaesthetic is given and an injection is used around the ankle so that it’s numb and it will be pain-free after the surgery. When a effective solution is required, a surgical ankle reconstruction can cure ankle instability quickly and effectively. Since the child is growing, Pediatric ankle disorders differ from those in adults. These conditions may be present at birth or develop later as the child grows which they can affect the way the child’s foot or ankle works. The most appropriate treatment for ankle disorders in children depends on the age of the child. In cases which surgery is needed to correct Pediatric ankle disorders, the aim is to maintain the optimum range of motion and function of the child. A bone can get fractured or broken completely or partially that may be usually caused from trauma due to fall, accidents or sports. In cases with severe fracture, stabilizing apparatuses such as plates or screws is necessary. In cases involving high impact injuries or bone reconstruction and repositioning surgeries, a trauma specialist is needed to provide optimum treatment. Soft tissue conditions happen due to trauma or overuse of muscles, tendons or ligaments. The cause of these injuries is mostly a sudden movement, although soft tissue injuries can also happen due to extreme overuse of fatigued parts which grow gradually, when a speicific activity is repeated over time. Arthroscopy is used to detect certain soft tissue conditions when the exact cause of ankle symptoms is unknown. The foot joints become unstable if the ligaments get damaged. Ligament injuries often happen due to sports injury. If a ligament is torn, the knee movement is limited significantly. Artificial ligaments are designed as surgical implants in the case of natural ligament loss or as a reinforcement structure. Using artificial ligaments has some noticable advantages in comparison to other methods. Artificial ligaments accelerate the bone healing and integration process. Limb lengthening surgery is used to replace missing bones and to lengthen or straighten bone structures which are deformed. This surgery can be performed for both children and adults. Through the limb lengthening process, new bone and soft tissues including skin, muscle, nerves, etc. will gradually grow. Some of the indications of this
 4 -7.71916 Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the "decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments." Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Eccentric contractions use less energy and actually absorb energy that will be used as heat or elastic recoil for the next movement. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Repeated-bout Effect markedly reduces DOMS. "Completing bouts of eccentric training and then repeating the workout 1 week (or more) later will result in less DOMS after the second workout." ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the 
 5 -8.16555  Those who have had this procedure done are expected to have a stronger ankle, meaning their ankle will no longer give out on them. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Success can be achieved regardless how soon the ankle is repaired after a patient's ankle instability issues occur, but the results are slightly better when the surgery is performed sooner. According to another study, most patients reported good to excellent results. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. However, patients may still experience temporary soreness in the ankle upon returning to sports or other physical activity. Swelling may also occur after exercise. In which case, doctors recommend continually icing even after full recovery from the procedure. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons.

[2024-06-13 06:47:56,382] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. Surgery, however, was associated with significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) for knee-related quality of life, daily function, and sports and recreation compared with conservative care. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Seen from the follow-up results of the 2000 patients, among the 2000 cases of badminton athletes, 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206.

Claim: Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows
Answer: 
2024-06-13 06:47:56 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. Surgery, however, was associated with significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) for knee-related quality of life, daily function, and sports and recreation compared with conservative care. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion. Surgical versus conservative management of acute patellar dislocation in children and adolescents: a systematic review. Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc 2016;24(3):760-767. Treatment of acute patellar dislocation. Am J Sports Med 1988;16(3):244-249. Patients with joint diseases, knee arthritis, and weight gain related joint problems can take advantage of high quality Orthopedic care services such as knee surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Orthopedic surgeons treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including: fractures and dislocations, torn ligaments, sprains, and strains, tendon injuries, pulled muscles, and bursitis, ruptured disks, sciatica, low back pain, and scoliosis, knock knees, bow legs, bunions, and hammer toes, arthritis and osteoporosis, one tumors, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, club foot and unequal leg length, abnormalities of the fingers and toes and growth abnormalities. The torn meniscus is repaired by a variety of minimally invasive techniques and requires postoperative protection to allow healing. but this type of surgery allows surgeons to use less cutting of the tissue surrounding the knee. This technique lets surgeon to see the knee joint without making a large incision through the skin and other soft tissues. A small incision is made at the knee joint so the surgeon may insert the arthroscope, a long, narrow tube-like instrument with a viewing eyepiece on one end, into the joint. If considerable damage is available within all three joint sections, a total knee replacement most likely will be recommended; however, if only one requires intervention, a partial knee replacement may be considered. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic. A meniscus tear is a most usual knee cartilage damage. The MCL faces inward toward the opposite knee. For often people occur one episode of dislocation of the patella with no further recurrence. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is a surgical method showed in patients with more severe patellar instability. MPFL is the major ligament which stabilizes the patella and helps in preventing patellar subluxation (partial dislocation) or dislocation. Hip arthroscopy (hip scope) is a surgical procedure to the viewing of the interior of the hip joint through an arthroscope (which inserted into the body through a small incision) and diagnose of hip pathology through a minimally invasive approach. Since 1990s, the advances in arthroscopic surgical equipment has allowed surgeons to treat problems that were untreatable or which required more open procedures. After surgery physical therapy begins as soon as the patient feels comfortable to restore function and movement to the joint. In children surgery suggested when it is the only treatment to the joint. Especially older athletes who have been highly active in their 20’s and 30’s athletes can experience hip pain, as a result of many circumstances: Hip pointer, Bone fractures, Muscle strains and tendinitis, Stress fractures, Muscle tendon bursitis, Contusion (bruise, commonly called a hip “pointer”), Hip labral tears, Osteoarthritis Sport hip injuries are usually identified via a detailed examination by a qualified sports-medicine physician. After an injury retrieval Achilles tendon function is critical. The goal to re-join the calf muscles with the heel bone to restore normal muscles activities. It’s also known as ankle arthrodesis is usually done to treat arthritis in the ankle. If patients have severe ankle arthritis and more conventional methods have failed they can be candidates for an ankle arthrodesis. A fusion is a very good operation for treating a damaged joint for the ankle, especially when the patient is young and very active. In foot and ankle surgery, minimally invasive refers to a type of surgery that has either a very small incision or no incision at all. Minimally invasive ankle surgeries have many advantages, including: Less injury, Less pain, Shorter surgery time. Some of these procedures include: ankle arthroscopy, fusions and gluing the joints together, for example the ankle joint and hindfoot joints. When a effective solution is required, a surgical ankle reconstruction can cure ankle instability quickly and effectively. Since the child is growing, Pediatric ankle disorders differ from those in adults. The most appropriate treatment for ankle disorders in children depends on the age of the child. In cases involving high impact injuries or bone reconstruction and repositioning surgeries, a trauma specialist is needed to provide optimum treatment. Arthroscopy is used to detect certain soft tissue conditions when the exact cause of ankle symptoms is unknown. If a ligament is torn, the knee movement is limited significantly. Artificial ligaments accelerate the bone healing and integration process. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. In which case, doctors recommend continually icing even after full recovery from the procedure. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons. Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the "decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments." Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the 

Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Seen from the follow-up results of the 2000 patients, among the 2000 cases of badminton athletes, 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206.

['Prince Harry joined forces with Sir Elton John on Tuesday to launch a new campaign aimed at tackling the spread of HIV among men.\nThe Duke of Sussex and the singer, who is a long-time AIDS activist, met with young men in London to discuss the issue and encourage them to get tested for the virus.\nThe new campaign, called "MenStar," is a joint initiative between the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Prince\'s Trust, and aims to encourage men to get tested for HIV and to seek support if they are living with the virus.\nDuring the launch, Harry and John spoke to a group of young men about the importance of getting tested for HIV, and the need to break down the stigma surrounding the disease.\n"The stigma that surrounds HIV is still a massive problem," Harry said. "It\'s one of the biggest barriers to getting people tested.\n"We\'ve got to change that. We\'ve got to make sure that people feel comfortable enough to go and get a test.\n"The earlier you get a test, the better the outcome. The earlier you know your status, the better the outcome.\n"We\'ve got to make sure that people know that they\'re not alone. They\'re not the only person in the world that\'s living with HIV.\n"There\'s so much support out there.

 We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS. But there is still discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS.
We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS, but discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is still rampant. Advances in research have made it possible to live with the disease, as people do with other chronic illnesses. But the greatest challenge for many people is still the stigma that accompanies the illness.
The burden of AIDS is much higher among African-Americans. Homophobia and fear of people with HIV/AIDS are particularly strong in the African-American community. These fears mean that many people are afraid to acknowledge their sexual orientation or HIV-positive status. For these reasons, many prefer to risk infection rather than face the stigma of HIV/AIDS.
Experts warn that "addictphobia" has contributed to discrimination against those who were infected with HIV through IV drug use. "Addictphobia" refers to negative beliefs and misconceptions about people who use illegal drugs. Among these false notions are the ideas that addiction is a moral failing and that addicts are unable or unwilling to change. These prejudices have slowed the availability of treatment centers for people who abuse drugs. As a result, people who are HIV-positive, African-American, and use IV drugs often face three stigmas. This heavy burden can increase isolation, anxiety, distress, and depression among those who are HIV-positive.
Educate yourself and others. Discrimination against people with HIV is often rooted in a lack of understanding about the virus and how it spreads. Contact your local public health department to find community-based organizations that provide HIV/AIDS information, counseling, and testing.
Know your rights. Federal law protects people with disabilities, including those with HIV infection, from discrimination. Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Housing Act protect your rights in the workplace, in housing, and in other settings. For example, the ADA requires employers to accommodate the needs of workers with disabilities such as HIV/AIDS as long as they can still do the required tasks of their job.
Become an advocate. One of the best ways to counter discrimination is to advocate for change in policies that prevent people with HIV from getting the care, housing, and respect they need.
Consider being open with those you can trust. You can choose whom to tell about your HIV status. Not all of your friends and loved ones have to know. You need to think about who can give you the support and comfort you deserve. Although it may be stressful to talk about, being able to confide in people you trust and getting the support you deserve will be an enormous relief. It's also good to remember that you can't control other people's prejudices; prepare for possible negative reactions, at least at first.
Seek support. Studies show that people with strong social support are less likely to feel stigmatized than those who are isolated. If you're uncomfortable seeking comfort from friends and family, contact your local public health department to find HIV support groups in your community. If you already have a close network, consider volunteering to give support to others with HIV.

  that Miln had rent boys on his books charging £200 each. Miln told the undercover reporter that senior church figures, Westminster MP's, civil servants, and members of the royal household were amongst the clientele for his services and the monthly orgies he held. According to the People, Miln tried to recruit the reporter as a rent boy and gave him an ecstasy tablet to help him relax. Laboratory tests later confirmed it was the drug. Miln also reportedly offered the journalist unprotected sex, telling him: "There is nothing better than dangerous sex. I could have HIV but at my age I don't care. If I then give it to someone it will be because of their stupidity." The Sunday People commented that it was a strange attitude from Archbishop Robert Runcie's

 For every person in Virginia with TB Disease, there are another 2,000 people living in Virginia with latent TB infection.
Heart disease is a leading cause of death for both men and women in Virginia. The most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD). A key part of Virginia’s Plan for Well-Being focuses on preventive actions that keep Virginians active and healthy, and the good news is that most heart disease and its complications are completely preventable by making healthy choices and knowing your risk factors.
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. If you have high blood pressure, manage it by going to your health care provider for regular visits, taking your prescribed medication, and monitoring your blood pressure at home.
One of the greatest concerns with heart disease, especially CAD, is having a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when a part of the heart muscle dies or gets damaged due to reduced blood supply. If you know the signs and symptoms of a heart attack you are more likely to survive.
If you or a loved one have any of these symptoms call 9-1-1 immediately and get to the hospital quickly. Making healthy lifestyle choices after a heart attack can reduce the risk of future heart attacks.
It is easy to keep your heart healthy, so this Valentine’s Day give your loved ones the gift of a healthy and happy heart!
January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month. Cervical cancer is a highly preventable and treatable cancer, thanks to improved screening and vaccination.
According to the US Preventive Services Task Force, cervical cancer screening should start at age 21. Screening can identify changes in the cells of the cervix that could lead to cancer. Screening might include a Pap test and, for some women, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV).
About one in four Americans are currently infected with HPV virus. HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer in women. The HPV vaccine is successful in protecting people from HPV related cancers. It is extremely important for boys and girls to receive the vaccine at age 11 or 12. The vaccine is the most effective when preteens receive the vaccine before exposure to HPV infection. The HPV vaccine is given in a series of two shots. For more information, refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s guide to HPV vaccines for preteens and teens.
Women aged 30-65 year should have a Pap test and an HPV test (known as “co-testing”) every 5 years (preferred). Although preferred, it is acceptable to have a Pap test every 3 years alone.
Immunocompromised women, women who have a history of cervical cancer and women aged 65 and older should consult with their physician for screening management.
As we head into the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to discuss our journey toward becoming the healthiest state in the nation, the challenges we faced this past year and how VDH will keep working for you in 2017.
A critical challenge that faced us before and during 2016, and we’ll continue to face in 2017, is one that affects all Virginians. In November 2016, I declared Virginia’s opioid addiction crisis a public health emergency. There’s still much we don’t know about this issue but there are steps everyone can take to protect themselves and their loved ones: Know the signs of addiction and where to get help. If you believe someone in your life is struggling with addiction, talk to them, consider obtaining the rescue medicine, naloxone, which is now available under a standing order I wrote and sent to all pharmacies in Virginia. In addition, take the REVIVE! course on how to recognize and respond to an opioid overdose emergency. Visit VaAware.com for more information on all aspects of this emergent problem. This is an issue that our entire nation will continue to face in the New Year. Please know that no matter the challenge, VDH will be here promoting well-being and protecting health.
Also in 2016, a new public health challenge came our way in the form of the Zika virus. Our early attention to the virus and the efforts of many different parts of our agency helped to ensure Virginia did not see a locally transmitted case of Zika in 2016. But like many health challenges we face, Zika will be an ongoing one. As we head into the colder months, be aware of the precautions to take before and after traveling to areas with Zika, especially if you are pregnant or are considering becoming pregnant. Stay tuned to our VDH webpage for more information as we approach mosquito season in 2017.
January is traditionally a time where we set goals for the New Year and focus on how to improve ourselves. I encourage you to take a look at Virginia’s Plan for Well-Being. The plan is a call to action for all of us to create and sustain conditions that support health and well-being. There are many simple things you can do to help Virginia become the healthiest state in the nation.
Here at VDH, we deliver 41 different services to Virginians every day, everything from vaccination clinics, outbreak investigations and family health services to emergency preparedness, HIV/STI testing, assuring clean drinking water in municipal waterworks and safe food in food service facilities. Throughout 2017, we’ll provide an inside look at some of the services that may not be as visible, but play an important role in keeping Virginia safe and healthy. Check back here often….
Finally, because we each have a role in protecting health and promoting well-being, I thank you for everything that YOU do to promote well-being and protect the health of all Virginians. On behalf of the VDH family, have a healthy and happy New Year.
The Holidays are a time we reflect on what we’re thankful for. The holidays are a great time of year to share fantastic meals and to spend time with your family and loved ones. While you prepare for the arrival of your loved ones or are traveling, follow these health and safety ideas for a wonderful holiday.
Wear your seatbelt every time you drive or ride in a car.
Make sure children are properly fitted in their car seat. It’s the best hug in the world.
Get vaccinations if you are traveling out of the country, you can check with your local health department for questions on travel vaccinations and clinics.
If you are traveling to an area with Zika, there are extra precautions you need to take.
Keeping your hands clean is a quick and easy way to keep from getting sick. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (hum the happy birthday song). If soap and water are not available use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Go on a walk when you’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.
Follow these Food Safety Tips for a Happy Holiday Season.
Whether you are staying close to home this year or traveling to see loved ones we wish you a happy and healthy Holiday.
National Influenza Vaccination Week (December 4-10) is a great time to make sure that you have had your flu shot this year and encourage your friends and family to get theirs.
Be familiar with the symptoms of flu and the people most at risk from flu complications, including young children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with certain medical conditions. If you fall into one of those groups, make sure you get vaccinated promptly, and treated promptly if you do get the flu.
Getting a flu shot every year is the single best way to prevent the flu. It not only protects your health, it protects the health of those around you. Everyone age 6 months and older should get a flu shot.
Even if you got a flu shot last year, it’s still important to get one this year. The flu vaccine is updated every year to provide protection from the flu viruses that are likely to be circulating and causing disease. Also, your body’s level of immunity from a vaccine received last year will have declined.
Using the vaccine locator to find a flu clinic near you.
Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that get touched a lot, such as door handles, countertops, and faucets.
Learn more about the Flu and how to care for you and your loved ones.
December 1 marks World AIDS Day. In Virginia, 24,853 people are living with HIV disease, 47% of whom have progressed to an AIDS-defining condition. This year’s theme is: “Leadership. Commitment. Impact.” We are now better equipped than ever to fight HIV and VDH leadership is committed to impacting the HIV epidemic in our state. Our mission is to make Virginia the healthiest state in the nation and to do that we must prevent new HIV infections and help those living with HIV get in care, stay in care, and live well.
The Virginia Department of Health recently released its Virginia Integrated HIV Services Plan, showcasing the goals, objectives, and activities to help stop the spread of HIV in our state and improve the health of all Virginians living with HIV. One component of the plan includes the promotion of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, (PrEP), a pill taken daily to prevent HIV. Another piece of the plan includes linking newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals into medical care sooner and keeping them in medical care—this will include promoting and assisting clients with enrollment into a health insurance plan and the development of new services to help people take their medication regularly. We will evaluate success of implementation of the Virginia Integrated HIV Services Plan on measures of the HIV Care Continuum. Achievement of viral suppression, or having a low viral load in the body, is the optimal health outcome for those living with HIV. In 2015, 42% of people living with HIV were virally suppressed, but through continued HIV prevention and treatment programs, collaboration, and connection with our communities, we can reach our goal of 80% by the year 2020.
We can all be leaders and make a commitment to stop HIV, not only this World AIDS Day, but every day. Get educated about HIV. Get tested for HIV. If you are HIV-positive, get in care and stay in care—talk to your doctor about how you can live a healthy and longer life. Find an event near you for World AIDS Day and remember those that we have lost in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Pledge to stand with us and help make Virginia the healthiest state in the nation!
As flu season kicks into high gear, there are things you can do to protect yourself and your family and help prevent the spread of flu in your community. The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot every year. Everyone age six months and older should get a flu shot. The flu mist is not recommended this year.
It’s important to remember: the flu shot cannot give you the flu. The most common side effect of the flu shot is soreness at the spot where the shot was given.
The flu virus spreads easily by coughing, sneezing or talking. You can also get the flu by touching a surface or object that has the flu virus on it, and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose. Symptoms of flu may include fever (though not everyone with flu will have a fever), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, fatigue (tiredness), chills, and sometimes diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually appear one to three days after exposure. If you do get sick, stay home from work or school so you don’t make others sick!
VDH monitors the level of activity of influenza-like illness (ILI) each week from October through May, and publishes a weekly influenza report.
Did you know you can help fight the flu in under one minute per week? By submitting a weekly health report to Flu Near You, you can help track the flu in your community. It’s simple and anonymous.
Wear reflective clothing or reflective tape, which can be easily added to costumes and bags for added visibility. Make sure cars are able to see you and your family when trick or treating.
If you’re throwing a party, practice these food safety tips for partygoers and party throwers.
Safe treats: Help your children identify treats that are safe to eat. Don’t let your children eat anything that isn’t commercially wrapped. Inspect treats for signs of tampering such as discoloration, tiny pinholes, or tears in wrappers. Throw away anything that looks suspicious.
Avoid using decorative contact lenses unless under the care of eye care professional. Obtaining contact lenses without a prescription or eye exam from an eye care professional can cause eye injuries including: abrasions, infections and blindness.
Review with your children how to call 9-1-1 if they ever have an emergency or become lost.
If you are using costume makeup for the first time, test it in a small area first to ensure it does not cause skin irritation.
If you are giving out treats this Halloween consider Non-Food Treats for children with food allergies.
VDH hopes you and your family enjoy a safe and happy Halloween.

 The theme "Know Your Status" for the 2018 World AIDS Day commemoration is of great significance. It emphasizes the importance of urging people to know their HIV infection status by getting tested. The theme was chosen to shed light on the fact that a significant number of individuals worldwide are living with HIV without even being aware of it. According to the UNAIDS data from 2017, about 9.4 million people were living with HIV but did not know their status. 

By promoting "Know Your Status," the campaign aims to encourage people to get tested for HIV. Testing helps in identifying individuals who are infected but unaware, allowing them to receive appropriate medical care and support. Additionally, when people know their status, they can take steps to protect their own health and prevent the transmission of the virus to others. Early diagnosis also enables timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which can significantly improve the quality and length of life for those living with HIV.

The significance of this theme is further highlighted by the fact that approximately 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017, and sadly, 940,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in the same year. Many of these individuals might not have been aware of their HIV infection or did not start treatment early enough.

Raising awareness about the importance of knowing one's HIV status is crucial in preventing new infections and reducing AIDS-related deaths. The theme serves to remind individuals about the risks associated with unprotected sexual relations, unsafe blood transfusions, and exposure to contaminated injecting equipment. It also highlights the possibility of mother-to-child transmission.

In summary, the theme "Know Your Status" for the 2018 World AIDS Day commemoration seeks to address the issue of individuals living with HIV but being unaware of their infection. By encouraging people to get tested, the campaign aims to facilitate early diagnosis, timely treatment, and prevention of further transmission, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and reduced HIV incidence.

 1 2.59168 We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS. But there is still discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS.
We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS, but discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is still rampant. Advances in research have made it possible to live with the disease, as people do with other chronic illnesses. But the greatest challenge for many people is still the stigma that accompanies the illness.
The burden of AIDS is much higher among African-Americans. Homophobia and fear of people with HIV/AIDS are particularly strong in the African-American community. These fears mean that many people are afraid to acknowledge their sexual orientation or HIV-positive status. For these reasons, many prefer to risk infection rather than face the stigma of HIV/AIDS.
Experts warn that "addictphobia" has contributed to discrimination against those who were infected with HIV through IV drug use. "Addictphobia" refers to negative beliefs and misconceptions about people who use illegal drugs. Among these false notions are the ideas that addiction is a moral failing and that addicts are unable or unwilling to change. These prejudices have slowed the availability of treatment centers for people who abuse drugs. As a result, people who are HIV-positive, African-American, and use IV drugs often face three stigmas. This heavy burden can increase isolation, anxiety, distress, and depression among those who are HIV-positive.
Educate yourself and others. Discrimination against people with HIV is often rooted in a lack of understanding about the virus and how it spreads. Contact your local public health department to find community-based organizations that provide HIV/AIDS information, counseling, and testing.
Know your rights. Federal law protects people with disabilities, including those with HIV infection, from discrimination. Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Housing Act protect your rights in the workplace, in housing, and in other settings. For example, the ADA requires employers to accommodate the needs of workers with disabilities such as HIV/AIDS as long as they can still do the required tasks of their job.
Become an advocate. One of the best ways to counter discrimination is to advocate for change in policies that prevent people with HIV from getting the care, housing, and respect they need.
Consider being open with those you can trust. You can choose whom to tell about your HIV status. Not all of your friends and loved ones have to know. You need to think about who can give you the support and comfort you deserve. Although it may be stressful to talk about, being able to confide in people you trust and getting the support you deserve will be an enormous relief. It's also good to remember that you can't control other people's prejudices; prepare for possible negative reactions, at least at first.
Seek support. Studies show that people with strong social support are less likely to feel stigmatized than those who are isolated. If you're uncomfortable seeking comfort from friends and family, contact your local public health department to find HIV support groups in your community. If you already have a close network, consider volunteering to give support to others with HIV.

But there is still discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS, but discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is still rampant. Advances in research have made it possible to live with the disease, as people do with other chronic illnesses. But the greatest challenge for many people is still the stigma that accompanies the illness. The burden of AIDS is much higher among African-Americans. These fears mean that many people are afraid to acknowledge their sexual orientation or HIV-positive status. For these reasons, many prefer to risk infection rather than face the stigma of HIV/AIDS. Experts warn that "addictphobia" has contributed to discrimination against those who were infected with HIV through IV drug use. Among these false notions are the ideas that addiction is a moral failing and that addicts are unable or unwilling to change. As a result, people who are HIV-positive, African-American, and use IV drugs often face three stigmas. This heavy burden can increase isolation, anxiety, distress, and depression among those who are HIV-positive. Discrimination against people with HIV is often rooted in a lack of understanding about the virus and how it spreads. Contact your local public health department to find community-based organizations that provide HIV/AIDS information, counseling, and testing. One of the best ways to counter discrimination is to advocate for change in policies that prevent people with HIV from getting the care, housing, and respect they need. Consider being open with those you can trust. You can choose whom to tell about your HIV status. You need to think about who can give you the support and comfort you deserve. If you already have a close network, consider volunteering to give support to others with HIV. The theme "Know Your Status" for the 2018 World AIDS Day commemoration is of great significance. It emphasizes the importance of urging people to know their HIV infection status by getting tested. The theme was chosen to shed light on the fact that a significant number of individuals worldwide are living with HIV without even being aware of it. According to the UNAIDS data from 2017, about 9.4 million people were living with HIV but did not know their status. By promoting "Know Your Status," the campaign aims to encourage people to get tested for HIV. Additionally, when people know their status, they can take steps to protect their own health and prevent the transmission of the virus to others. The significance of this theme is further highlighted by the fact that approximately 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017, and sadly, 940,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in the same year. Raising awareness about the importance of knowing one's HIV status is crucial in preventing new infections and reducing AIDS-related deaths. The theme serves to remind individuals about the risks associated with unprotected sexual relations, unsafe blood transfusions, and exposure to contaminated injecting equipment. It also highlights the possibility of mother-to-child transmission. By encouraging people to get tested, the campaign aims to facilitate early diagnosis, timely treatment, and prevention of further transmission, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and reduced HIV incidence. John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided contracting HIV. In 1986, he joined with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder to record the single "That's What Friends Are For", with profits donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad "Skyline Pigeon" at the funeral of Ryan White, a teenage haemophiliac he had befriended. John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and

For every person in Virginia with TB Disease, there are another 2,000 people living in Virginia with latent TB infection. The most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD). High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. One of the greatest concerns with heart disease, especially CAD, is having a heart attack. Making healthy lifestyle choices after a heart attack can reduce the risk of future heart attacks. Screening can identify changes in the cells of the cervix that could lead to cancer. Screening might include a Pap test and, for some women, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV). About one in four Americans are currently infected with HPV virus. The HPV vaccine is given in a series of two shots. Women aged 30-65 year should have a Pap test and an HPV test (known as “co-testing”) every 5 years (preferred). Although preferred, it is acceptable to have a Pap test every 3 years alone.

['Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2016, more than 800,000 people died by suicide, which equates to one person every 40 seconds.\n\nThe WHO\'s latest report, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, reveals that suicide rates have risen by 60% over the past 45 years. The report also highlights that suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds, and that it is preventable.\n\nThe report, which is the first of its kind to be published by the WHO, provides a global overview of suicide prevention efforts. It also highlights the need for countries to invest in suicide prevention strategies.\n\nThe report\'s lead author, Dr. Margaret Kruk, explains that "suicide is a major public health problem with devastating consequences for individuals, families, and communities." She adds that "the good news is that suicide is preventable."\n\nThe report recommends that countries should invest in a range of suicide prevention strategies, including:\n\n- Strengthening mental health services\n- Improving access to essential medicines\n- Implementing school-based programs\n- Developing crisis helplines\n- Providing training for primary care workers\n- Implementing media guidelines\n- Developing national suicide prevention strategies\n', 'Suicide kills one person every 40 seconds, says WHO.']

  usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Suicide attempts can be many times interpreted as a "cry for help" and attention, or to express despair and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years.

  for suicide. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not "plant" the idea or increase an individual's risk for suicide in any way. Epidemiological studies carried out in Europe suggest that, at this moment, roughly 8.5 percent of the world's population have a depressive disorder. No age group seems to be exempt from depression, and studies have found that depression appears in infants as young as 6 months old who have been separated from their mothers. Depressive disorder is frequent in primary care and general hospital

  Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, the United Nations (UN) health agency reported, estimating that it affects more than 300 million people worldwide – the majority of them women, young people and the elderly. An estimated 4.4 percent of the global population suffers from depression, according to a report released by the UN World Health Organization (WHO), which shows an 18 percent increase in the number of people living with depression between 2005 and 2015. Depression is a major mental-health cause of disease burden. Its consequences further lead to significant burden in public health, including a higher risk of dementia, premature mortality arising from physical disorders, and maternal

 This program is designed for any level employee to learn how to better recognize suicidal behavior, provide appropriate referral, and institute helpful prevention strategies.
Every 40 seconds someone in the world dies by suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative.
Associated risk factors for suicide include male gender, mental health and substance abuse, previous suicide attempts, financial loss, health-related occupation, age over 65, White, American Indian, and Alaska Native races, unemployed, living alone and/or social isolation, history of childhood trauma, chronic pain, family history of suicide, access to health care, ease of availability of means for suicide, and stigma against those who seek help for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). Poisoning, most frequently from medication overdose, is the leading method of non-fatal attempts and is associated with 52% of the hospitalizations related to suicide attempts.
Anti-anxiety agents, sedatives, hypnotics, pain relievers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are the most frequent medications associated with suicide. Anti-anxiety medications and hypnotics are associated with 53% and pain relievers such as opioids account for 40% of suicide attempts.
One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. Taken in total, multiple medications are often present in attempted suicide and mortality.
The US Veteran population is especially vulnerable with 10 to 30% diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Those with PTSD have higher rates of opioid use disorder (OUD). The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively.
Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. A survey of 165 college students with increased risk of suicide who had not sought professional treatment found that 66% of them believed that they did not require treatment.
Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own.
These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Additionally, suicidal individuals may not report needing care because they have a stigma associated with their symptoms.
Improved mental health literacy to identify when to seek care may be key to improving service use rates and patient outcomes. Research has shown that positive attitudes towards care, mental health literacy, peer training, family and friend support, prior service utilization, gatekeeper training, and screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors are helpful to improve recognition of at-risk individuals and referrals to appropriate treatment.
Suicide awareness and prevention strategies are a global imperative requiring all of us within our respective communities to identify and assist those individuals affected. This webinar is designed to teach participants to recognize risk factors and warning signs of suicide, recommend appropriate medical assistance, and promote preventive measures.
Why should you Attend: A larger percentage of our population suffers from mental illness and substance abuse which are major risk factors for suicide and self-injury.
Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable.
Suicide awareness and prevention training can provide key insight, help those at risk, and potentially save lives.

  Pakistan's suicide rate is below the worldwide average. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. Pakistan's death rate, as given by the World Bank, is 7.28 per 1000 people in 2016 (the lowest rate in the 2006-2018 period). In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths.

  There is a high stigma against mental illness. The Indonesian government currently uses 1% of its total health budget on mental health with only 48 mental hospitals and 269 psychiatric wards. The conditions of these places are unhygienic and overcrowded with inmates regularly shackled to prevent violence. Suicide is a problem in Indonesia and in 2018 ranks 65 with 2.9 suicides per 100,000. Suicides are often unreported due to stigma, approximately 10,000 people commit suicide per year.

  Studies have shown that the use of antidepressants is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25. This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment. According to the FDA, the heightened risk of suicidality occurs within the first one to two months of treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) places the excess risk in the "early stages of treatment". A meta-analysis suggests that the relationship between antidepressant use and suicidal behavior or thoughts is age-dependent. Compared with placebo, the use of antidepressants is associated with an increase in suicidal behavior or thoughts among those 25 or younger (OR=1.62). A review of RCTs and epidemiological studies by Healy and Whitaker found an increase of suicidal acts by a factor of 2.4. There is no effect or possibly a mild protective effect among those aged 25 to 64 (OR=0.79). Antidepressant treatment has a protective effect against suicidality among those aged 65 and over (OR=0.37).

 In 2016, SPCNY and OMH released 1700 Too Many: New York State’s Suicide Prevention Plan. This plan provides a detailed description of New York State’s strategy for suicide prevention. Compliance and field office staff help to carry out various activities. A few key projects and initiatives are described below.
New York State was the only state among three applicant organizations to receive a Zero Suicide grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) during the first cohort. This 5-year project was awarded in October 2017 to reduce suicide attempts and deaths by implementing Zero Suicide in health systems across all five mental health service regions in New York, and to create a Suicide Safer Care Network in Onondaga County by linking emergency departments, inpatient psychiatric units, outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment settings, and primary care practices across the county. Lessons learned at project sites will be disseminated statewide.
The New York State Office of Mental Health received a Nationa l Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2014 to reduce suicide in Western New York. As one of four states to receive this grant, New York implemented a pilot project to train medical and mental health providers to integrate suicide prevention strategies into their daily practice. Over the three years of this grant, 14,268 individuals were screened for suicide risk, over half of which screened at moderate- to high-risk. Individuals at moderate- to high-risk received assessment, safety planning interventions, and structured phone follow-up.
New York State received one of three Applied Research toward Zero Suicide Healthcare Systems grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to implement Zero Suicide in over 165 outpatient clinics serving more than 90,000 behavioral health patients. Since the inception of the project, more than 4,000 clinicians were trained in the Assess, Intervene, and Monitor for Suicide Prevention (AIM-SP) model of suicide safer care, more than 30,000 patients were screened, and more than 2,700 at-risk patients received a package of intensive, enhanced suicide-specific interventions. This is the largest implementation and evaluation of the Zero Suicide approach ever conducted in outpatient behavioral health.
The New York State Office of Mental Health partners with the Center for Practice Innovations at Columbia University to provide online suicide prevention training for behavioral health clinicians. These trainings include evidenced-based suicide risk screening, assessment, intervention, and monitoring. Materials from the trainings are made available through downloadable slides and resource pages at the end of each training. Training are available to all Office of Mental Health and Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services providers free of charge, and most carry CEUs for a range of mental health professions. Visit our Training Options page for more information.
The New York State Office of Mental Health partners with the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) on a variety of initiatives. The two agencies held the first ever Zero Suicide learning collaborative with outpatient substance use disorder treatment providers, informing the development of suicide safer care protocols being piloted in inpatient and outpatient treatment settings. A suicide prevention workgroup was formed within OASAS, representing prevention, treatment, and recovery. From this workgroup, multiple joint initiatives have formed including discussions of regulation revisions, cross consultation, promoting collaboration between suicide and substance use prevention coalitions, prevention on college and university campuses, training OASAS resource providers, and gambling and suicide risk.
SPCNY and the Office of Mental Health partnered with New York Sta te OASAS to develop guidelines, trainings, and resources for clinicians who have lost patients to suicide and/or drug overdose. The Traumatic Loss in the Workforce workgroup that formed out of this partnership has produced guidance documents, webinars for the mental health and substance use disorder workforces, and a train the trainer curriculum and program. More information about and access to these resources are available on the Suicide Loss of a Patient or Client page of the website.
SPCNY developed and delivered the first Suicide Prevention Coalition Academy to equip coalitions with the knowledge and skills they need to implement data-driven suicide prevention programs. Based on a pre- and post-test evaluation, there was a significant increase in the number of coalitions reporting current workplans; regular use of data to inform planning and action, mission, and vision statements; a consistent leader or facilitator; and a broad-based, multi-disciplinary group of attendees. Participants were also more likely to report having the tools to develop suicide prevention plans for their counties after they completed the Academy. SPCNY continues to offer coalitions and their partners new content through the Academy by collaborating with experts from across the state.
The current system for suicide death reporting is plagued by significant problems including misclassification, underreporting, a two-year reporting lag, and incomplete information on circumstances and upstream risk factors surrounding the death. SPCNY and the New York State Office of Mental Health are piloting a suicide fatality review process which includes the use of a comprehensive data collection tool by coroners and medical examiners during site investigations, and the convening of quarterly suicide fatality review team meetings to qualitatively discuss circumstances. Ultimately, this process will provide counties with data to inform suicide prevention efforts on the local level.
The New York State Suicide Prevention Council was formed in 2016 to assist SPCNY and the New York State Office of Mental Health Suicide Prevention Office to raise awareness, reduce suicide attempts and deaths, and promote wellness among New Yorkers. Membership includes experts (e.g., researchers, clinicians, and state and community agencies), individuals and family members with lived experience (e.g., attempt and loss survivors), and advocacy groups and organizations. Four workgroups have formed out of the Council including Zero Suicide in health and behavioral health care, communities and coalitions, school and youth initiatives, and data and surveillance.
New York State partners with Crisis Text Line so that New Yorkers in crisis have 24/7 access to trained counselors at their fingertips. Crisis Text Line is a texting service that allows individuals in crisis to be connected immediately with a trained counselor to text about suicidal thoughts and behaviors as well as depression, anxiety, substance use, relationship problems, and domestic violence, among other issues. New Yorkers can text Got5 to 741-741 to access this service. A marketing toolkit is available to promote Crisis Text and Got5.

 (WBTV) - In North Carolina, suicide is the second leading cause of death for children ages 10-17, according to a report from the North Carolina Institute Of Medicine and NC Child.
The report states that significant barriers remain for many who need access to mental health services.
“Thoughts of suicide and suicide attempts are more common among children who experience mental health issues like anxiety and depression. However, mental health is only one of a variety of factors that impact youth suicide,” the report reads.
The report points to things such as impulse control, and access to means of self-harm such as firearms and prescription drugs.
Risk factors mentioned in the report include stress, rejection, bullying, childhood abuse, trauma, social isolation and family violence or disruption.
According to the report, 16 percent of North Carolina high school students reported considering suicide in 2017.
“The influence of caring and well-trained adults, combined with evidence-based solutions that reduce family and community stressors, can prevent dangerous feelings of hopelessness in children and adolescents. Effective strategies include strengthening our crisis response system, increased investment in behavioral health systems, more partnerships between schools and behavioral health providers and screening more children and youth for mental health needs,” the report reads.
Atrium Health provides a crisis intervention helpline run by nurses and mental health professionals who will lend an ear and provide counsel, 24-hours a day, seven days a week.
The Atrium Health behavioral health call center number is 704-444-2400.

 1 3.80056 In 2016, SPCNY and OMH released 1700 Too Many: New York State’s Suicide Prevention Plan. This plan provides a detailed description of New York State’s strategy for suicide prevention. Compliance and field office staff help to carry out various activities. A few key projects and initiatives are described below.
New York State was the only state among three applicant organizations to receive a Zero Suicide grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) during the first cohort. This 5-year project was awarded in October 2017 to reduce suicide attempts and deaths by implementing Zero Suicide in health systems across all five mental health service regions in New York, and to create a Suicide Safer Care Network in Onondaga County by linking emergency departments, inpatient psychiatric units, outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment settings, and primary care practices across the county. Lessons learned at project sites will be disseminated statewide.
The New York State Office of Mental Health received a Nationa l Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2014 to reduce suicide in Western New York. As one of four states to receive this grant, New York implemented a pilot project to train medical and mental health providers to integrate suicide prevention strategies into their daily practice. Over the three years of this grant, 14,268 individuals were screened for suicide risk, over half of which screened at moderate- to high-risk. Individuals at moderate- to high-risk received assessment, safety planning interventions, and structured phone follow-up.
New York State received one of three Applied Research toward Zero Suicide Healthcare Systems grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to implement Zero Suicide in over 165 outpatient clinics serving more than 90,000 behavioral health patients. Since the inception of the project, more than 4,000 clinicians were trained in the Assess, Intervene, and Monitor for Suicide Prevention (AIM-SP) model of suicide safer care, more than 30,000 patients were screened, and more than 2,700 at-risk patients received a package of intensive, enhanced suicide-specific interventions. This is the largest implementation and evaluation of the Zero Suicide approach ever conducted in outpatient behavioral health.
The New York State Office of Mental Health partners with the Center for Practice Innovations at Columbia University to provide online suicide prevention training for behavioral health clinicians. These trainings include evidenced-based suicide risk screening, assessment, intervention, and monitoring. Materials from the trainings are made available through downloadable slides and resource pages at the end of each training. Training are available to all Office of Mental Health and Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services providers free of charge, and most carry CEUs for a range of mental health professions. Visit our Training Options page for more information.
The New York State Office of Mental Health partners with the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) on a variety of initiatives. The two agencies held the first ever Zero Suicide learning collaborative with outpatient substance use disorder treatment providers, informing the development of suicide safer care protocols being piloted in inpatient and outpatient treatment settings. A suicide prevention workgroup was formed within OASAS, representing prevention, treatment, and recovery. From this workgroup, multiple joint initiatives have formed including discussions of regulation revisions, cross consultation, promoting collaboration between suicide and substance use prevention coalitions, prevention on college and university campuses, training OASAS resource providers, and gambling and suicide risk.
SPCNY and the Office of Mental Health partnered with New York Sta te OASAS to develop guidelines, trainings, and resources for clinicians who have lost patients to suicide and/or drug overdose. The Traumatic Loss in the Workforce workgroup that formed out of this partnership has produced guidance documents, webinars for the mental health and substance use disorder workforces, and a train the trainer curriculum and program. More information about and access to these resources are available on the Suicide Loss of a Patient or Client page of the website.
SPCNY developed and delivered the first Suicide Prevention Coalition Academy to equip coalitions with the knowledge and skills they need to implement data-driven suicide prevention programs. Based on a pre- and post-test evaluation, there was a significant increase in the number of coalitions reporting current workplans; regular use of data to inform planning and action, mission, and vision statements; a consistent leader or facilitator; and a broad-based, multi-disciplinary group of attendees. Participants were also more likely to report having the tools to develop suicide prevention plans for their counties after they completed the Academy. SPCNY continues to offer coalitions and their partners new content through the Academy by collaborating with experts from across the state.
The current system for suicide death reporting is plagued by significant problems including misclassification, underreporting, a two-year reporting lag, and incomplete information on circumstances and upstream risk factors surrounding the death. SPCNY and the New York State Office of Mental Health are piloting a suicide fatality review process which includes the use of a comprehensive data collection tool by coroners and medical examiners during site investigations, and the convening of quarterly suicide fatality review team meetings to qualitatively discuss circumstances. Ultimately, this process will provide counties with data to inform suicide prevention efforts on the local level.
The New York State Suicide Prevention Council was formed in 2016 to assist SPCNY and the New York State Office of Mental Health Suicide Prevention Office to raise awareness, reduce suicide attempts and deaths, and promote wellness among New Yorkers. Membership includes experts (e.g., researchers, clinicians, and state and community agencies), individuals and family members with lived experience (e.g., attempt and loss survivors), and advocacy groups and organizations.

Every 40 seconds someone in the world dies by suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative.
Associated risk factors for suicide include male gender, mental health and substance abuse, previous suicide attempts, financial loss, health-related occupation, age over 65, White, American Indian, and Alaska Native races, unemployed, living alone and/or social isolation, history of childhood trauma, chronic pain, family history of suicide, access to health care, ease of availability of means for suicide, and stigma against those who seek help for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). Poisoning, most frequently from medication overdose, is the leading method of non-fatal attempts and is associated with 52% of the hospitalizations related to suicide attempts.
Anti-anxiety agents, sedatives, hypnotics, pain relievers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are the most frequent medications associated with suicide. Anti-anxiety medications and hypnotics are associated with 53% and pain relievers such as opioids account for 40% of suicide attempts.
One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. Taken in total, multiple medications are often present in attempted suicide and mortality.
The US Veteran population is especially vulnerable with 10 to 30% diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Those with PTSD have higher rates of opioid use disorder (OUD). The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively.
Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. A survey of 165 college students with increased risk of suicide who had not sought professional treatment found that 66% of them believed that they did not require treatment.
Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own.
These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Additionally, suicidal individuals may not report needing care because they have a stigma associated with their symptoms.
Improved mental health literacy to identify when to seek care may be key to improving service use rates and patient outcomes. Research has shown that positive attitudes towards care, mental health literacy, peer training, family and friend support, prior service utilization, gatekeeper training, and screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors are helpful to improve recognition of at-risk individuals and referrals to appropriate treatment.
Suicide awareness and prevention strategies are a global imperative requiring all of us within our respective communities to identify and assist those individuals affected. This webinar is designed to teach participants to recognize risk factors and warning signs of suicide, recommend appropriate medical assistance, and promote preventive measures.
Why should you Attend: A larger percentage of our population suffers from mental illness and substance abuse which are major risk factors for suicide and self-injury.
Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable.
Suicide awareness and prevention training can provide key insight, help those at risk, and potentially save lives.

 5 -9.61149  usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Suicide attempts can be many times interpreted as a "cry for help" and attention, or to express despair and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years.

['A drug used to prevent castration in bulls is being tested as a treatment for autism.\nThe drug, called leuprolide, is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. It works by blocking the production of testosterone in castrated bulls.\nIn a study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that leuprolide reduced the severity of autism symptoms in children.\nThe study involved 18 children between the ages of 5 and 17. The children were given either leuprolide or a placebo for 12 weeks.\nThe researchers found that the children who received leuprolide showed significant improvements in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behavior.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Daniel Geschwind, said that the results were "very encouraging."\n"We\'re excited about the potential of this drug to help children with autism," he said.\nThe researchers believe that leuprolide works by reducing the levels of testosterone in the brain. Testosterone has been linked to aggression and social behavior in both animals and humans.\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. Eric Courchesne, said that the results were "very promising."\n"This is the first time', 'Castration Drug Used as Autism Therapy']

  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in

  One of the central pillars of ENA theory is that fetal testosterone levels cause permanent changes in male brains that lead to increased criminality later in life. However, while individual studies have provided strong results on the effect size of fetal testosterone on aggressive or violent behavior, meta-analyses have remained less conclusive. A 2017 meta-analysis of fetal testosterone levels found that fetal testosterone levels (measured by the 2D:4D digit ratio) had only a small effect size of 0.036 on aggressive or violent behavior. The authors further concluded that "the 2D:4D digit ratio is neither strongly nor reliably related to aggressive or

  compared to control rats. Again BrdU was injected into both groups of rats in order to see if cells were multiplying in the living tissue. These results demonstrate how the organization of androgens has a positive effect on preadolescent hippocampal neurogenesis that may be linked with lower depression-like symptoms. Social isolation has a hindering effect in AHN whereas normal regulation of androgens increases AHN. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN.

  effect. This research demonstrates how androgens can increase AHN. Researchers also examined how mild exercise affected androgen synthesis which in turn causes AHN activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA induces a calcium flux that allows for synaptic plasticity which is crucial for AHN. Researchers injected both orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU to determine if the number of new cells was increased. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus. Again it was noted that AHN was not increase via activation of the estrogen receptors. Androgen regulation decreases the likelihood of depression in males. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like

  compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia. Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Moreover, estrogens had

All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms.

  In the US in the 2000s, companies and figures in the popular media have heavily marketed notions of "andropause" as something parallel to menopause; these notions have been rejected by the medical community. Additionally, advertising from drug companies selling testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as dietary supplement companies selling all kinds of "boosters" for aging men, have emphasized the "need" of middle-aged or ageing men for testosterone. There is a medical condition called late-onset hypogonadism; according to Thomas Perls and David J. Handelsman, writing in a 2015 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, it appears that this condition is overdiagnosed and overtreated. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, "sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales."

  females are underdiagnosed. Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism. Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:

Autistic disorder is a developmental disorder resulting in social, language, or sensorimotor deficits. Autism occurs in approximately one out of every 70 children. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Indications for developmental evaluation include no babbling, pointing, or use of other gestures by 12 months of age, no single words by 16 months of age, no two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months of age, and loss of previously learned language or social skills at any age. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Children with autism often suffer form mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Symptoms have a tendency to lessen with age. One out of four toddlers born prematurely have early signs of autism.
Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism.
Diet and autism, does food play a role?
Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Therefore, it would be a good idea to try a gluten free diet for a period of a few weeks to see if there is any response. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet.
Cochrane Database Syst Review. 2004.
It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. The one trial included reported results on four outcomes. Unsurprisingly in such a small-scale study, the results for three of these outcomes (cognitive skills, linguistic ability and motor ability) had wide confidence intervals that spanned the line of nil effect. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet.
There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. However, here are some possible options that I have come across that may or may not be helpful. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child.
I don't know enough about autism and the biochemical abnormalities to know whether serotonin is found too much, too little, or serotonin levels in autism are affected only in certain areas of the brain and whether supplements would help.
Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls.
Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. This study examines the whole blood concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in baseline conditions and during a challenge with L-5-OH-tryptophane (5-HTP; 4 mg/kg in non enteric-coated tablets), the precursor of 5-HT, in a study group of 18 male, post-pubertal, We found an increased synthesis of 5-HT from its precursor 5-HTP might be a one factor responsible for differences in the serotonergic system between autistic post-pubertal youngsters and normal controls.
Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose.
Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. After 8 weeks, children given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture.
My husband and I have a son who is a high-functioning autistic. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. We decided to try it and told our son we had something we thought might help his diabetes. Within a couple of weeks, he became much more talkative (he's a very quiet person and usually keeps his opinions to himself) and began voicing his political opinions. It was obvious he had put quite a bit of thought in them. Friends began noticing how much more he was talking with them and not immediately retreating to his room when they came to visit. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. So, thanks for pointing us in that direction.
What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? The child is just 2 years old.
Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. My best guess would be about a tenth of 500 mg capsule although I have no studies to support this dosage recommendation.
I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. He still takes it and the benefits remain.
Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. Childhood autism may be linked to a deficiency of fatty acids found in oily fish. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Autism rates in Scotland have risen dramatically in the past ten years, a trend mirrored across the developed world. In Scotland, an estimated 50,000 people, nearly 7,000 of them children, suffer from autism. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. "We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia," said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. Dr Bell compared cell membranes to a "brick wall" of fatty acids. Bricks fall out, but as long as they are replaced, then the wall holds strong. Problems occur when bricks fall out faster than they can be replaced. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish "bricks" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish.
Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study.
Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. We observed an advantage of omega-3 fatty acids compared with placebo for hyperactivity and stereotypy, each with a large effect size.
Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism.
Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 2001.
Phospholipid fatty acids are major structural components of neuronal cell membranes, which modulate membrane fluidity and hence function. Evidence from clinical and biochemical sources have indicated changes in the metabolism of fatty acids in several psychiatric disorders. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%).
I just wanted to let you know that kava has saved our family. We have a 17 year old son with autism. With puberty and the teenage years presenting challenges of size, rages and inability to control some emotional behaviors we were desperate. When we see our son beginning to become agitated we give him kava kava and he completely calms down and is able to focus and maintain at school, home and in the community. Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism.
A. Kava should not be used more than 2 days a week due to potential liver harm.
A multivitamin supplement may be considered.
Melatonin could be helpful for occasional use in case there is a sleep disorder.
The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below).
Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. Bacteria, fungi and yeast living in our bodies are important to health. They can affect the body�s susceptibility to infection, they can affect body weight and may even play a role in cancer. There�s also some evidence they play a role in mental health. "Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain." Children with autism tend to have abnormal and less-diverse communities of gut bacteria.
My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora.
Email November 2011 - A study came out last June which suggested that d-Ribose could be helpful for autism. My son tried it, and the results were remarkable: increased sociability, increased social cognition, mood stabilization, etc.
Pilot study of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement for children with autistic spectrum disorder.
J Altern Complement Med. 2004. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.
Determine the effect of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement on children with autistic spectrum disorder. Twenty children with autistic spectrum disorder, ages 3-8 years. A Global Impressions parental questionnaire found that the supplement group reported statistically significant improvements in sleep and gastrointestinal problems compared to the placebo group. An evaluation of vitamin B(6) levels prior to the study found that the autistic children had substantially elevated levels of B6 compared to a control group of typical children. Vitamin C levels were measured at the end of the study, and the placebo group had levels that were significantly below average for typical children, whereas the supplement group had near-average levels. The finding of high vitamin B6 levels is consistent with recent reports of low levels of pyridoxal-5-phosphate and low activity of pyridoxal kinase (i.e., pyridoxal is only poorly converted to pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the enzymatically active form). This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism.
Pediatrics. 2015. Core symptoms of autism improved after vitamin d supplementation. This report is one case study of a 3 year old boy who improved after vitamn D supplementation.
Dr. Beth L. Goodlin-Jones, of the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento, and her team report, "Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome." In a 4-week study, 18 children, ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, with autistic spectrum disorder and/or fragile X syndrome were given either 3 mg melatonin or placebo each night for 2 weeks. The children then "crossed over" to the other treatment group for 2 weeks. Reports from 12 children who completed the study showed that use of this natural hormone led to improvements in total night sleep durations, sleep latency times and sleep-onset times. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 2009.
Comments: For long term use, I suggest no more than 1 mg of melatonin a few nights a week. I am concerned that if parents give 3 mg nightly for many weeks or months tolerance could develop or side effects could occur. It is possible that even a third of a mg or half a mg could also be effective.
The main feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their names and often avoid looking at other people. They often have difficulty interpreting tone of voice or facial expressions and do not respond to others' emotions or watch other people's faces for cues about appropriate behavior. Another autism symptom is being unaware of others' feelings toward them and of the negative impact of their behavior on other people.
Sleep problems are reported in the vast majority of children with autism and fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is an inherited form of mental impairment resulting from a "fragile," or broken site, on the X chromosome. The syndrome affects 2 to 4 percent of those with autism spectrum disorder, and symptoms of autism are common in children with fragile X. Some people consider autism to be part of the obsessive compulsive disorder spectrum.
Those with autism rarely look people in the eye. While avoiding eye contact is often regarded as a sign of social or personal indifference, many people with autism say eye contact causes them discomfort or stress.
Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain. MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans show abnormalities in the structure of the brain, with significant differences within the cerebellum, including the size and number of Purkinje cells. In some families there appears to be a pattern of autism or related disabilities, which suggests there may be a genetic basis to the disorder, although at this time no one gene has been directly linked to autism. Men who become fathers in their 40s or older are much more likely to have autistic children than younger dads, bolstering evidence that genetics contributes to autism.
A 2015 study shows that women who take antidepressants in the later stages of pregnancy are more likely to have a child with autism. The study specifies one particular group of antidepressants in particular � the SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as Prozac, Zoloft or Paxil.
Disturbances in the serotonin system is another cause of autism, see study below.
Having a parent or a mother with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia increases a child's risk of having autism.
Low birth weight and preterm delivery are a cause. These children are more likely to exhibit autistic symptoms.
Advanced parental age appears to increase autism risk in children, and the risk is seen with both mothers and fathers.
Newborn babies who develop jaundice, a common liver problem that turns their skin and eyes yellow, are at greater risk. Pediatrics, 2010.
Expectant mothers suffering from asthma, allergies or a type of skin disease have a higher risk of giving birth to an autistic child. Asthma, allergies and psoriasis symptoms during pregnancy � especially if diagnosed in the second trimester � doubled the risk of autism in children compared to children who were not afflicted. Obese mothers are more likely to have autistic children.
Having a mother who lived within 1,000 feet of a freeway while pregnant doubles a child's odds, according to Southern California researcher Heather E. Volk, PhD, MPH.
Women who used prescription antidepressants of the SSRI type before or during pregnancy have an increased risk of having a child with this condition.
Women who have the flu while pregnant or have a fever lasting several days are more likely to have a child later diagnosed with this condition.
Children exposed to higher levels of traffic-related pollutants during pregnancy or during the first year of life are more likely.
Environmental pollutants, in addition to genetics, play a role in autism development.
Children whose mothers took certain asthma drugs during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of autism. The study, published online Jan. 6 2016 in Pediatrics, found a connection between autism risk and prenatal exposure to drugs called beta-agonists. They are most often used to control asthma, and include inhaled medications such as albuterol, salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil).
Children living in an area of New York state that uses aerial pesticides to control mosquitoes have a higher rate of autism than children in neighboring areas.
Exposure to antidepressant medications in the womb raises a child's risk of autism; July 19, 2017, BMJ, online.
Is it possible that children given too many vaccines could develop signs of autism?
There is a debate in the medical community regarding the role of vaccines in causing or precipitating autism. I am not sure at this time but I am not ruling out the possibility that there could be a link. Over the past two decades so many new vaccines have been added to a child's vaccination list that the medical community has little idea how all of these interact with each other and how they influence the immune system and neural tissue.
There does not appear to be a link between the season or month a child is born and the subsequent risk. There does not seem to be a link between mercury levels (as determined by analyzing hair samples for mercury) and the risk. I have not seen any evidence that autism is a result of toxins or toxic metals.
There are three large categories of autism treatment: Behavioral modification and communication approaches, dietary and nutritional approaches, complementary approaches. Despite anecdotal evidence suggesting that secretin is a useful treatment, the results of a new review do not support a therapeutic role for this gastrointestinal hormone.
Boys with autism have higher levels of growth hormones than other boys, which may explain why children with the condition often have larger heads. Boys with autism spectrum disorders are also heavier than boys without these conditions.
Tests on the brain tissue of 11 patients with autism who had died and spinal fluid from six living children with autism showed the activation of immune system responses. In a study published in the online edition of the Annals of Neurology, researchers said they found abnormal activity by immune system signaling chemicals called chemokines in the autistic patients. This ongoing inflammatory process was present in different areas of the brain and produced by cells known as microglia and astroglia.
We have an 8-year old son that has autism and we've been working with him for the last 4-years with therapy. We didn't see as big of a change in him until the last 3 months when we put him on a GFCF diet ( flucose free casein free ) and had a local allergy doctor, Dr. Baptist recommend a bunch of supplements and B-12 injections. He still has some behavior issues but his vocabulary has increased. Any opinions about chelation therapy? Does it work for Asperger syndrome?
We are glad your child has improved. I am not familiar with the use of chelation therapy for autism but I would be cautious.

 When Is Active Surveillance the Best Treatment for Prostate Cancer?
It is possible to interfere with the body's production of testosterone using medications that disrupt the process. The signal to produce testosterone originates in an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. At regular intervals, the hypothalamus secretes luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Luteinizing hormone signals specialized cells in the testicles (Leydig cells) to secrete testosterone into the bloodstream; follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sperm production.
When testosterone reaches the prostate, it is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)a more potent form of testosteroneby the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages.
Estrogen preparations. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period.
Because of these risks, men with a history of heart disease or thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation due to a blood clot) should not use estrogen therapy. In other men, these side effects can be minimized by using low doses of estrogen.
Taking an aspirin every other day also helps to lower the risk of heart attack and blood clots. Edema can be treated with diuretics (drugs that promote water loss through the urine). Other side effects include nausea and vomiting, breast enlargement, and ED.
With the approval of LHRH agonists, estrogens are no longer widely used. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. Researchers are also investigating the potential of an estrogen patch to lower testosterone levels without some of the side effects associated with other types of hormone therapy.
LHRH agonists. Also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, LHRH agonists are synthetic agents with chemical structures almost identical to natural LHRH. Initially, they behave like LHRH and stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland, which causes an increase in testosterone production. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The result is testosterone levels similar to those that occur after surgical castration or with estrogen. LHRH agonists are equivalent to surgical castration and estrogen in their ability to delay progression of cancer and prolong survival.
Commonly used LHRH agonists are goserelin (Zoladex), leuprolide (Eligard, Lupron), and triptorelin (Trelstar). LHRH agonists are traditionally given as injections monthly or up to several months depending on the dosage. Another option is an implanted drug delivery system (Viadur) that releases leuprolide continuously for one year.
The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. Some men experience irritation at the injection sites. LHRH agonists are less likely than estrogen to cause breast enlargement, nausea, vomiting, or cardiovascular problems.
LHRH antagonists. LHRH antagonists, also known as GnRH receptor antagonists, work by targeting and blocking luteinizing hormone receptors in the pituitary. This causes the testicles to decrease testosterone production.
The newest LHRH antagonist is degarelix (Firmagon), which was approved by the FDA in 2008 for use in men with advanced prostate cancer. The medication has been shown to begin working more quickly than the LHRH agonist leuprolide and to be equally effective at reducing testosterone levels. Another advantage of Firmagon over LHRH agonists is that it doesn't appear to cause a temporary surge in testosterone levels at the start of treatment.
The most common side effects are pain and swelling at the injection site, hot flashes, weight gain, and signs of liver abnormalities on lab tests. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped.
Anti-androgens. To stimulate prostate cells (both cancerous and noncancerous), testosterone must first bind to specific androgen receptors ("docking sites") on the cells. Drugs called anti-androgens can occupy these receptors, preventing testosterone from binding to them and stimulating the cells.
Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. Three anti-androgens are approved by the FDA to treat advanced prostate cancer: bicalutamide (Casodex), flutamide (available only as a generic), and nilutamide (Nilandron).
When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. In addition, anti-androgens can cause hot flashes, breast enlargement, diarrhea, and, in rare instances, liver damage. Men taking an anti-androgen must have their liver function tested a few months after starting treatment. Signs of liver problems include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and jaundice. Nilandron may slow the eyes' ability to adapt to darkness. This side effect lasts about four to six weeks.
In 40 to 75 percent of men taking an anti-androgen, PSA levels increase, indicating disease progression. If the medication is discontinued, PSA levels fall. Why this occurs is not clear. Possibly a mutation in the cancer cells causes them to respond to anti-androgen stimulation.
Total androgen blockade. The adrenal glands also produce small amounts of androgens, including testosterone. In an attempt to eliminate all androgen stimulation of cancer cells, some doctors use anti-androgens along with surgical or medical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression.
Despite promising preliminary findings, numerous studies have failed to demonstrate that total androgen blockade prolongs life any better than blocking testicular androgens alone. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone.
Similarly, the largest clinical trial to date of total androgen blockade found no survival advantage among men treated with total androgen blockade (orchiectomy plus flutamide) compared with those treated with orchiectomy alone.
Intermittent androgen suppression. In this approach, androgen is blocked chemically (using an LHRH agonist or gonadotropin- releasing hormone antagonist alone or in combination with an anti-androgen) until PSA levels fall. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. The rationale for this approach is the belief that hormone therapy encourages the growth of androgen-insensitive cancer cells (the cells that allow the tumor to continue to grow despite hormone therapy).
Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. Nonetheless, many oncologists routinely use this approach.
Other options. Testosterone levels can be reduced within 24 hours with the drug ketoconazole (Nizoral). The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression. Nizoral can also cause liver problems.

 2 0.99005 June 17 2017 by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Autistic disorder is a developmental disorder resulting in social, language, or sensorimotor deficits. Autism occurs in approximately one out of every 70 children. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Indications for developmental evaluation include no babbling, pointing, or use of other gestures by 12 months of age, no single words by 16 months of age, no two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months of age, and loss of previously learned language or social skills at any age. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Children with autism often suffer form mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Symptoms have a tendency to lessen with age. One out of four toddlers born prematurely have early signs of autism. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Diet and autism, does food play a role? Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Therefore, it would be a good idea to try a gluten free diet for a period of a few weeks to see if there is any response. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. Cochrane Database Syst Review. 2004. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. The one trial included reported results on four outcomes. Unsurprisingly in such a small-scale study, the results for three of these outcomes (cognitive skills, linguistic ability and motor ability) had wide confidence intervals that spanned the line of nil effect. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. However, here are some possible options that I have come across that may or may not be helpful. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. I don't know enough about autism and the biochemical abnormalities to know whether serotonin is found too much, too little, or serotonin levels in autism are affected only in certain areas of the brain and whether supplements would help. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. This study examines the whole blood concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in baseline conditions and during a challenge with L-5-OH-tryptophane (5-HTP; 4 mg/kg in non enteric-coated tablets), the precursor of 5-HT, in a study group of 18 male, post-pubertal, We found an increased synthesis of 5-HT from its precursor 5-HTP might be a one factor responsible for differences in the serotonergic system between autistic post-pubertal youngsters and normal controls. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. After 8 weeks, children given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. My husband and I have a son who is a high-functioning autistic. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. We decided to try it and told our son we had something we thought might help his diabetes. Within a couple of weeks, he became much more talkative (he's a very quiet person and usually keeps his opinions to himself) and began voicing his political opinions. It was obvious he had put quite a bit of thought in them. Friends began noticing how much more he was talking with them and not immediately retreating to his room when they came to visit. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. So, thanks for pointing us in that direction. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? The child is just 2 years old. Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. My best guess would be about a tenth of 500 mg capsule although I have no studies to support this dosage recommendation. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. He still takes it and the benefits remain. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. Childhood autism may be linked to a deficiency of fatty acids found in oily fish. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Autism rates in Scotland have risen dramatically in the past ten years, a trend mirrored across the developed world. In Scotland, an estimated 50,000 people, nearly 7,000 of them children, suffer from autism. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. "We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia," said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. Dr Bell compared cell membranes to a "brick wall" of fatty acids. Bricks fall out, but as long as they are replaced, then the wall holds strong. Problems occur when bricks fall out faster than they can be replaced. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish "bricks" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. We observed an advantage of omega-3 fatty acids compared with placebo for hyperactivity and stereotypy, each with a large effect size. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 2001. Phospholipid fatty acids are major structural components of neuronal cell membranes, which modulate membrane fluidity and hence function. Evidence from clinical and biochemical sources have indicated changes in the metabolism of fatty acids in several psychiatric disorders. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). I just wanted to let you know that kava has saved our family. We have a 17 year old son with autism. With puberty and the teenage years presenting challenges of size, rages and inability to control some emotional behaviors we were desperate. When we see our son beginning to become agitated we give him kava kava and he completely calms down and is able to focus and maintain at school, home and in the community. Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. A. Kava should not be used more than 2 days a week due to potential liver harm. A multivitamin supplement may be considered. Melatonin could be helpful for occasional use in case there is a sleep disorder. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. Bacteria, fungi and yeast living in our bodies are important to health. They can affect the body�s susceptibility to infection, they can affect body weight and may even play a role in cancer. There�s also some evidence they play a role in mental health. "Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain." Children with autism tend to have abnormal and less-diverse communities of gut bacteria. My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora. Email November 2011 - A study came out last June which suggested that d-Ribose could be helpful for autism. My son tried it, and the results were remarkable: increased sociability, increased social cognition, mood stabilization, etc. Pilot study of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement for children with autistic spectrum disorder.

 3 -7.64668  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in

Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Moreover, estrogens had 
 5 -9.13595  compared to control rats. Again BrdU was injected into both groups of rats in order to see if cells were multiplying in the living tissue. These results demonstrate how the organization of androgens has a positive effect on preadolescent hippocampal neurogenesis that may be linked with lower depression-like symptoms. Social isolation has a hindering effect in AHN whereas normal regulation of androgens increases AHN. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN.

Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. "We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia," said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish "bricks" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. "Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain." My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora.

Claim: Castration Drug Used as Autism Therapy
Answer: 
2024-06-13 06:49:07 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Luteinizing hormone signals specialized cells in the testicles (Leydig cells) to secrete testosterone into the bloodstream; follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sperm production. The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. LHRH antagonists. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped. Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN. compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia. Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Moreover, estrogens had

['Suzanne Somers, the actress and author, has become a leading advocate for a "natural" approach to treating menopause. She has written several books on the subject, including "Ageless: The Naked Truth About Beauty, Sex, and Success, Being Over 40" and "Sexy Forever: How to Fight Fat After Forty."\n\nSomers\' approach involves using bioidentical hormones, which are chemically identical to the hormones produced by the body. She believes that these hormones are safer and more effective than traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and other health problems.\n\nSomers has also been a vocal critic of the medical establishment\'s approach to menopause, which she believes is too focused on pharmaceutical solutions and not enough on natural remedies. She has called for more research into the benefits of bioidentical hormones and has been a leading voice in the movement to promote alternative approaches to menopause.\n\nIn addition to her advocacy work, Somers has also been a successful businesswoman, launching a line of beauty and wellness products under the name "Suzanne Somers Collection." She has also appeared in numerous television shows and movies, including "Three\'s Company" and "The Diary of Anne Frank."\n\nSomers\' approach to menopause has been met with both', 'Suzanne Somers advocates ‘natural’ approach when treating menopause']

  Janine O'Leary Cobb is a women's health activist and educator, and the author of one of the first popular books on menopause intended for a mainstream audience, Understanding Menopause (first published in 1988, now in its 6th edition, published 2005). Cobb is recognized widely as a pioneer in the women's health movement in North America and has won critical recognition for her work in the field. In 1984 she founded the popular health newsletter, A Friend Indeed, dedicated to highlighting the increasing medicalization of menopause, and to breaking the taboo of silence that still hung over many important women's health issues, such as menstruation, menopause and breast cancer. The publication continued to be released bi-monthly under the stewardship of other editors until 2006. Cobb was previously a professor with Vanier College, Montreal and is currently a Board member with Breast Cancer Action Montreal. She is also a contributor to Our Bodies, Ourselves, the groundbreaking women's health collective. She lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

  Growing up in the public eye was hard for Dean, and the constant media attention on her appearance (particularly her fluctuating weight) was especially tough. She says her self-confidence was damaged during this time, and this, as well as back pain, contributed to her decision to get a breast reduction in her teens. By her 30s she considered herself to be a lot more comfortable in her own skin, and far more relaxed about public interest than she used to be as a teenager, commenting: "I have stopped pleasing people – and I'm calmer and more self assured than I've ever been."

  axis is in balance, the less likely one is to develop age-related diseases. Conversely, early surgical menopause has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of these diseases. However, the most compelling supportive evidence is from studies of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Research with women and men undertaking HRT has shown that taking sex hormones that are biologically identical to human hormones delays the onset, decreases the incidence of, and can reverse the course of age related illnesses such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and some types of cancer. However, only biological hormones appear to have these effects. The use of

 Suzanne Somers has had a multifaceted career with several notable accomplishments. She is widely recognized as an American actress, author, singer, businesswoman, and health spokesperson. Somers gained fame for her roles as Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. 

In addition to her acting career, Somers has made significant contributions as an author. She has authored a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006). This book delves into the topic of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and offers insights into this specific approach to hormone therapy.

Furthermore, Somers has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and even a book of poetry, showcasing her diverse range of interests and talents. 

Throughout her career, Suzanne Somers has been a strong advocate for various health-related issues. However, her views on some medical subjects have faced criticism. She has faced scrutiny for her support of the Wiley Protocol, which is deemed "scientifically unproven and dangerous." Additionally, her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has drawn criticism from the American Cancer Society.

It is worth noting that while Somers has achieved success in her career, her ventures into health-related advocacy have been met with controversy. It is important for individuals to critically evaluate and seek reliable medical information from trusted sources before making decisions about their health.

Personal life
Born Suzanne Marie Mahoney in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California, Somers is the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Her mother, Marion Elizabeth (née Turner), was a medical secretary, and her father, Francis Mahoney, was a laborer and gardener. When Suzanne was six years old her father became an alcoholic. Somers's father would call her names and embarrass her.

Somers attended Capuchino High School She also said she was a cheerleader at Mercy High School in Burlingame, California, and was accepted at San Francisco College for Women, a college run by the Catholic Society of the Sacred Heart order. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. That marriage ended in 1968.

Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. They married in 1977.

Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa.

Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador.

On January 9, 2007, the Associated Press reported that a wildfire in Southern California had destroyed Somers' Malibu home.

Career

Early acting roles
Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the "Blonde in the white Thunderbird" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck (as the femme fatale) in the early 1970s. She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless "pool girl" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode "Cheshire Project,” she played a passenger on the first episode of The Love Boat as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time.  She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde "Chrissy Snow" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales.

Three's Company

 
Somers was cast in the ABC sitcom Three's Company in January 1977. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary.

The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley).

When Three's Company began its fifth season in late 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.
After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth episodes of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor.

In 1983, Suzanne Somers through her Hamel/Somers Productions had signed a deal with Columbia Pictures Television.

Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003.

Infomercials
Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame.

Playboy pictorials
Somers appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial.

Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster
During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs.  During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., "TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I.'s", The New York Times, January 3, 1983.</ref>

She's the Sheriff
At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons.

Step by Step
In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff.

In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season.

Candid cohost
From 1997–99, Somers cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her.

The Blonde in the Thunderbird

In summer 2005, Somers made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as "...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment") and told the New York Post: "These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq."Breaking Through
In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. 
Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter died.

The Suzanne Show
In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness.

Dancing with the Stars

On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Somers and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place.

Views on medical subjects
Somers supports bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Her book, Ageless, includes interviews with 16 practitioners of bioidentical hormone therapy, but gives extra discussion to one specific approach, the "Wiley Protocol". Somers and T. S. Wiley, the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is "scientifically unproven and dangerous" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine; its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners, which was the subject of an Associated Press article:
 "The problem, for many doctors: These custom-compounded products are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ... Somers, whose hormone regimen involves creams, injections and some 60 supplements daily, got a huge boost earlier this year from Oprah Winfrey. 'Many people write Suzanne off as a quackadoo' Winfrey said when Somers appeared on her show. 'But she just might be a pioneer.' ... Yet Winfrey's tacit support of Somers gave her some of the worst press of her career. 'Crazy Talk,' Newsweek headlined an article on the talk show host earlier this year. Another headline, on Salon.com: 'Oprah's Bad Medicine'."

In 2001, Somers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, and radiation, but declined to undergo chemotherapy. In November 2008,  Somers announced she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer by six doctors, but she learned a week later that she was misdiagnosed. During this time, she interviewed doctors about cancer treatments and these interviews became the basis of her book, Knockout, about alternative treatments to chemotherapy. In her book Knockout, Somers promotes alternative cancer treatments, for which she was criticized by the American Cancer Society:

 "The American Cancer Society is concerned. ... 'I am very afraid that people are going to listen to her message and follow what she says and be harmed by it', says Dr. Otis Brawley, the organization's chief medical officer. 'We use current treatments because they've been proven to prolong life. They've gone through a logical, scientific method of evaluation. I don't know if Suzanne Somers even knows there IS a logical, scientific method.' ... More broadly, Brawley is concerned that in the United States, celebrities or sports stars feel they can use their fame to dispense medical advice. 'There's a tendency to oversimplify medical messages.... Well, oversimplification can kill.'"

She is also opposed to water fluoridation. 

In January 2013, she suggested that Adam Lanza went on his shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School due to the level of toxins in his diet and the household cleaners he was exposed to. She stated that all these chemicals may "overelectrify the brain".

Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador.

On January 9, 2007, the Associated Press reported that a wildfire in Southern California had destroyed Somers' Malibu home.

Career

Early acting roles
Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the "Blonde in the white Thunderbird" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck (as the femme fatale) in the early 1970s. She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless "pool girl" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode "Cheshire Project,” she played a passenger on the first episode of The Love Boat as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time.  She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde "Chrissy Snow" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales.

Three's Company

 
Somers was cast in the ABC sitcom Three's Company in January 1977. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed Chrissy Snow, a stereotypical dumb blonde, who was employed as an office secretary.

The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley).

When Three's Company began its fifth season in late 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.
After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth episodes of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor.

In 1983, Suzanne Somers through her Hamel/Somers Productions had signed a deal with Columbia Pictures Television.

Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003.

Infomercials
Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame.

Playboy pictorials
Somers appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial.

Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster
During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs.  During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., "TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I.'s", The New York Times, January 3, 1983.</ref>

She's the Sheriff
At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons.

Step by Step
In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff.

In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season.

Candid cohost
From 1997–99, Somers cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her.

The Blonde in the Thunderbird

In summer 2005, Somers made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as "...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment") and told the New York Post: "These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq."Breaking Through
In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. 
Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star  Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter died.

The Suzanne Show
In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness.

Dancing with the Stars

On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Somers and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place.

Views on medical subjects
Somers supports bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Her book, Ageless, includes interviews with 16 practitioners of bioidentical hormone therapy, but gives extra discussion to one specific approach, the "Wiley Protocol". Somers and T. S. Wiley, the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is "scientifically unproven and dangerous" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine; its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners, which was the subject of an Associated Press article:
 "The problem, for many doctors: These custom-compounded products are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ... Somers, whose hormone regimen involves creams, injections and some 60 supplements daily, got a huge boost earlier this year from Oprah Winfrey. 'Many people write Suzanne off as a quackadoo' Winfrey said when Somers appeared on her show. 'But she just might be a pioneer.' ... Yet Winfrey's tacit support of Somers gave her some of the worst press of her career. 'Crazy Talk,' Newsweek headlined an article on the talk show host earlier this year. Another headline, on Salon.com: 'Oprah's Bad Medicine'."

In 2001, Somers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, and radiation, but declined to undergo chemotherapy. In November 2008,  Somers announced she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer by six doctors, but she learned a week later that she was misdiagnosed. During this time, she interviewed doctors about cancer treatments and these interviews became the basis of her book, Knockout, about alternative treatments to chemotherapy. In her book Knockout, Somers promotes alternative cancer treatments, for which she was criticized by the American Cancer Society:

 "The American Cancer Society is concerned. ... 'I am very afraid that people are going to listen to her message and follow what she says and be harmed by it', says Dr. Otis Brawley, the organization's chief medical officer. 'We use current treatments because they've been proven to prolong life. They've gone through a logical, scientific method of evaluation. I don't know if Suzanne Somers even knows there IS a logical, scientific method.' ... More broadly, Brawley is concerned that in the United States, celebrities or sports stars feel they can use their fame to dispense medical advice. 'There's a tendency to oversimplify medical messages.... Well, oversimplification can kill.'"

She is also opposed to water fluoridation. 

In January 2013, she suggested that Adam Lanza went on his shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School due to the level of toxins in his diet and the household cleaners he was exposed to. She stated that all these chemicals may "overelectrify the brain".

Playboy pictorials Somers appeared in two Playboy cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs. During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., "TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I.'s", The New York Times, January 3, 1983.</ref> She's the Sheriff At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom She's the Sheriff, which ran in first-run syndication. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons. Step by Step In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for ABC. Her roles in these, including the movie Rich Men, Single Women, attracted the attention of Lorimar Television and Miller-Boyett Productions, who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with Heather Locklear, who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on Going Places (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced She's the Sheriff. In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom Step By Step (with Patrick Duffy), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented TGIF lineup. A week after the premiere of Step By Step, a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled Keeping Secrets (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. Step By Step continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of Candid Camera with Peter Funt, which began airing later that season. Candid cohost From 1997–99, Somers cohosted the revised Candid Camera show, when CBS chose to bring it back with Peter Funt. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her. The Blonde in the Thunderbird In summer 2005, Somers made her Broadway debut in a one-woman show, The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales. She blamed the harsh reviews (The New York Times referred to it as "...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment") and told the New York Post: "These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them. I was lying there naked, and they decided to kick me and step on me, just like these visions you see in Iraq."Breaking Through In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom. Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former Three's Company co-star Joyce DeWitt; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter died. The Suzanne Show In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the Lifetime Network. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness. Dancing with the Stars On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars. Her partner was professional dancer Tony Dovolani. Somers and Dovolani were eliminated on the fifth week of competition and finished in 9th place. Views on medical subjects Somers supports bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Her book, Ageless, includes interviews with 16 practitioners of bioidentical hormone therapy, but gives extra discussion to one specific approach, the "Wiley Protocol". Somers and T. S. Wiley, the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is "scientifically unproven and dangerous" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine; its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners, which was

  reductase inhibitor, and can reduce cholesterol production. As with statins, this decrease in intra-hepatic (liver) LDL levels may induce hepatic LDL receptor up-regulation, also decreasing plasma LDL levels. As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. ; Phytosterols are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy, although no scientifically proven beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or overall mortality exists. Current supplemental guidelines for reducing LDL recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15 gram per day.

 PCSK9 inhibitors, in clinical trials, by several companies, are more effective for LDL reduction than the statins, including statins alone at high dose (though not necessarily the combination of statins plus ezetimibe). ; Statins reduce high levels of LDL particles by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in cells, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several

 Adding the 'investigational biologic' evolocumab to statin therapy works better, study says.
Adding evolocumab to a traditional cholesterol-lowering drug treatment could lower your risk of cardiovascular events by 50 percent.
Adding an experimental new biologic drug to conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in better cholesterol control and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke, according to a new study.
Compared to patients on conventional therapy alone, those who also got the experimental drug evolocumab were half as likely to die, suffer a heart attack or a stroke or be in the hospital to have a procedure to open blocked arteries during the one-year follow-up, said lead researcher Dr. Marc Sabatine.
The combined therapy ''basically halves the rate of cardiovascular events," said Sabatine, a senior physician in cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
"It's a very impressive risk reduction," added Sabatine, who's due to present the study findings Sunday at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in San Diego. The findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen.
Sabatine's group looked at 4,465 patients who had already completed one of the 12 phase II or III trials to evaluate the drug. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The evolocumab was injected under the skin either every two or four weeks.
The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained.
"This is a new class of drugs. They are being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration now, but they are not available yet," Sabatine said.
The new drug isn't meant to replace statins, Sabatine said. "Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. These [new drugs] will be an additional medicine for patients who aren't getting appropriate control of their cholesterol on a statin alone," he said.
Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up. While 2.18 percent of those in the standard treatment group had a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problem, less than 1 percent of those in the combination group did, the findings showed. Over the follow-up, there were 60 heart attacks, strokes or other such events.
Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. Some experts advise those at high risk keep their LDL cholesterol lower than 70, Sabatine said.
The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, "have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He reviewed the study findings.
Based on the studies so far, Fonarow said, experts expect that the drug will help reduce both fatal and non-fatal heart attacks and strokes.
However, he offered a caveat about the new study. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. And, the total number of "events" (heart attack and strokes and procedures) was only 60.
"As such, it will be very important to await the findings from the prospective large-scale clinical trials that are evaluating the impact of these agents on cardiovascular events along with their safety," Fonarow said.
An ongoing study of more than 27,000 patients will provide more information, Sabatine said. The results from that trial aren't expected until 2017. However, the drug may become available for clinical use before that, pending FDA review, he said.
The expected cost of the new drug isn't known, but biologics are expensive, with some costing $50,000 a year or more. Statins, the standard therapy, are inexpensive, as many are available now in generic form.
A second preliminary study to be presented Sunday at the cardiology meeting found that another experimental drug, alirocumab, also lowered levels of LDL cholesterol when combined with statin therapy. Another monoclonal antibody, the drug led to fewer heart attacks, strokes and deaths during a 78-week trial, researchers said.
The results of this trial were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

  how much lower. This low level of less than 70 mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of

  In the US, the American Heart Association, NIH, and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting LDL-Cholesterol levels, estimated or measured, and risk for heart disease. As of about 2005, these guidelines were: Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large double blind, randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia; far more effective than coronary angioplasty/stenting or bypass surgery. For instance, for people with known atherosclerosis diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70 mg/dL,

 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 27,564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg per deciliter.
Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing "bad" LDL cholesterol.
In the new study, patients with heart disease who combined Repatha with a statin, the most commonly used cholesterol medication, decreased their LDL from 92 milligrams per deciliter to 30.
Some doctors hailed the results as major progress against heart disease.
A year and a half after its feted approval, a new cholesterol drug has passed a key test.
In addition, high-risk populations appear the most relevant for delivering benefit from PCSK9 drugs, Meanwell said.
The company hinted at price flexibility when evolocumab launched, and already uses payment schemes that link the drug's net price to cholesterol reductions and "anticipated appropriate patient utilization".
Overall, the risk reduction was less than what might have been expected based on how much evolocumab reduces the amount of LDL cholesterol in the body, says Krumholz.
A landmark study revealed that the cholesterol-lowering drug evolocumab (Repatha) also reduces the risk of death and hospitalization.
Last May it was made available on the NHS for 325,000 people at high risk.
Those benefits are clinically significant, not just statistically significant, and in a conference call hosted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc.'s senior biotech analyst Salim Syed, James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School and president-elect of the national lipid association, stressed the good news about the results. "There are an very bad lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down".
A new class of cholesterol lowering drugs, PCSK9 inhibitors, effectively lower LDL cholesterol levels beyond current treatment targets and new research showed that these lower levels result in a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events, making these drugs attractive treatment options for patients who do not achieve their target cholesterol level with statin therapy alone. It was also published online today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Almost all were taking modest or large doses of statins. Most patients (81 percent) had a history of heart attack, 19 percent had suffered an ischemic stroke, which happens when a blood clot blocks an artery supplying blood to the brain, and 13 percent had symptomatic peripheral artery disease, which is when blood flow to the limbs is limited.
"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine". That longer duration in between doses means a clean side effect profile is crucial because the effects couldn't be reversed if there was a problem.
Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood, called PCSK9.
"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres". A year-long supply of evolocumab costs $14,100, while alirocumab goes for $14,600.
Perry Colangeli, a 51-year-old from Calgary has been taking evolocumab as part of the study.
"With this trial, we now have definitive data that by adding evolocumab to a background of statin therapy, we can significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes and do so safely", said Marc S. Sabatine, MD, the Lewis Dexter, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, chair of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group and the study's lead author.

  The mevalonate pathway serves as the basis for the biosynthesis of many molecules, including cholesterol. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) is an essential component and performs the first of 37 steps within the cholesterol production pathway, and is present in every animal cell. LDL-C is not a measurement of actual LDL particles. LDL-C is only an estimate (not measured from the individual's blood sample) of how much cholesterol is being transported by all LDL particles, which is either a smaller concentration of large particles or a high concentration of small particles. LDL particles carry many fat molecules (typically 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per LDL particle); this includes cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and others. Thus even if the hundreds to thousands of cholesterol molecules within an average LDL particle were measured, this does not reflect the other fat molecules or even the number of LDL particles.

 March 26, 2012 (Chicago) -- An experimental biologic drug called REGN727 may help lower levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol when a statin drug isn't enough, researchers report.
In a new study, REGN727 (which does not have a brand name yet) cut LDL cholesterol by up to 72% when given in addition to the statin Lipitor.
That study, presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting, included about 180 people with LDL cholesterol levels of at least 100 mg/dL. For 12 weeks, they took Lipitor and got injections of REGN727 or a placebo.
In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. And in people who got 100 milligrams every two weeks, LDL levels fell by 64%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%.
In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo.
The researchers also tested two once-monthly doses of the drug, but they didn't work as well as the every-two-weeks injections, says study head James McKenney, PharmD, chief executive officer of National Clinical Research in Richmond, Va.
"This is a 'wow' study," says Rick Nishimura, MD, a heart specialist at the Mayo Clinic, who was head of the committee that chose which studies to highlight at the meeting. "It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future," he tells WebMD. Nishimura was not involved with the study.
The new drug works differently than statins do. It inhibits a protein called PCSK9. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.
Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone.
About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says.
In the new study, REGN727 was generally safe, with mild infections and redness and soreness where the injection was given being the most common side effects. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. Six people taking the drug stopped treatment due to side effects.
Another anti-PCSK9 drug -- currently called AMG 145 -- is also in development and, in an early study, lowered LDL levels when given in addition to a statin. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins.
Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD.
REGN727 and AMG 145 are both scheduled for larger, longer studies.
The big question is whether the gains in LDL cholesterol will translate into fewer heart attacks, strokes, and deaths, Gibbons says.
This REGN727 study was funded by Sanofi U.S. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which make the drug. McKenney's company has received research funding from the companies. The AMG 145 study was presented by Amgen, the drug's maker.

Adding evolocumab to a traditional cholesterol-lowering drug treatment could lower your risk of cardiovascular events by 50 percent.

The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen.
Sabatine's group looked at 4,465 patients who had already completed one of the 12 phase II or III trials to evaluate the drug. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The evolocumab was injected under the skin either every two or four weeks.
The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained.
"This is a new class of drugs. They are being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration now, but they are not available yet," Sabatine said.
The new drug isn't meant to replace statins, Sabatine said. "Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. These [new drugs] will be an additional medicine for patients who aren't getting appropriate control of their cholesterol on a statin alone," he said.
Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up.

Over the follow-up, there were 60 heart attacks, strokes or other such events.
Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. Some experts advise those at high risk keep their LDL cholesterol lower than 70, Sabatine said.

Based on the studies so far, Fonarow said, experts expect that the drug will help reduce both fatal and non-fatal heart attacks and strokes.
However, he offered a caveat about the new study. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. And, the total number of "events" (heart attack and strokes and procedures) was only 60.
"As such, it will be very important to await the findings from the prospective large-scale clinical trials that are evaluating the impact of these agents on cardiovascular events along with their safety," Fonarow said.
An ongoing study of more than 27,000 patients will provide more information, Sabatine said. The results from that trial aren't expected until 2017. However, the drug may become available for clinical use before that, pending FDA review, he said.
The expected cost of the new drug isn't known, but biologics are expensive, with some costing $50,000 a year or more. Statins, the standard therapy, are inexpensive, as many are available now in generic form.

"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine". That longer duration in between doses means a clean side effect profile is crucial because the effects couldn't be reversed if there was a problem.
Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood, called PCSK9.
"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres". A year-long supply of evolocumab costs $14,100, while alirocumab goes for $14,600.
Perry Colangeli, a 51-year-old from Calgary has been taking evolocumab as part of the study.
"With this trial, we now have definitive data that by adding evolocumab to a background of statin therapy, we can significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes and do so safely", said Marc S. Sabatine, MD, the Lewis Dexter, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, chair of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group and the study's lead author.

This low level of less than 70 mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.

In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. "It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future," he tells WebMD.

While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins.

"This is a new class of drugs. "Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up. Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, "have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. A second preliminary study to be presented Sunday at the cardiology meeting found that another experimental drug, alirocumab, also lowered levels of LDL cholesterol when combined with statin therapy.

The patient reported that he had ingested a few drops of Visine brand eye drops in an attempt to alleviate a headache. The patient had no history of gastrointestinal disease or recent changes in diet.\n\nUpon examination, the patient was found to have watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and dehydration. Laboratory tests revealed no significant abnormalities, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count.\n\nThe patient was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and was discharged after 24 hours with instructions to follow up with a primary care physician. The patient was advised to avoid ingesting eye drops in the future, and to seek medical attention if symptoms persisted or worsened.\n\nThe mechanism of action for this adverse effect is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to the presence of tetrahydrozoline, a vasoconstrictor commonly found in eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline can cause gastrointestinal symptoms when ingested, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of proper labeling and instructions for over-the-counter medications, as well as the potential for unintended', 'A few drops of Visine brand eye drops taken internally will induce uncontrollable diarrhea.']

 Visine  is a brand of eye drops produced by Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson acquired Visine, along with Pfizer's entire consumer healthcare portfolio, in December 2006. In some countries it is called Vispring.

Visine Original
The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels.

Administration

Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily .

Adverse effects

Those using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application.
Use of this product can cause a rebound effect causing the redness to worsen. Prolonged use can cause blood vessels to be dilated for an extended period of time. Use should be limited unless specified by a doctor.
A red eye may often be indicative of more serious underlying ocular condition; simply reducing blood flow to the area won't solve the condition and may even exacerbate symptoms.
These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye.
Visine is not to be used by patients with glaucoma since the production of more liquids only contributes to the problem of high pressure within the eye.

Side effects
A common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of explosive diarrhea, akin to that of a laxative. This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as:

Dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia)
Blurred vision
Nausea and vomiting (as opposed to explosive diarrhea)
Difficulty in breathing or even a complete halt in breathing
Elevating (hypertension) then dropping (hypotension) blood pressure
Possible coma
Seizures and tremors
Death

Anyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately. Ingesting Visine was shown to be lethal in the case of Lana Clayton, who killed her husband by administering Visine to his drinks over a period of three days in July 2018.

Varieties
Visine is formulated in several varieties:

VISINE A.C. - Astringent/Redness Reliever Eye Drops (Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%)
Special formula for allergens, such as ragweed, dust, or pollen.

VISINE FOR CONTACTS - For Silicone Hydrogel and Hydrophilic lenses
Used primarily for comfort during the day, moistening upon awakening and before sleep.

VISINE L.R.  (Oxymetazoline HCI 0.025%)
A longer-lasting formula that lasts for up to 6 hours.

VISINE TEARS (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.2%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1% - Used AS NEEDED)
 See artificial tears.

VISINE-A (Formerly OCUHIST) (Naphazoline/pheniramine)
Antihistamine combined with a vasoconstrictor for itchy eyes associated with allergy.
VISINE MAXIMUM (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.36%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1.0%, Tetrahydrozoline HCI 0.05%)
 Includes HYDROBLEND®, which acts as a moisturizer. Lasts up to 10 hours.
VISINE TOTALITY (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.36%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1.0%, Tetrahydrozoline HCI 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%)
Multi-Symptom Relief.  Lubricant / Astrigent Redness Reliever Eye Drops  (Relief for: red, burning, watery, itchy, gritty, dry, irritated eyes.)

Popular culture
The effect of Visine causing upset gastrointestinal effects when being ingested is depicted in the movie Wedding Crashers, where John Beckwith (portrayed by Owen Wilson) poisons Sack's (Bradley Cooper) drink, causing him to suffer all night. John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times over the course of the film to fake crying. This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.

The urban legend about Visine's explosive diarrhea-inducing capacity is also perpetuated in the movie version of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell. In the movie, the main character Tucker Max (played by Matt Czuchry), is making fun of two women at the bar, in which one of them squirts Visine into his beer bottle. This leads to Tucker and an allegedly married woman he leaves the bar with to both have extreme explosive diarrhea.

In season 4, episode 3 of Orange Is the New Black, an inmate poisons a fellow inmate using Visine; the poisoned inmate immediately experiences explosive diarrhea.

Special formula for allergens, such as ragweed, dust, or pollen.

VISINE FOR CONTACTS - For Silicone Hydrogel and Hydrophilic lenses
Used primarily for comfort during the day, moistening upon awakening and before sleep.

VISINE L.R.  (Oxymetazoline HCI 0.025%)
A longer-lasting formula that lasts for up to 6 hours.

VISINE TEARS (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.2%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1% - Used AS NEEDED)
 See artificial tears.

VISINE-A (Formerly OCUHIST) (Naphazoline/pheniramine)
Antihistamine combined with a vasoconstrictor for itchy eyes associated with allergy.
VISINE MAXIMUM (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.36%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1.0%, Tetrahydrozoline HCI 0.05%)
 Includes HYDROBLEND®, which acts as a moisturizer. Lasts up to 10 hours.
VISINE TOTALITY (Glycerin 0.2%, Hypromellose 0.36%, Polyethylene glycol 400 1.0%, Tetrahydrozoline HCI 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%)
Multi-Symptom Relief.  Lubricant / Astrigent Redness Reliever Eye Drops  (Relief for: red, burning, watery, itchy, gritty, dry, irritated eyes.)

Popular culture
The effect of Visine causing upset gastrointestinal effects when being ingested is depicted in the movie Wedding Crashers, where John Beckwith (portrayed by Owen Wilson) poisons Sack's (Bradley Cooper) drink, causing him to suffer all night. John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times over the course of the film to fake crying. This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.

The urban legend about Visine's explosive diarrhea-inducing capacity is also perpetuated in the movie version of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell. In the movie, the main character Tucker Max (played by Matt Czuchry), is making fun of two women at the bar, in which one of them squirts Visine into his beer bottle. This leads to Tucker and an allegedly married woman he leaves the bar with to both have extreme explosive diarrhea.

In season 4, episode 3 of Orange Is the New Black, an inmate poisons a fellow inmate using Visine; the poisoned inmate immediately experiences explosive diarrhea.

 Visine  is a brand of eye drops produced by Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson acquired Visine, along with Pfizer's entire consumer healthcare portfolio, in December 2006. In some countries it is called Vispring.

Visine Original
The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels.

Administration

Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily .

Adverse effects

Those using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application.
Use of this product can cause a rebound effect causing the redness to worsen. Prolonged use can cause blood vessels to be dilated for an extended period of time. Use should be limited unless specified by a doctor.
A red eye may often be indicative of more serious underlying ocular condition; simply reducing blood flow to the area won't solve the condition and may even exacerbate symptoms.
These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye.
Visine is not to be used by patients with glaucoma since the production of more liquids only contributes to the problem of high pressure within the eye.

Side effects
A common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of explosive diarrhea, akin to that of a laxative. This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as:

Dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia)
Blurred vision
Nausea and vomiting (as opposed to explosive diarrhea)
Difficulty in breathing or even a complete halt in breathing
Elevating (hypertension) then dropping (hypotension) blood pressure
Possible coma
Seizures and tremors
Death

Anyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately. Ingesting Visine was shown to be lethal in the case of Lana Clayton, who killed her husband by administering Visine to his drinks over a period of three days in July 2018.

  The new drug application claiming treatment of a single, self-identified racial group raised a storm of controversy. Some hailed the development of BiDil as a breakthrough for Black Americans (such groups included the congressional Black Caucus, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Medical Association, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and a step to addressing the unique health care needs and health disparities of the African American community. Others who criticized the preliminary studies argued that the original study did not have a significant number of Black-American subjects to make the BiDil's race specific claims, and

  Case study: An 11½-year-old Hmong Laotian boy was brought into the emergency room by his parents with a 2- to 3-month history of decreasing stamina and increasing dyspnea [shortness of breath] on exertion. He described an intermittent nonproductive cough and decreased appetite and was thought to have lost weight. He denied fever, chills, night sweats, headache, palpitations, hemoptysis [coughing up blood], chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea or urticaria [skin rash notable for dark red, raised, itchy bumps]. There were no pets at home. At the time of immigration to the United States 16 months earlier, all family members had negative purified protein derivative intradermal tests except one brother, who was positive but had a normal chest radiograph and subsequently received isoniazid for 12 months... a left lateral thoracotomy was performed during which 1800 ml of an odorless, cloudy, pea soup-like fluid containing a pale yellow, cottage

When the stomach is found below its normal position, the term gastroptosis is used. The condition exists in all degrees of severity and may not give rise to any adverse symptoms. Generally, when adverse symptoms are associated with the condition, however, there may be loss of appetite, heartburn, nervous indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, headache, vertigo, emaciation, and loss of sleep. Any or all of these symptoms may be present. The condition may be brought about by loss of muscular tone, particularly of the abdominal muscles, with relaxation of the ligaments that typically

Drug-seeking tactics that addicts undergo to obtain the medication include "doctor shopping", which is visiting a number of different physicians to obtain additional prescriptions and refusal to follow up with appropriate examinations. Along with the high potential for abuse among people without prescriptions, there is also a risk for physical dependency and reduced reaction or drug desensitization for patients that are prescribed them. Nevertheless, strong analgesic drugs remain indispensable to patients suffering from severe acute and cancer pain.

Popular culture
The effect of Visine causing upset gastrointestinal effects when being ingested is depicted in the movie Wedding Crashers, where John Beckwith (portrayed by Owen Wilson) poisons Sack's (Bradley Cooper) drink, causing him to suffer all night. John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times over the course of the film to fake crying. This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.

The urban legend about Visine's explosive diarrhea-inducing capacity is also perpetuated in the movie version of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell. In the movie, the main character Tucker Max (played by Matt Czuchry), is making fun of two women at the bar, in which one of them squirts Visine into his beer bottle. This leads to Tucker and an allegedly married woman he leaves the bar with to both have extreme explosive diarrhea.

In season 4, episode 3 of Orange Is the New Black, an inmate poisons a fellow inmate using Visine; the poisoned inmate immediately experiences explosive diarrhea.

When only the intestines are involved, the condition is known as enteroptosis. When the stomach is found below its normal position, the term gastroptosis is used. The condition exists in all degrees of severity and may not give rise to any adverse symptoms. Generally, when adverse symptoms are associated with the condition, however, there may be loss of appetite, heartburn, nervous indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, headache, vertigo, emaciation, and loss of sleep.

The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a "black box" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods.

  There are many types of contraceptive methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%).

  Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the Philippine Medical Association also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer". Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines. "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."

  In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the previous federal requirement for employers to cover birth control in the health insurance plans for their employees. Under this new rule, hundreds of thousands of women would lose their ability to have their birth control costs covered for them. The new rule would let insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions". However, later in 2017 federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of this new rule. Push for possible over the counter policies Some doctors and researchers, including the American Medical Association (AMA), would like the availability of the birth control pills to be extended to over the counter instead of prescription only status. They state that providing over the counter contraceptives could increase overall contraceptive accessibility for young

 The FDA has approved Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg, a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.
Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.
• Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years.
• To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. Follow insertion instructions exactly as described.
• Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated.
Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.
Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions reported (≥5% users) were vulvovaginitis, ovarian cysts, abdominal pain/pelvic pain, headache/migraine, acne/seborrhea, dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm, breast pain/breast discomfort, and increased bleeding.

  The combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring is self-administered once a month. Leaving the ring in for three weeks slowly releases hormones into the body, mainly vaginally administered estrogens and/or progestogens (a group of hormones including progesterone) - the same hormones used in birth control pills. These hormones work mostly by stopping ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, creating a barrier preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. They could theoretically affect implantation but no evidence shows that they do. Worn continuously for three weeks followed by a week off, each vaginal ring provides anywhere from one month (NuvaRing) to one year (Annovera and Progering) of birth control.

  Contraception has many benefits beyond preventing pregnancy. Combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives can successfully treat dysmenorrhea (painful periods), provide symptom relief from endometriosis, reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and improve anemia related to menstrual blood loss, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, reduce ovarian and colon cancer risk, reduce moderate acne, prevent of menstrual migraines, and reduce hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). The progestin-containing intrauterine device can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and protect against pre-cancerous changes or cancer in the uterus. Condoms (male or female) are the only contraceptive method which protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections. According to the New York Times of 6 October 2017, the Trump administration at that time moved to expand the rights of employers to not purchase insurance plans that covered contraception for women employees. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, "two rules rolling back a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The rules offer an exemption to any employer that objects to covering contraception services on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions".

  14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical

  testosterone required to increase sexual desire in women may have a significant risk of masculinization with long-term therapy. For this reason, and due to the unknown health effects and safety of testosterone therapy, its use may be inappropriate. In 2003, the FDA rejected Intrinsa, a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The reasons cited were limited efficacy (about one additional sexually satisfying event per month), concerns about safety and potential adverse effects with long-term therapy, and concerns about inappropriate off-label use. It appears that in women, rather than testosterone, estradiol may be the most important hormone

 1 -3.81106 The FDA has approved Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg, a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.
Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.
• Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years.
• To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. Follow insertion instructions exactly as described.
• Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated.
Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.
Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions reported (≥5% users) were vulvovaginitis, ovarian cysts, abdominal pain/pelvic pain, headache/migraine, acne/seborrhea, dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm, breast pain/breast discomfort, and increased bleeding.

 2 -7.77038  There are many types of contraceptive methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%).

In February 2016, the FDA issued a "black box" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods.

 5 -9.73473  In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the previous federal requirement for employers to cover birth control in the health insurance plans for their employees. Under this new rule, hundreds of thousands of women would lose their ability to have their birth control costs covered for them. The new rule would let insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions". However, later in 2017 federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of this new rule. Push for possible over the counter policies Some doctors and researchers, including the American Medical Association (AMA), would like the availability of the birth control pills to be extended to over the counter instead of prescription only status. They state that providing over the counter contraceptives could increase overall contraceptive accessibility for young

In the Blackhawks’ penultimate 2016–17 regular season game, Nick Ritchie of the Anaheim Ducks punched Rozsíval in the face as retaliation for a cross-check he delivered to Corey Perry. Rozsíval suffered a facial fracture that required surgical repairs.

Rozsíval missed the Blackhawks 2016–17 finale and the entire 2017 playoffs due to the injury.
